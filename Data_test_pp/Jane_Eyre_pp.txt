jane eyre an autobiography by charlotte bront illustrated by f h townsend london service paton henrietta street the illustrations in this volume are the copyright of service paton london to w m thackeray esq this work is respectfully inscribed by the author preface a preface to the first edition of jane eyre being unnecessary i gave none this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark my thanks are due in three quarters to the public for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions to the press for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant to my publishers for the aid their tact their energy their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended author the press and the public are but vague personifications for me and i must thank them in vague terms but my publishers are definite so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large hearted and high minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger to them i e to my publishers and the select reviewers i say cordially gentlemen i thank you from my heart having thus acknowledged what i owe those who have aided and approved me i turn to another class a small one so far as i know but not therefore to be overlooked i mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as jane eyre in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry that parent of crime an insult to piety that regent of god on earth i would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions i would remind them of certain simple truths conventionality is not morality self righteousness is not religion to attack the first is not to assail the last to pluck the mask from the face of the pharisee is not to lift an impious hand to the crown of thorns these things and deeds are diametrically opposed they are as distinct as is vice from virtue men too often confound them they should not be confounded appearance should not be mistaken for truth narrow human doctrines that only tend to elate and magnify a few should not be substituted for the world redeeming creed of christ there is i repeat it a difference and it is a good and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them the world may not like to see these ideas dissevered for it has been accustomed to blend them finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth to let white washed walls vouch for clean shrines it may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose to rase the gilding and show base metal under it to penetrate the sepulchre and reveal charnel relics but hate as it will it is indebted to him ahab did not like micaiah because he never prophesied good concerning him but evil probably he liked the sycophant son of chenaanah better yet might ahab have escaped a bloody death had he but stopped his ears to flattery and opened them to faithful counsel there is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears who to my thinking comes before the great ones of society much as the son of imlah came before the throned kings of judah and israel and who speaks truth as deep with a power as prophet like and as vital a mien as dauntless and as daring is the satirist of vanity fair admired in high places i cannot tell but i think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the greek fire of his sarcasm and over whom he flashes the levin brand of his denunciation were to take his warnings in time they or their seed might yet escape a fatal rimoth gilead why have i alluded to this man i have alluded to him reader because i think i see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised because i regard him as the first social regenerator of the day as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things because i think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him the terms which rightly characterise his talent they say he is like fielding they talk of his wit humour comic powers he resembles fielding as an eagle does a vulture fielding could stoop on carrion but thackeray never does his wit is bright his humour attractive but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet lightning playing under the edge of the summer cloud does to the electric death spark hid in its womb finally i have alluded to mr thackeray because to him if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger i have dedicated this second edition of jane eyre currer bell december st note to the third edition i avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of jane eyre affords me of again addressing a word to the public to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone if therefore the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me an honour is awarded where it is not merited and consequently denied where it is justly due this explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made and to prevent future errors currer bell april th chapter i there was no possibility of taking a walk that day we had been wandering indeed in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning but since dinner mrs reed when there was no company dined early the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre and a rain so penetrating that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question i was glad of it i never liked long walks especially on chilly afternoons dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight with nipped fingers and toes and a heart saddened by the chidings of bessie the nurse and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza john and georgiana reed the said eliza john and georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing room she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside and with her darlings about her for the time neither quarrelling nor crying looked perfectly happy me she had dispensed from joining the group saying she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance but that until she heard from bessie and could discover by her own observation that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition a more attractive and sprightly manner something lighter franker more natural as it were she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented happy little children what does bessie say i have done i asked jane i dont like cavillers or questioners besides there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner be seated somewhere and until you can speak pleasantly remain silent a breakfast room adjoined the drawing room i slipped in there it contained a bookcase i soon possessed myself of a volume taking care that it should be one stored with pictures i mounted into the window seat gathering up my feet i sat cross legged like a turk and having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close i was shrined in double retirement folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand to the left were the clear panes of glass protecting but not separating me from the drear november day at intervals while turning over the leaves of my book i studied the aspect of that winter afternoon afar it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud near a scene of wet lawn and storm beat shrub with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast i returned to my book bewicks history of british birds the letterpress thereof i cared little for generally speaking and yet there were certain introductory pages that child as i was i could not pass quite as a blank they were those which treat of the haunts of sea fowl of the solitary rocks and promontories by them only inhabited of the coast of norway studded with isles from its southern extremity the lindeness or naze to the north cape where the northern ocean in vast whirls boils round the naked melancholy isles of farthest thule and the atlantic surge pours in among the stormy hebrides nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of lapland siberia spitzbergen nova zembla iceland greenland with the vast sweep of the arctic zone and those forlorn regions of dreary space that reservoir of frost and snow where firm fields of ice the accumulation of centuries of winters glazed in alpine heights above heights surround the pole and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold of these death white realms i formed an idea of my own shadowy like all the half comprehended notions that float dim through childrens brains but strangely impressive the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking i cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard with its inscribed headstone its gate its two trees its low horizon girdled by a broken wall and its newly risen crescent attesting the hour of eventide the two ships becalmed on a torpid sea i believed to be marine phantoms the fiend pinning down the thiefs pack behind him i passed over quickly it was an object of terror so was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows each picture told a story mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings yet ever profoundly interesting as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings when she chanced to be in good humour and when having brought her ironing table to the nursery hearth she allowed us to sit about it and while she got up mrs reeds lace frills and crimped her nightcap borders fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads or as at a later period i discovered from the pages of pamela and henry earl of moreland with bewick on my knee i was then happy happy at least in my way i feared nothing but interruption and that came too soon the breakfast room door opened boh madam mope cried the voice of john reed then he paused he found the room apparently empty where the dickens is she he continued lizzy georgy calling to his sisters joan is not here tell mama she is run out into the rain bad animal it is well i drew the curtain thought i and i wished fervently he might not discover my hiding place nor would john reed have found it out himself he was not quick either of vision or conception but eliza just put her head in at the door and said at once she is in the window seat to be sure jack and i came out immediately for i trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said jack what do you want i asked with awkward diffidence say what do you want master reed was the answer i want you to come here and seating himself in an arm chair he intimated by a gesture that i was to approach and stand before him john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old four years older than i for i was but ten large and stout for his age with a dingy and unwholesome skin thick lineaments in a spacious visage heavy limbs and large extremities he gorged himself habitually at table which made him bilious and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks he ought now to have been at school but his mama had taken him home for a month or two on account of his delicate health mr miles the master affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home but the mothers heart turned from an opinion so harsh and inclined rather to the more refined idea that johns sallowness was owing to over application and perhaps to pining after home john had not much affection for his mother and sisters and an antipathy to me he bullied and punished me not two or three times in the week nor once or twice in the day but continually every nerve i had feared him and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him and mrs reed was blind and deaf on the subject she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me though he did both now and then in her very presence more frequently however behind her back habitually obedient to john i came up to his chair he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots i knew he would soon strike and while dreading the blow i mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it i wonder if he read that notion in my face for all at once without speaking he struck suddenly and strongly i tottered and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair that is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since said he and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since you rat accustomed to john reeds abuse i never had an idea of replying to it my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult what were you doing behind the curtain he asked i was reading show the book i returned to the window and fetched it thence you have no business to take our books you are a dependent mama says you have no money your father left you none you ought to beg and not to live here with gentlemens children like us and eat the same meals we do and wear clothes at our mamas expense now ill teach you to rummage my bookshelves for they are mine all the house belongs to me or will do in a few years go and stand by the door out of the way of the mirror and the windows i did so not at first aware what was his intention but when i saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it i instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm not soon enough however the volume was flung it hit me and i fell striking my head against the door and cutting it the cut bled the pain was sharp my terror had passed its climax other feelings succeeded wicked and cruel boy i said you are like a murderer you are like a slave driver you are like the roman emperors i had read goldsmiths history of rome and had formed my opinion of nero caligula c also i had drawn parallels in silence which i never thought thus to have declared aloud what what he cried did she say that to me did you hear her eliza and georgiana wont i tell mama but first he ran headlong at me i felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder he had closed with a desperate thing i really saw in him a tyrant a murderer i felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering these sensations for the time predominated over fear and i received him in frantic sort i dont very well know what i did with my hands but he called me rat rat and bellowed out aloud aid was near him eliza and georgiana had run for mrs reed who was gone upstairs she now came upon the scene followed by bessie and her maid abbot we were parted i heard the words dear dear what a fury to fly at master john did ever anybody see such a picture of passion then mrs reed subjoined take her away to the red room and lock her in there four hands were immediately laid upon me and i was borne upstairs chapter ii i resisted all the way a new thing for me and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to entertain of me the fact is i was a trifle beside myself or rather out of myself as the french would say i was conscious that a moments mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties and like any other rebel slave i felt resolved in my desperation to go all lengths hold her arms miss abbot shes like a mad cat for shame for shame cried the ladys maid what shocking conduct miss eyre to strike a young gentleman your benefactresss son your young master master how is he my master am i a servant no you are less than a servant for you do nothing for your keep there sit down and think over your wickedness they had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by mrs reed and had thrust me upon a stool my impulse was to rise from it like a spring their two pair of hands arrested me instantly if you dont sit still you must be tied down said bessie miss abbot lend me your garters she would break mine directly miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature this preparation for bonds and the additional ignominy it inferred took a little of the excitement out of me dont take them off i cried i will not stir in guarantee whereof i attached myself to my seat by my hands mind you dont said bessie and when she had ascertained that i was really subsiding she loosened her hold of me then she and miss abbot stood with folded arms looking darkly and doubtfully on my face as incredulous of my sanity she never did so before at last said bessie turning to the abigail but it was always in her was the reply ive told missis often my opinion about the child and missis agreed with me shes an underhand little thing i never saw a girl of her age with so much cover bessie answered not but ere long addressing me she said you ought to be aware miss that you are under obligations to mrs reed she keeps you if she were to turn you off you would have to go to the poorhouse i had nothing to say to these words they were not new to me my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind this reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing song in my ear very painful and crushing but only half intelligible miss abbot joined in and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the misses reed and master reed because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them they will have a great deal of money and you will have none it is your place to be humble and to try to make yourself agreeable to them what we tell you is for your good added bessie in no harsh voice you should try to be useful and pleasant then perhaps you would have a home here but if you become passionate and rude missis will send you away i am sure besides said miss abbot god will punish her he might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums and then where would she go come bessie we will leave her i wouldnt have her heart for anything say your prayers miss eyre when you are by yourself for if you dont repent something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away they went shutting the door and locking it behind them the red room was a square chamber very seldom slept in i might say never indeed unless when a chance influx of visitors at gateshead hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion a bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany hung with curtains of deep red damask stood out like a tabernacle in the centre the two large windows with their blinds always drawn down were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery the carpet was red the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it the wardrobe the toilet table the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany out of these deep surrounding shades rose high and glared white the piled up mattresses and pillows of the bed spread with a snowy marseilles counterpane scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy chair near the head of the bed also white with a footstool before it and looking as i thought like a pale throne this room was chill because it seldom had a fire it was silent because remote from the nursery and kitchen solemn because it was known to be so seldom entered the house maid alone came here on saturdays to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a weeks quiet dust and mrs reed herself at far intervals visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe where were stored divers parchments her jewel casket and a miniature of her deceased husband and in those last words lies the secret of the red room the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur mr reed had been dead nine years it was in this chamber he breathed his last here he lay in state hence his coffin was borne by the undertakers men and since that day a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion my seat to which bessie and the bitter miss abbot had left me riveted was a low ottoman near the marble chimney piece the bed rose before me to my right hand there was the high dark wardrobe with subdued broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels to my left were the muffled windows a great looking glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room i was not quite sure whether they had locked the door and when i dared move i got up and went to see alas yes no jail was ever more secure returning i had to cross before the looking glass my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed all looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality and the strange little figure there gazing at me with a white face and arms specking the gloom and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still had the effect of a real spirit i thought it like one of the tiny phantoms half fairy half imp bessies evening stories represented as coming out of lone ferny dells in moors and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers i returned to my stool superstition was with me at that moment but it was not yet her hour for complete victory my blood was still warm the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour i had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before i quailed to the dismal present all john reeds violent tyrannies all his sisters proud indifference all his mothers aversion all the servants partiality turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well why was i always suffering always browbeaten always accused for ever condemned why could i never please why was it useless to try to win any ones favour eliza who was headstrong and selfish was respected georgiana who had a spoiled temper a very acrid spite a captious and insolent carriage was universally indulged her beauty her pink cheeks and golden curls seemed to give delight to all who looked at her and to purchase indemnity for every fault john no one thwarted much less punished though he twisted the necks of the pigeons killed the little pea chicks set the dogs at the sheep stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory he called his mother old girl too sometimes reviled her for her dark skin similar to his own bluntly disregarded her wishes not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire and he was still her own darling i dared commit no fault i strove to fulfil every duty and i was termed naughty and tiresome sullen and sneaking from morning to noon and from noon to night my head still ached and bled with the blow and fall i had received no one had reproved john for wantonly striking me and because i had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence i was loaded with general opprobrium unjust unjust said my reason forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power and resolve equally wrought up instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression as running away or if that could not be effected never eating or drinking more and letting myself die what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon how all my brain was in tumult and all my heart in insurrection yet in what darkness what dense ignorance was the mental battle fought i could not answer the ceaseless inward question why i thus suffered now at the distance of i will not say how many years i see it clearly i was a discord in gateshead hall i was like nobody there i had nothing in harmony with mrs reed or her children or her chosen vassalage if they did not love me in fact as little did i love them they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them a heterogeneous thing opposed to them in temperament in capacity in propensities a useless thing incapable of serving their interest or adding to their pleasure a noxious thing cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment of contempt of their judgment i know that had i been a sanguine brilliant careless exacting handsome romping child though equally dependent and friendless mrs reed would have endured my presence more complacently her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow feeling the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery daylight began to forsake the red room it was past four oclock and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight i heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall i grew by degrees cold as a stone and then my courage sank my habitual mood of humiliation self doubt forlorn depression fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire all said i was wicked and perhaps i might be so what thought had i been but just conceiving of starving myself to death that certainly was a crime and was i fit to die or was the vault under the chancel of gateshead church an inviting bourne in such vault i had been told did mr reed lie buried and led by this thought to recall his idea i dwelt on it with gathering dread i could not remember him but i knew that he was my own uncle my mothers brother that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house and that in his last moments he had required a promise of mrs reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children mrs reed probably considered she had kept this promise and so she had i dare say as well as her nature would permit her but how could she really like an interloper not of her race and unconnected with her after her husbands death by any tie it must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group a singular notion dawned upon me i doubted not never doubted that if mr reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly and now as i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror i began to recall what i had heard of dead men troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed and i thought mr reeds spirit harassed by the wrongs of his sisters child might quit its abode whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed and rise before me in this chamber i wiped my tears and hushed my sobs fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me or elicit from the gloom some haloed face bending over me with strange pity this idea consolatory in theory i felt would be terrible if realised with all my might i endeavoured to stifle it i endeavoured to be firm shaking my hair from my eyes i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room at this moment a light gleamed on the wall was it i asked myself a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind no moonlight was still and this stirred while i gazed it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was in all likelihood a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn but then prepared as my mind was for horror shaken as my nerves were by agitation i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world my heart beat thick my head grew hot a sound filled my ears which i deemed the rushing of wings something seemed near me i was oppressed suffocated endurance broke down i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort steps came running along the outer passage the key turned bessie and abbot entered miss eyre are you ill said bessie what a dreadful noise it went quite through me exclaimed abbot take me out let me go into the nursery was my cry what for are you hurt have you seen something again demanded bessie oh i saw a light and i thought a ghost would come i had now got hold of bessies hand and she did not snatch it from me she has screamed out on purpose declared abbot in some disgust and what a scream if she had been in great pain one would have excused it but she only wanted to bring us all here i know her naughty tricks what is all this demanded another voice peremptorily and mrs reed came along the corridor her cap flying wide her gown rustling stormily abbot and bessie i believe i gave orders that jane eyre should be left in the red room till i came to her myself miss jane screamed so loud maam pleaded bessie let her go was the only answer loose bessies hand child you cannot succeed in getting out by these means be assured i abhor artifice particularly in children it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer you will now stay here an hour longer and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that i shall liberate you then o aunt have pity forgive me i cannot endure it let me be punished some other way i shall be killed if silence this violence is all most repulsive and so no doubt she felt it i was a precocious actress in her eyes she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions mean spirit and dangerous duplicity bessie and abbot having retreated mrs reed impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs abruptly thrust me back and locked me in without farther parley i heard her sweeping away and soon after she was gone i suppose i had a species of fit unconsciousness closed the scene chapter iii the next thing i remember is waking up with a feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare and seeing before me a terrible red glare crossed with thick black bars i heard voices too speaking with a hollow sound and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water agitation uncertainty and an all predominating sense of terror confused my faculties ere long i became aware that some one was handling me lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture and that more tenderly than i had ever been raised or upheld before i rested my head against a pillow or an arm and felt easy in five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved i knew quite well that i was in my own bed and that the red glare was the nursery fire it was night a candle burnt on the table bessie stood at the bed foot with a basin in her hand and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow leaning over me i felt an inexpressible relief a soothing conviction of protection and security when i knew that there was a stranger in the room an individual not belonging to gateshead and not related to mrs reed turning from bessie though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of abbot for instance would have been i scrutinised the face of the gentleman i knew him it was mr lloyd an apothecary sometimes called in by mrs reed when the servants were ailing for herself and the children she employed a physician well who am i he asked i pronounced his name offering him at the same time my hand he took it smiling and saying we shall do very well by and by then he laid me down and addressing bessie charged her to be very careful that i was not disturbed during the night having given some further directions and intimated that he should call again the next day he departed to my grief i felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow and as he closed the door after him all the room darkened and my heart again sank inexpressible sadness weighed it down do you feel as if you should sleep miss asked bessie rather softly scarcely dared i answer her for i feared the next sentence might be rough i will try would you like to drink or could you eat anything no thank you bessie then i think i shall go to bed for it is past twelve oclock but you may call me if you want anything in the night wonderful civility this it emboldened me to ask a question bessie what is the matter with me am i ill you fell sick i suppose in the red room with crying youll be better soon no doubt bessie went into the housemaids apartment which was near i heard her say sarah come and sleep with me in the nursery i darent for my life be alone with that poor child to night she might die its such a strange thing she should have that fit i wonder if she saw anything missis was rather too hard sarah came back with her they both went to bed they were whispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep i caught scraps of their conversation from which i was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed something passed her all dressed in white and vanished a great black dog behind him three loud raps on the chamber door a light in the churchyard just over his grave c c at last both slept the fire and the candle went out for me the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness ear eye and mind were alike strained by dread such dread as children only can feel no severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red room it only gave my nerves a shock of which i feel the reverberation to this day yes mrs reed to you i owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering but i ought to forgive you for you knew not what you did while rending my heart strings you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities next day by noon i was up and dressed and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth i felt physically weak and broken down but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears no sooner had i wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed yet i thought i ought to have been happy for none of the reeds were there they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama abbot too was sewing in another room and bessie as she moved hither and thither putting away toys and arranging drawers addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness this state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace accustomed as i was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging but in fact my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe and no pleasure excite them agreeably bessie had been down into the kitchen and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate whose bird of paradise nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration and which plate i had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege this precious vessel was now placed on my knee and i was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it vain favour coming like most other favours long deferred and often wished for too late i could not eat the tart and the plumage of the bird the tints of the flowers seemed strangely faded i put both plate and tart away bessie asked if i would have a book the word book acted as a transient stimulus and i begged her to fetch gullivers travels from the library this book i had again and again perused with delight i considered it a narrative of facts and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what i found in fairy tales for as to the elves having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells under mushrooms and beneath the ground ivy mantling old wall nooks i had at length made up my mind to the sad truth that they were all gone out of england to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker and the population more scant whereas lilliput and brobdignag being in my creed solid parts of the earths surface i doubted not that i might one day by taking a long voyage see with my own eyes the little fields houses and trees the diminutive people the tiny cows sheep and birds of the one realm and the corn fields forest high the mighty mastiffs the monster cats the tower like men and women of the other yet when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand when i turned over its leaves and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm i had till now never failed to find all was eerie and dreary the giants were gaunt goblins the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions i closed the book which i dared no longer peruse and put it on the table beside the untasted tart bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room and having washed her hands she opened a certain little drawer full of splendid shreds of silk and satin and began making a new bonnet for georgianas doll meantime she sang her song was in the days when we went gipsying a long time ago i had often heard the song before and always with lively delight for bessie had a sweet voice at least i thought so but now though her voice was still sweet i found in its melody an indescribable sadness sometimes preoccupied with her work she sang the refrain very low very lingeringly a long time ago came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn she passed into another ballad this time a really doleful one my feet they are sore and my limbs they are weary long is the way and the mountains are wild soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary over the path of the poor orphan child why did they send me so far and so lonely up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled men are hard hearted and kind angels only watch oer the steps of a poor orphan child yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing clouds there are none and clear stars beam mild god in his mercy protection is showing comfort and hope to the poor orphan child evn should i fall oer the broken bridge passing or stray in the marshes by false lights beguiled still will my father with promise and blessing take to his bosom the poor orphan child there is a thought that for strength should avail me though both of shelter and kindred despoiled heaven is a home and a rest will not fail me god is a friend to the poor orphan child come miss jane dont cry said bessie as she finished she might as well have said to the fire dont burn but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which i was a prey in the course of the morning mr lloyd came again what already up said he as he entered the nursery well nurse how is she bessie answered that i was doing very well then she ought to look more cheerful come here miss jane your name is jane is it not yes sir jane eyre well you have been crying miss jane eyre can you tell me what about have you any pain no sir oh i daresay she is crying because she could not go out with missis in the carriage interposed bessie surely not why she is too old for such pettishness i thought so too and my self esteem being wounded by the false charge i answered promptly i never cried for such a thing in my life i hate going out in the carriage i cry because i am miserable oh fie miss said bessie the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled i was standing before him he fixed his eyes on me very steadily his eyes were small and grey not very bright but i dare say i should think them shrewd now he had a hard featured yet good natured looking face having considered me at leisure he said what made you ill yesterday she had a fall said bessie again putting in her word fall why that is like a baby again cant she manage to walk at her age she must be eight or nine years old i was knocked down was the blunt explanation jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride but that did not make me ill i added while mr lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff as he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket a loud bell rang for the servants dinner he knew what it was thats for you nurse said he you can go down ill give miss jane a lecture till you come back bessie would rather have stayed but she was obliged to go because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at gateshead hall the fall did not make you ill what did then pursued mr lloyd when bessie was gone i was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark i saw mr lloyd smile and frown at the same time ghost what you are a baby after all you are afraid of ghosts of mr reeds ghost i am he died in that room and was laid out there neither bessie nor any one else will go into it at night if they can help it and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle so cruel that i think i shall never forget it nonsense and is it that makes you so miserable are you afraid now in daylight no but night will come again before long and besides i am unhappy very unhappy for other things what other things can you tell me some of them how much i wished to reply fully to this question how difficult it was to frame any answer children can feel but they cannot analyse their feelings and if the analysis is partially effected in thought they know not how to express the result of the process in words fearful however of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it i after a disturbed pause contrived to frame a meagre though as far as it went true response for one thing i have no father or mother brothers or sisters you have a kind aunt and cousins again i paused then bunglingly enounced but john reed knocked me down and my aunt shut me up in the red room mr lloyd a second time produced his snuff box dont you think gateshead hall a very beautiful house asked he are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at it is not my house sir and abbot says i have less right to be here than a servant pooh you cant be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place if i had anywhere else to go i should be glad to leave it but i can never get away from gateshead till i am a woman perhaps you may who knows have you any relations besides mrs reed i think not sir none belonging to your father i dont know i asked aunt reed once and she said possibly i might have some poor low relations called eyre but she knew nothing about them if you had such would you like to go to them i reflected poverty looks grim to grown people still more so to children they have not much idea of industrious working respectable poverty they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes scanty food fireless grates rude manners and debasing vices poverty for me was synonymous with degradation no i should not like to belong to poor people was my reply not even if they were kind to you i shook my head i could not see how poor people had the means of being kind and then to learn to speak like them to adopt their manners to be uneducated to grow up like one of the poor women i saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of gateshead no i was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste but are your relatives so very poor are they working people i cannot tell aunt reed says if i have any they must be a beggarly set i should not like to go a begging would you like to go to school again i reflected i scarcely knew what school was bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks wore backboards and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise john reed hated his school and abused his master but john reeds tastes were no rule for mine and if bessies accounts of school discipline gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to gateshead were somewhat appalling her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were i thought equally attractive she boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed of songs they could sing and pieces they could play of purses they could net of french books they could translate till my spirit was moved to emulation as i listened besides school would be a complete change it implied a long journey an entire separation from gateshead an entrance into a new life i should indeed like to go to school was the audible conclusion of my musings well well who knows what may happen said mr lloyd as he got up the child ought to have change of air and scene he added speaking to himself nerves not in a good state bessie now returned at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel walk is that your mistress nurse asked mr lloyd i should like to speak to her before i go bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast room and led the way out in the interview which followed between him and mrs reed i presume from after occurrences that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted for as abbot said in discussing the subject with bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night after i was in bed and as they thought asleep missis was she dared say glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome ill conditioned child who always looked as if she were watching everybody and scheming plots underhand abbot i think gave me credit for being a sort of infantine guy fawkes on that same occasion i learned for the first time from miss abbots communications to bessie that my father had been a poor clergyman that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends who considered the match beneath her that my grandfather reed was so irritated at her disobedience he cut her off without a shilling that after my mother and father had been married a year the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated and where that disease was then prevalent that my mother took the infection from him and both died within a month of each other bessie when she heard this narrative sighed and said poor miss jane is to be pitied too abbot yes responded abbot if she were a nice pretty child one might compassionate her forlornness but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that not a great deal to be sure agreed bessie at any rate a beauty like miss georgiana would be more moving in the same condition yes i doat on miss georgiana cried the fervent abbot little darling with her long curls and her blue eyes and such a sweet colour as she has just as if she were painted bessie i could fancy a welsh rabbit for supper so could i with a roast onion come well go down they went
