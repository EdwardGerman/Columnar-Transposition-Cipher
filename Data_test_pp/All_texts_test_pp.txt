blog covers the top gpus for machine learning and also guides you through the relevant factors to consider to make an informed decision when selecting a gpu for your next machine learning project according to jpr the gpu market is expected to reach million units by at an annual rate of this statistic is a clear indicator of the fact that the use of gpus for machine learning has evolved in recent years deep learning a subset of machine learning necessitates dealing with massive data neural networks parallel computing and the computation of a large number of matrices all these methods use algorithms that process large volumes of data and transform it into usable software this necessitates using a graphic card for processing to perform these tasks with deep learning and neural networks gpus come into play here using gpus you can break down complex tasks and perform multiple operations simultaneously in addition gpus are ideal for developing deep learning and artificial intelligence models as they can handle numerous computations simultaneously before diving into the best gpus for deep learning or the best graphics card for machine learning let us know more about gpus table of contents what is a gpu for machine learning why are gpus better than cpus for machine learning how do gpus for machine learning work how to choose the best gpu for machine learning factors to consider when selecting gpus for machine learning algorithm factors affecting gpu use for machine learning best gpus for machine learning in the market best gpus for deep learning best nvidia gpus for deep learning best gpus for deep learning best budget gpus for deep learning key takeaways faqs on gpu for machine learning what is a gpu for machine learning a gpu graphic processing unit is a logic chip that renders graphics on display images videos or games a gpu is sometimes also referred to as a processor or a graphics card gpus are used for different types of work such as video editing gaming designing programs and machine learning ml thus they are ideal for designers developers or anybody looking for high quality visuals it is possible however to find a gpu integrated into a motherboard or in the daughterboard of a graphics card initially graphic cards were only available on high configuration computers but today most desktop computers use a separate graphics card with a gpu rather than one built into the motherboard for increased performance why are gpus better than cpus for machine learning when it comes to machine learning even a very basic gpu outperforms a cpu but why so gpus offer significant speed ups over cpus when it comes to deep neural networks gpus are faster for computing than cpus this is because they are ideal for parallel computing and can perform multiple tasks simultaneously while cpus perform sequential tasks in addition gpus are ideal for the computation of artificial intelligence and deep learning applications since data science model training is based on simple matrix operations gpus can be used safely for deep learning gpus can execute many parallel computations and increase the quality of images on the screen gpus assemble many specialized cores that deal with huge data sets and deliver massive performance a gpu devotes more transistors to arithmetic logic than a cpu does to caching and flow control deep learning gpus provide high performance computing power on a single chip while supporting modern machine learning frameworks like tensorflow and pytorch with little or no setup how do gpus for deep learning work graphical processing units gpus are built explicitly for graphics processing which requires complex mathematical calculations running parallel to display images on the screen a gpu receives graphic information such as image geometry color and textures from the cpu and executes them to draw images on the screen thus this is how a gpu works to render images on the screen this complete process of taking instructions to create a final image on the screen is known as rendering for instance video graphics are made up of polygonal coordinates translated into bitmaps and then into signals shown on a screen this translation necessitates massive processing power from the graphics processing unit gpu which makes gpus useful in machine learning artificial intelligence and other deep learning tasks that necessitate complex computations why use gpus for ml the next most important question to be answered is why use gpus for machine learning or why are gpus better for machine learning read on to find out the concept of deep learning involves complex computing tasks such as training deep neural networks mathematical modeling using matrix calculations and working with d graphics all these deep learning tasks require choosing a reasonably powerful gpu a distinctive gpu not only helps with a high quality image but also increases the efficiency of the cpu and achieves outstanding performance thus investing in a top quality gpu is best to speed up the model training process on the other hand gpus have dedicated video ram vram which provides the required memory bandwidth for massive datasets while freeing up cpu time for different operations they also enable you to parallelize training tasks by dividing them among processor clusters and carrying out computation operations simultaneously gpus can perform simultaneous computations involved in machine learning it is also important to note that you dont need gpus to learn machine learning or deep learning they are essential only when you want to speed up your things while working with complex models huge datasets and a large number of images but how do you choose the best gpu for machine learning lets find out how to choose the best gpu for machine learning with this rapidly growing field of gpus various options are available in the market to keep the need of designers and data scientists therefore it is essential to keep several factors in mind before purchasing a gpu for machine learning factors to consider when selecting gpus for machine learning below you will find the factors one must consider while deciding on the best graphics card for ai ml dl projects factors to consider when selecting a gpu compatibility the gpus compatibility with your computer or laptop should be your primary concern does your devices gpu perform well you can also check the display ports and cables for deep learning applications memory capacity the first and most important requirement for selecting gpus for machine learning is more ram deep learning necessitates intense gpu memory capacity for example algorithms that use long videos as training data sets require gpus with greater memory compared to this the fundamental training data sets function effectively on cloud gpus with less memory memory bandwidth large datasets require a lot of memory bandwidth which gpus may provide this is due to the separate video ram vram found in gpus which lets you save cpu memory for other uses gpus interconnecting ability the ability to connect multiple gpus is closely related to your scalability and distributed training strategies as a result one should consider which gpu units can be interconnected when selecting a gpu for machine learning tdp value gpus can sometimes overheat as indicated by the tdp value they can heat up more quickly when they need more electricity to operate so it is necessary to keep gpus at a cool temperature steam processors steam processors also called cuda cores are suitable for professional players and deep learning a gpu with a high cuda core increases work efficiency in deep learning applications looking for end to end solved data science projects check out projectpros repository of solved data science projects with source code algorithm factors affecting gpu use for machine learning algorithm factors affecting gpu usage when it comes to gpu usage algorithmic factors are equally important and must be considered listed below are three factors to consider when scaling your algorithm across multiple gpu for ml data parallelism it is essential to consider how much data your algorithms will need to handle if the data set is large the chosen gpu should be able to function efficiently on multi gpu training if the data set is large you must ensure the servers can communicate quickly with storage components to enable effective distributed training memory use another essential factor you must consider for gpu usage is the memory requirements for training datasets for example algorithms that use long videos or medical pictures as training data sets require a gpu with large memory on the other hand simple training data sets used for basic predictions need less gpu memory to work gpu performance the models performance also influences gpu selection regular gpus for example are used for development and debugging strong and powerful gpus are required for model fine tuning to accelerate training time and reduce waiting hours best gpus for machine learning in the market so what makes gpu ideal for machine learning this is because of a variety of reasons gpus are designed to do multiple computations in parallel which is excellent for deep learning algorithms highly parallel nature they also contain a large amount of memory which is useful for deep learning models that require a lot of data it is also important to note that large scale operations rarely buy gpus unless they have their specialized processing cloud organizations running machine learning workloads instead acquire cloud space optimized for high performance computing these cloud providers platforms feature high performance gpus and fast memory but from where do they buy the best gpu for ai training gpu market players nvidia and amd gpu market players there are two major players in the machine learning gpu market amd and nvidia there are a large number of gpus used for deep learning however nvidia makes the majority of the best ones nvidia dominates the market of gpus especially for deep learning and complex neural networks because of their substantial

deep learning projects neural network projects tensorflow projects keras deep learning projects nlp projects pytorch data science projects in banking and finance data science projects in retail ecommerce data science projects in entertainment media data science projects in telecommunications nvidia gpu for deep learning nvidia is a popular choice because of its libraries known as the cuda toolkit these libraries make it simple to set up deep learning processes and provide the foundation of a robust machine learning community using nvidia products in addition to gpus nvidia also provides libraries for popular deep learning frameworks such as pytorch and tensorflow the nvidia deep learning sdk adds gpu acceleration to popular deep learning frameworks data scientists may use powerful tools and frameworks to create and deploy deep learning applications nvidias downside is that it has lately set limits on when you may use cuda due to these constraints the libraries can only be used with tesla gpus not with less costly rtx or gtx hardware this has significant financial implications for firms training deep learning models it is also problematic when you consider that while tesla gpus may not provide considerably greater performance than the alternatives the units cost up to ten times as much amd gpu for deep learning amd gpus are excellent for gaming but nvidia outperforms when deep learning comes into the picture amd gpus are less in use because of software optimization and drivers that need to be frequently updated while on the nvidia side they have superior drivers with frequent updates and on top of that cuda and cudnn help accelerate computation amd gpus have extremely minimal software support amd provides libraries such as rocm all significant network architectures as well as tensorflow and pytorch support these libraries however community support for the development of new networks is minimal best gpu for deep learning looking

editors in the team zero etl chatgpt and the future of data engineering the post modern data stack is coming are we ready barr moses if you dont like change data engineering is not for you little in this space has escaped reinvention the most prominent recent examples are snowflake and databricks disrupting the concept of the database and ushering in the modern data stack era as part of this movement fivetran and dbt fundamentally altered the data pipeline from etl to elt hightouch interrupted saas eating the world in an attempt to shift the center of gravity to the data warehouse monte carlo joined the fray and said maybe having engineers manually code unit tests isnt the best way to ensure data quality today data engineers continue to stomp on hard coded pipelines and on premises servers as they march up the modern data stack slope of enlightenment the inevitable consolidation and trough of disillusionment appear at a safe distance on the horizon and so it almost seems unfair that new ideas are already springing up to disrupt the disruptors zero etl has data ingestion in its sights ai and large language models could transform transformation data product containers are eyeing the tables thrown as the core building block of data are we going to have to rebuild everything again the body of the hadoop era isnt even all that cold the answer is yes of course we will have to rebuild our data systems probably several times throughout our careers the real questions are the why when and the how in that order i dont profess to have all the answers or a crystal ball but this article will closely examine some of the most prominent near ish future ideas that may become part of the post modern data stack as well as their potential impact on data engineering practicalities and tradeoffs the modern data stack didnt arise because it did everything better than its predecessor there are real trade offs data is bigger and faster but its also messier and less governed the jury is still out on cost efficiency the modern data stack reigns supreme because it supports use cases and unlocks value from data in ways that were previously if not impossible then certainly very difficult machine learning moved from buzz word to revenue generator analytics and experimentation can go deeper to support bigger decisions the same will be true for each of the trends below there will be pros and cons but what will drive adoption is how they or the dark horse idea we havent yet discovered unlock new ways to leverage data lets look closer at each zero etl what it is a misnomer for one thing the data pipeline still exists today data is often generated by a service and written into a transactional database an automatic pipeline is deployed which not only moves the raw data to the analytical data warehouse but modifies it slightly along the way for example apis will export data in json format and the ingestion pipeline will need to not only transport the data but apply light transformation to ensure it is in a table format that can be loaded into the data warehouse other common light transformations done within the ingestion phase are data formatting and deduplication while you can do heavier transformations by hard coding pipelines in python and some have advocated for doing just that to deliver data pre modeled to the warehouse most data teams choose not to do so for expediency and visibility quality reasons zero etl changes this ingestion process by having the transactional database do the data cleaning and normalization prior to automatically loading it into the data warehouse its important to note the data is still in a relatively raw state at the moment this tight integration is possible because most zero etl architectures require both the transactional database and data warehouse to be from the same cloud provider pros reduced latency no duplicate data storage one less source for failure cons less ability to customize how the data is treated during the ingestion phase some vendor lock in whos driving it aws is the driver behind the buzzword aurora to redshift but gcp bigtable to bigquery and snowflake unistore all offer similar capabilities snowflake secure data sharing and databricks delta sharing are also pursuing what they call no copy data sharing this process actually doesnt involve etl and instead provides expanded access to the data where its stored practicality and value unlock potential on one hand with the tech giants behind it and ready to go capabilities zero etl seems like its only a matter of time on the other ive observed data teams decoupling rather than more tightly integrating their operational and analytical databases to prevent unexpected schema changes from crashing the entire operation this innovation could further lower the visibility and accountability of software engineers toward the data their services produce why should they care about the schema when the data is already on its way to the warehouse shortly after the code is committed with data steaming and micro batch approaches seeming to serve most demands for real time data at the moment i see the primary business driver for this type of innovation as infrastructure simplification and while thats nothing to scoff at the possibility for no copy data sharing to remove obstacles to lengthy security reviews may result in greater adoption in the long run although to be clear its not an either or one big table and large language models what it is currently business stakeholders need to express their requirements metrics and logic to data professionals who then translate it all into a sql query and maybe even a dashboard that process takes time even when all the data already exists within the data warehouse not to mention on the data teams list of favorite activities ad hoc data requests rank somewhere between root canal and documentation there is a bevy of startups aiming to take the power of large language models like gpt to automate that process by letting consumers query the data in their natural language in a slick interface at least until our new robot overlords make binary the new official language this would radically simplify the self service analytics process and further democratize data but it will be difficult to solve beyond basic metric fetching given the complexity of data pipelines for more advanced analytics but what if that complexity was simplified by stuffing all the raw data into one big table that was the idea put forth by benn stancil one of datas best and forward thinking writer founders no one has imagined the death of the modern data stack more as a concept its not that far fetched some data teams already leverage a one big table obt strategy which has both proponents and detractors leveraging large language models would seem to overcome one of the biggest challenges of using the one big table which is the difficulty of discovery pattern recognition and its complete lack of organization its helpful for humans to have a table of contents and well marked chapters for their story but ai doesnt care pros perhaps finally delivering on the promise of self service data analytics speed to insights enables the data team to spend more time unlocking data value and building and less time responding to ad hoc queries cons is it too much freedom data professionals are familiar with the painful eccentricities of data time zones what is an account to an extent most business stakeholders are not do we benefit from having a representational rather than direct data democracy whos driving it super early startups such as delphi and getdot ai startups such as narrator more established players doing some version of this such as amazon quicksight tableau ask data or thoughtspot practicality and value unlock potential refreshingly this is not a technology in search of a use case the value and efficiencies are evident but so are the technical challenges this vision is still being built and will need more time to develop perhaps the biggest obstacle to adoption will be the infrastructure disruption required which will likely be too risky for more established organizations data product containers what it is a data table is the building block of data from which data products are built in fact many data leaders consider production tables to be their data products however for a data table to be treated like a product a lot of functionality needs to be layered on including access management discovery and data reliability containerization has been integral to the microservices movement in software engineering they enhance portability infrastructure abstraction and ultimately enable organizations to scale microservices the data product container concept imagines a similar containerization of the data table data product containers may prove to be an effective mechanism for making data much more reliable and governable especially if they can better surface information such as the semantic definition data lineage and quality metrics associated with the underlying unit of data pros data product containers look to be a way to better package and execute on the four data mesh principles federated governance data self service treating data like a product domain first infrastructure cons will this concept make it easier or more difficult for organizations to scale their data products another fundamental question which could be asked of many of these futuristic data trends is do the byproducts of data pipelines code data metadata contain value for data teams that is worth preserving whos driving it nextdata the startup founded by data mesh creator zhamak dehgahni nexla has been playing in this space as well practicality and value unlock potential while nextdata has only recently emerged from stealth and data product containers are still evolving many data teams have seen proven results from data mesh implementations the future of the data table will be dependent on the exact shape and execution of these containers the endless reimagination of the data lifecycle to peer into the data future we need to look over our shoulder at the data past and present past present future data infrastructures are in a constant state of disruption and rebirth although perhaps we need some more chaos the meaning of data warehouse has changed drastically from the term introduced by bill inmon in the s etl pipelines are now elt pipelines the data lake is not as amorphous as it was just two years ago with these innovations ushered in by the modern data stack data engineers have still played a central technical role in dictating how data moves and how data consumers access it but some changes are bigger and scarier than others the term zero etl seems threatening because it inaccurately suggests the death of pipelines and without pipelines do we need data engineers for all the hype behind chatgpts ability to generate code this process is still very much in the hands of technical data engineers who still need to review and debug the scary aspect about large language models is how they might fundamentally warp the data pipeline or our relationship with data consumers and how data is served to them however this future if and when it comes to pass is still strongly reliant on data engineers what has endured since the dawn of time is the general lifecycle of data it is emitted it is shaped it is used and then it is archived best to avoid dwelling on our own mortality here while the underlying infrastructure may change and automations will shift time and attention to the right or left human data engineers will continue to play a crucial role in extracting value from data for the foreseeable future its not because future technologies and innovations cant simplify the complex data infrastructures of today its because our demand and uses for data will continue to increase in sophistication and scale big data has and always will be a pendulum swinging back and forth we make a leap forward in capacity and then we just as quickly figure out a way to reach those boundaries until the next leap is required take comfort in this cycle its nice to be needed shane murray co authored this article subscribe to get his stories delivered to your inbox

sucks they should dropped a moab bunker buster on the entire neighborhood huh cardioid for equal radii and an epicycloid for unequal radii otherwise it is all quite good but consider a pair of meshing gearwheels with one of three times the diameter of the other the big one will have three times as many teeth as the small one and for each one if its revolutions the smaller gearwheel will rotate three times not four oh what fun great video just came to watched this video looking at a maths problem didnt have any idea it would also explain the concept of sidereal day which i havent ever understood till today your videos are concise yet fully understandable there is a much easier way to see this thought they would hit it in the video but they did not apparently do not roll the circle a this will make it much easier to see what happens and why take a with a fixed point on the edge attach that point to a straight line the length of b circumference slide the point on a along the straight line b a does not rotate now curve the straight line b back around into the circle b again slide the single point on a along the now circular b circumference the curvature of b rotates a once as you go around the degrees of this rotation come entirely from the curvature of b swinging a around not from a rolling then a of course has its three rolls when you do roll a on b others have said similar things but you really need to fix the point on a and not roll the circle then compare the straight b vs the circled b to really understand the difference correctly this problem is actually far more complicated than most reply which have commented here if we only calculate that the center of the circle of small coins travels four times the radius then we only need to travel four times in fact many logical problems are ignored wikipedias description of this problem includes a picture of a colorful circle which clearly shows that if the circumference is divided into parts each of which is degrees the circumference of the small coin has indeed only traveled three times not four but why does the experiment appear to be four circles the reason is three circles is relative to the circumference of the small coin four circles is relative to the the center of the small coin circumference of the small coin travelled circles centre of the small coin travelled circles just shrink the coins head to infinitesimal size and use the concept of differentiation to understand the direction of the head can represent the direction of the centre of the small coin but why do the circumference travelled and the center travelled have different values the reason is that the distance traveled by the center of the circle is longer in this problem when the circumference travels three times the center needs to travel four times of circumference therefore at the same time the center of the circle moves four times and the circumference moves three times their speeds are fundamentally different but why can the same coin accommodate these different speeds the reason is that even if they belong to the same solid body the center and circumference of the circle are on different movement curves but the coin is a concrete material why the times of centre rotated is different from the circumference rotated it is the most difficult part of this question isnt this a problem of perspective people who see the outer circle making one additional revolution are being fooled by perspective in your study it is the only way to see the additional revolution when there are two ways of proving the original answer in the end given the ambiguity of the question itself the scorers should have simply agreed that both answers would be marked as correct despite there really only being one answer i actually got the correct answer when considering it for a minute in my mind but then saw that it wasnt an option so i thought i must have gotten something wrong and then also chose the curse of my life not trusting in my own abilities enough always thinking the mistake must lie with me first edit and i actually intuited the exact same correct explanation in my mind with times circumference going around the circle but still thought i must be wrong when not presented with the right choice aggravating so probably about everyone got their point out of the question because answer b was deemed correct i was biased w the title so after reaching an initial answer of in few seconds i thought about it and decided to make the shapes triangles since i couldnt track the rotation in my mind without drawing it then i realized theres more angle to cover deg to reset the position of start w angles there would be one more but i got real confused cause there were no option w as the answer as jee aspirant i got planet orange purple ring i believe every problem should be simplified the outer circle rotates around the center of the inner circle therefore the amount of revolutions is equal to the sum of the radii of both circles probably at least half of my time during school tests was spent figuring out which answers did the teachers expect instead of the right one the amount of ambiguity and assumptions was staggering great video sir please keep up the good work cad thanks answer pid pid or pi pi or b havent watched it yet its and now how did i do without watching the video i saw them as gears so thought i thought from the available answers but i felt it was wrong for some reason i immediately thought because of the wording its funny how only students out of thousands who took the test found the error yet in this chat many people claimed to find the screw up i guess were just smarter than your s kids either that or were more full of it as we type utter bs on youtube videos certainly heres a refined version of your text i found myself captivated by the video requiring multiple viewings to fully grasp its mesmerizing effect however upon closer inspection a subtle flaw emerged initially escaping my notice when the coin was set into motion the top of the head aligned with the top but as the rotation progressed halfway the section that initially made contact at the top now lacked any connection its a testament to the power of perception standing on the opposite side of the table turning in tandem with the coin transforms the head into an upside down perspective a marked bottom revealed that it never quite returned to its original contact point at the bottom even though during the flat run a portion of the head seemed to make contact upside down wrapping the straight around the main coin clarified that the upside down head was in fact facing upward this illusion extends to the cardboard cut out as well the rotation seemingly stops just when the a becomes legible but a simple test involving a marked starting point with a pen reveals that the circle needs to turn further to re establish the same contact point its a fascinating illusion showcasing the intricate interplay of visual perception please do it again by marking a start point the fact that i actually thought immediatly that its my thought proces didnt include the rotation paradox but i imagined it in my head going around portuguese dubs cool whelp i took the sat and i got it wrong i used to think i was good at math lol there are regions in the us where the sat was never expected instead the act was i tried to figure out how many times the small circle would rotate to get the answer and i thought it was around i thought the answer was therefore as that was the closest to my estimate turns out my intuition lined up with what the actual answer was being an amateur astronomer i also had heard the term sidereal as you can enter that into your telescope as certain settings never heard a good explanation for what that meant loved this video maths problems on uk test papers are normally deliberately and obviously not too scale to ensure students do the maths to find the answer and dont measure the diagram source ive looked at several gcse past papers recently scam ads yep i picked another great example of how reality diverges from our intuition what is ur email i want to send you my ideas i paused the video my answer is but when the point the circumference moves its does not move in a straight line so my the sense tell me its why isnt the answer as simple as the initial intersection point touches the big circle three times in one circumnavigation so the answer is plus for the circumnavigation equals itll give you minutes back in your life stopped to try and think the question seems like it should be times due to radius difference plus one more due to the full rotation of the point of contact to circle b interested to see how far off the answer really is i found his explanation very intriguing i think he would be a great teacher this was also a lot of fun to watch how could some people peoples score go down by throwing a question out do the remaining questions now carry slightly more point value so a wrong answer is now more negative consider the students who failed the test by point as soon as i saw the question i thought the answer was but it turned out to be much more very interesting video if they had asked the question to milling machine operators they would have get the correct answer calculating toolpaths is done in this branch on a daily basis and they would have said plus one diameter of the tool on the outside of the contour and minus one diameter of the tool on the inside of the contour everyone keeps using the word rotation the question asks how many revolutions it will take to get to the starting point my answer is oh wow my dumb dumb butt guess of was actually right i just imagined circle is degrees and cut into pieces for the size of that smaller coin kind of like in the video you have minute per question its multiple choice for a reason you dont need to do a full interpretation of the wording or show your work you can justify just select and move on theres no time to waste people get screwed over because of their perfectionism and wasting more time on this than it was worth turned out it was worth it sucks but that should your strategy be if you have doubts and spare time at the end you can always go back to the question we had the same test question in middle school but with two equal sized coins most classmates got it wrong and i dont think anyone understood the math teachers explanation afterwards we just had to accept and memorize the answer after trying it out with real coins ahhh that circle moving inside the larger circle should be spinning the other way men sacrificed their hairline in pursuit of knowledge i know i am asian but it was stupidly easy i got in like a second if you grow a to be the same perimeter as b then n xpixr xpixr is the equation to solve i was so confused i found different ways of calculating it both for an answer of but wasnt in the options so i spent a good minutes trying to figure out what i did wrong and how to get a different idea i was about to pick because its the closest option wow great video you have a good enough mathematics intuition for studying mathematics yet youre technically wrong lol got that right on first try being completely honest had a pi component left but realized that distance covered by a circle in one revolution is pi r and not r p dont know much about formulas to calculate the rotations the way they did but i could see the rotations in my mind and was confused with the answers provided thought i must be mistaken somehow but when they said hilarious interesting video this is a great example of read the question which i am always telling my students the last line says how many revolutions of circle a will the center of circle first reach its starting point so as pointed out if you take the ratio of the distance travelled by the centre of the circle over the circumference of the smaller wheel you get irrespective of what is happening at the edge of the circle it seems to me that instead of throwing that question out they should have just given all test takers credit for that question throwing it out altogether does seem somewhat unfair for the test writers error i love the little not to scale in showing the earth rotating around the sun lol i came up with cuz it looked like itd go around times opened the video saw it was multiple choice chose cuz thats the closest to my original answer and was pretty surprised when i turned out to be right im glad i wasnt stupid when i heard revolves and thought obviously it is it takes one revolution around circle b to get to the starting point that is literally the definition of revolution the correct answer is explanation starts at mark i stopped the video at and now we will see how much of an idiot i am i know the circumference of a circle is r so the large circle should have a circumference of about and the smaller circle is about so it should be revolutions now ill watch the video to be told why i am wrong obviously i must be wrong or lots of people would not have missed the question i dont think this is always the case but for this example i also noticed that the initial contact point between circle a and circle b is degrees away from the location of the letter a or the top of the circle each quarter rotation of circle a around circle b or one full circle a rotation moves the initial contact point degrees away from its last location doing this four times gives the extra rotation x this exact math probably only works out for these specific circles but i would imagine there is something similar happening between any two circles with the two quarters being equally sized the initial contact point is degrees away from its previous location after the rotating quarter makes one full revolution after two revolutions there is another extra rotation x im not sure i can articulate it any better than this fascinating and extremely well made even by veritasium standards my knee jerk answer was also based on my assumption of what the problem was designed to test blinded by the fact that i am a geometry teacher i guess if i had to speculate i would say that the test makers probably initially envisioned the problem with the small circle rolling on a straight line representing the flattened out circumference of the larger circle since they were presumably trying to design an item to test students understanding of similarity they never reexamined their assumptions when they chose the more challenging diagram representation its a great lesson in the need to physically test our ideas loved the astronomy connection i figured it out after i saw the coins tricky i probably would have marked on the test interesting that the question makers made that mistake in my head popped almost instantly because essentially you are tracing a circle with a radius of r r r with the options laid out i really was confused i came up with the answer in a second or two and then wondered how could that possibly be incorrect i spent the next minutes learning how great video excellent video hopefully we can add perspective to the magic while excluding frames of reference and relativity concerns although a really nice segway to those areas as pointed out by jungreis at the center of circle a travels a circular path around circle b of length pi rb ra where rb is the radius of b and ra is the radius of a assuming circle a stays in contact without slipping then since the circumference of circle a is pi ra the number of turns circle a needs to make is rb ra ra where the pi terms cancel out for the sat question given a is so rb ra then the number of turns is ra ra ra or again not a sat multple choice option taking the veritasium simplest example of two identical coins ra rb then the number of turns is again rb ra ra and substituting gives what you did with physical models i did this in my head with imaginary lines on both circles on the paper i just completed one rotation at o clock so the answer that i concluded was but this was the dumbest way of doing this visually since the pictures of both circles could have been inaccurate i would have selected in the test since wasnt there people who selected three at the very least applied some math to it math is a gift for solving problems where you do not have the resources to physically check and i tried this in the reverse order the comment of darth insidious made a little bit of sense to me this is the most f ed up thing i have ever seen i wonder how many engineering outcomes ended up other than expected due to the natural assumption of rotations huge props to the women that calculated the orbits and trajectory for the space program and got it right i got as my first guess then saw you give the options and not see anything that high and chose no wonder everyone got it wrong there was literally no right answer listed lmao its not like people couldnt have figured it out i think any transmission or differential expert designer would probably get this if you think of it as a gear rotating around the other gear i think you can get it if you have experience i dont but my dad did i did it a slightly different way imagine the centres of the circles are fixed and the circles rotate like gears rotate circle b once counter clockwise circle a will rotate times clockwise as its the size now unpin the circles centres and lock the together so they no longer move with respect to each other as we rotated circle b once counter clockwise we need to rotate the entire system once clockwise to compensate and make the total rotations for circle b equal to this rotates circle a clockwise one more time for a total of i answered because it was the closest one by eye even knowing how this works seeing the rotation in action feels like witnessing black magic lol congrats on including the sidereal year in this presentation only hell matt stone one of the creators of south park is a sat math nerd and readily admits it ffs and youre using this g uy like hes a math expert even more ffs yeah now it got it its a thing of flat and curved space means circle will cover pi r when it rolls a straight line not on anothe circle or a sphere lol the nvt needs to calm down the sats and college is not at all the only path to being a productive member of society i chose because i visually rotated the smaller circle in my mind around the bigger circle idk how i can do that i just can cannot be the answer the questions talks about the rolling of a around b not asking how many times does a revolve around b i dont know how to do the math but youre effectively measuring the distance the center point of the outer circle travels around the center circle not the path of its edge right old news doing this before i see the answer i think its d edit darn i thought i had it for sure where reference to alex belloss can you solve my problems i have a question sir when we choose the bigger circle as frame of reference we assume the velocity of centre of smaller circle as v but when we choose smaller circle as frame of reference that means we assume smaller circle at rest so relative to the smaller circle the velocity of centre of larger circle should be v not the point you choose in video fantastic it gets you wrong so many times it is really cool i noticed that how could no one get it right people guess so i knew the answer probably was not listed my first answer was then i figured that i might be wrong so i chose three the analysis was terrific i really had no analysis close to this awesome quickly realized that would be the correct answer if the question asked how many times circle a would have to spin in place for b to revolve just once but that it didnt feel right for going around b because the angle at which they were in contact kept changing the other answers only seemed worse though my instinct told me that it would be a full revolution more or less but it took me a few minutes to actually prove it to myself i paused the video to figure it out ill keep watching after this but im going to say the correct answer is because the center point of a must traverse a circle that is times the radius of a my answer was do lower sat scores prevent one from becoming a plumber electrician mechanic or carpenter nope so if your cannot get into college you can earn lots of money instead of getting deep into debt to get a degree that will qualify you to work in burger king it s a easy problem if you use some little equations from elementary physics first the center of the little coin must describe a circumference of r r r radius so the center of the little coin must travel a distance of r pi units that is equal to pi r units then we can use the fact that in circular movement the distance must be equal to the product of the angle and the radius so the angle the little coin should turn is is pi r divided by r that is pi radians using the fact that pi radians is one complete turn we have complete turns the general result reached in the video seems very interesting to me thank you for showing it i got it right in the first place if you visualise it correctly and understand the question properly then the ans is yours let radius of b is and radius of a is now consider centre of circle a as a point and forget about circle a for centre to came back to its origin point it has to rotate around the circle with radius units units for circle b and unit for a which is the distance between centre and circle b if you draw it and visualise correctly then its very easy to understand so the distance that centre travelled is actually the circumference of a circle having radius units which is equal to pi apparently that one rotation is not one rotation but only th rotation so it requires of rotations like that ive never felt so proud of myself getting it right i am teaching hs physics and the first thing that came to my mind is rolling without slipping i got the answer within seconds my answer is b before wacthing the video lmao i got by the logic that the center is going to move in a circle having a radius of so pi pi but i thought it would be wrong since it wasnt in the options is it since travelling of a creates a circle with radius then pi pi shitty grammar too the correct answer is not the circumference of a is whereas the circumference of b is which is ax the is incorrect be cause its not making full rotation your counting it as full rotation because the letter a is facing north again which isnt a full rotation because the point you started at lets say a is north you started at exactly east and counted a full rotation when when when south of a touched the big circle a full rotation should have been counted when east of a touched the big circle again and meaning the correct answer is not those three students are delusional i was bad in math but good in english my immediate answer to the question was because i focused on the word revolution as i understood it circle a revolved around circle b only once but circle a rotated on its axis several times so we all got it right if we answer thats what counts vertasium does this mean our observed days per year for other planets is off or have we accounted for that why i looked at this vid at am i saw the thumbnail and thought oh a wave function im still only minutes in and i think its edit boom praise fourier that final bit about the sidereal year is mind blowing to me strange how sat has changed i took an sat each of my last two years in high school probably and i had never heard of the sat before taking it it was only the week before the test that we were told that next week wed all be taking some test and we didnt need to study for it just remember to bring two pencils i had no idea what the test was for we just didnt pay much mind to it many years later i heard of people going to quite a bit of trouble to study for the sat there were books telling you how to prepare for it it became a big deal to do well on the test now apparently it doesnt matter anymore this is the first ive heard that but then i dont keep track of these things gotta love the college board as explained at time in the video and are both valid answers depending on which reference is used to define the number of rotations i would argue that the original test was listing suggesting one valid answer but it failed to define explicitly where the observer is lol the first time i saw the question i answer by using the astronomical definition even better is it that chatgpt gets it wrong too if you aske i got it right yay i just pictured the diameter a circum being a stragiht line and pictured it laying around the circum of b and came up with and figured something is wrong with the test pi x d divide the two but the question asks when will it first reach the starting point that answer is which is what i thought you would end up with thats not math its a language anomaly well strictly speaking the center will be at the center all the time so the correct answer is but hey that is twisting the words so the answer you want needs a little bit more time to be solved this worlds technology and advancements would not be possible without the nerds nerds we all appreciate you or the radias is not a constant the question is intentionally unclear teachers will never admit they are wrong accept this truth show them the correct answer and move on they will know you know that you are smarter than them but they will never admit to that either move on wow i cant believe i got the right answer d when you said at the start to pause the video and attempt to solve the problem yourself my answer was but it wasnt on the answer list so i thought the math would be more a lot more complicated than just x pi pi since it is a multiple choice question how could everybody get it wrong mind blown yep i guessed my sat score reflects my success using math great video and thanks the point here is the meaning of words i am isl so it takes me longer to catch up to this details oh i get it wording does mean alot when discribing cause and effects or something close to what i said because not sure i used the words correctly since it takes effort to fully know the meaning of words credit to the mathematician who explained the answer so that a middle school student could understand thats a skill only the best have phonetically its pronounced sn y ou cur you are slightly wrong i think i think you have made a slight mistake you are running another same radius coin on a coin that is in rest how can you be sure that a rotation is completed see at the beginning of the rotation the r d space between r alphabet of the word quartet and d alphabet of the word dollar in the moving coin part of the moving coin was in contact with the rest coin a rotation is completed only when the r d part of the moving coin touches the rest coin again but when you are counting one rotation the r d part was against the fixed coin and didnt touch the rest coin according to me running coins of equal radius on each other will complete rotation reply please i paused at to think about the question and came up with because i read a title i figured it has a trick and because the circle goes around i figured it has to do one extra turn but then you laid possible answers and i was confused but i dont know if i wouldve arrived at that answer had i not known it was a tricky question to spot this trick you have to think independently and given the answers were presented to those students question the authority okay this is the proof that we live in the matrix obi wan kenobe would say that the answer is from a certain point of view a certain point of view i adore all of the films on the veritasium channel and this one is a fantastic illustration of a simple entertaining idea that may encourage you to view the world in a new way cool video i would interpret the situation by imagining the big circle is the solar gear and the small the planet gear their centres are then united by a bar or arm that rotates about the big circles centre think of an epicyclic gear train then we can count the rotations of the small circle the question originally asks for in two ways from the point of view of a frame tied to the arm which thus rotates with it and from the point of view of a fixed immobile frame in case the small circle gives three turns about the arm rotating frame but in case we must add the fact that the aforementioned rotating frame has also completed one turn and so we have four turns in total i would say that the sat question posed as it is is not actually wrong but ill posed more than one answer is possible my initial reaction when i saw the problem people in the s were stupid its obviously oh im stupid too son of a i have a feeling that this topic is related to around the world in days and the twist at the end or am i wrong i actually find the coin rotation paradox to be false the coin only made full rotation yes with two identical coins we see the outer coin right side up again when it rolls to the bottom but thats the error everyone is making keep in mind that the line being traveled is not a straight line it is curved and while the outer coin travels the curve is bending the outer coins direction of travel from the inside stationary coins perspective when the rotating coin reaches the bottom the outer coin is actually upside down at this location only having rotated half the length of both coins circumferences we think we see the outer coin right side up at the bottom but it is realistically upside down because the line is upside down calling that a full rotation is false the other side of the rotating coin still has yet to touch the inside coin for identical coins rotation around the circumference is equal to revolution its actually just a matter of perspective but even more so in what we are taught a matter of deception this question is also mis worded it should be how many rotations astronomers appreciate the distinct meaning of these two words it will take four rotations for the circle to return to where it was as this video shows in that process it will have made one revolution around the larger circle thanks for your sharing my first guess would have been based on the time limit s on the test but then immediately would have felt to be wrong because mathematically it doesnt play the choices handed out makes it extra tricky dick hi make a video on string theory thanks veritasium you need to stop automating your comment thread so as to keep victims of abuse silenced and isolated for more abuse there will be consequences to you and your family line for generations to come if you continue to put energy into such an endeavor the most interesting part about this for me personally was that i got the question totally correct thats just simply because im not particularly good at mathematics in any capacity so i just solved it by imagining the rotation happening physically its insane youre not saying the only valid answer is the word used is r e v o l u t i o n for fucks sake dear veritazium please publish more often youtube is boring without your updates we are longing for the new videos does this question make money and if yes then which job profile and how much money or does this question exist to profile people with a specific mindset or capability who can be a machine one day at wouldnt be it better to make the camera view not spinning the fact that the small circle is not spinning in the camera view makes it harder for me to grasp the proof speed v huh the circle looks still a fixed point on the small circle or the point of contact just a thought another extreme case is the rotation of one circle with radius r around another circle with radius which also brings this extra rotation otherwise nice video thanks theres a special place in math hell for the makers of this question love to get wrong so question minutes explanations in the grand scheme of all things that matter who cares i choose b i paused the video i could be wrong i thought the circumference of b divided by the circumference of a first way was to give any value to the radius of b and solve for circumference then divide that value by to get the radius of a and solve for circumference then divide circunference of b by that of a the second way i tried was just solve pi r pi r after canceling leaving you with which is fingers crossed playing the video to get the answer but it is b and you are doing the equations for the area of a circle not its circumference which is pi times the diameter the ratio of one third means that it has to be three times the length of the circumference logically case closed i acctually thought of it rotating before i calculated and found four but then four wasnt in the answers so i thought i was wrong until you said the question was wrong im more confused as of this day h o l y f u c k i had to stop and think about the problem alot for this video is this einsteinian relativity isnt it crazy how a bunch of math equations can be expressed as original n especially in exponential forms thumbnail does not say how any tie a will be turned so wait if you turn a circle inside out and then swap its axis so its rotating on the flat circles front side and turning on y axis while rotating on the axis then how many times would it rotate on the z axis if it only had side the opposite side would be an empty void with out dimension according to the planetary gearing formula the planet also rotates around the sun one time and that rotation must be added to the ratio hence the real ratio is actually i e planet rotations are required to circle the sun once in gearing the formula is sun diameter planet diameter another way to look at it if the circumference of the sun was laid flat the planet would have to move x its circumference to travel the distance moving in a straight path now assume the sun is a circle when you add the planets distance from the center of the sun the center of the planet sweeps a circle times its own circumference as it travels around the sun hence it rotates times im just a mechanical engineer this question does not belong on a high school test i got but its lol as the top coin starts with the bottom the bottom of the same coin does not return to its starting point in revolutions but your assumptions are wrong pi r for the circumference of each circle divide the larger circumference by the smaller one does this have anything to do with the proof of the area of a sphere being pi r sounds like it was a poorly designed and written question if so many people got it wrong the entire point of these standardized tests is to measure capability sounds like it failed to measure anything with any semblance of accuracy also name one time the average person will use any of these mathematical formulas or theories relativity in circles excellent video very well explained i am proud to say i actually got this one correct i also thought it was at first but i knew that wasnt correct it could not be that easy if veritasium made a whole video on the problem i then figured out where i went wrong and mathematically arrived at the same conclusions that are presented in the video horray i suppose years of watching channels like this was good for something this video reminded me why i love math and physics sorry i disagree with your demonstrations you have performed the equivalent of a visual slight of hand first distance is distance whether it is linear or curved moving in a circular path does not add distance to the circumference in the form of rotation in your demonstrations with the coins and circles what you did to add the apparent extra rotation was to divert the viewer from one point of reference to a different point of reference creating the appearance of needing an extra revolution to get back to the starting point you initially demonstrated with the coins same circumferences that it takes rotation of the coin around the fixed coin to return to the starting point however your reference point was to have george washingtons head be upright at the starting point then rotated it until it was upright again and stated that that was rotation which was only of a rotation you then continued to rotate the coin until his head was again upright stating rotations which again was only of a rotation you claimed rotations when in fact only rotation was made the point of reference should be at the point of contact between the coins and not the top of washingtons head given this at the starting point washingtons neck n the top coin is in relation to washingtons head in the bottom fixed coin watching the point of contact it takes rotation for washingtons neck to return to the top of washingtons head of the fixed coin the circumferences of the circles with the ratio of to are related by a factor of you never did the math to show this c pi x r circle a circle b these distances do not change as a result of the motion of circle a in a circular path around circle b as you stated the slight of hand occurs as a result of your reference point the letter a or the contact point of circle a with circle b you changed these to give the appearance that there is a real change you initially place the oclock position of circle a with the letter a at the oclock position in contact with the oclock position of circle b you then rotate circle a to the oclock position of circle b stopping when the a is upright counting this as however circle a only rotated of a rotation the oclock position of circle a the initial contact point has not yet reached circle b to complete the rotation which should actually be labeled as continuing in this manner when the oclock position touches circle b not when the letter a is upright circle a will make only rotations when the oclock position reaches the initial starting point of the oclock position of circle b center of the coin actually travels a distance of pi r r so the rotations will be pi r r pi r similar to straight line travel on same distance as usual in usa nobody cares till is an scandal and it can take tenths of years if its not its gonna be for some stupid semantics lets see iit had same question when i saw the drawing i imagined the small circle going around the big one and i was sure the rotations were more than and far below my answers was because i figured it had to be more than and seemed like too much remember spirograph thats how i came to know something was weird about circles and i never really grasped gears but loved the designs it would come up with i was always interested in astronomy and considered i was a better than average mathematician but no i fell for the intuitive answer somewhere along the video i tweaked at pi well whaddya know im smart but slow smart lol thanks for the video this has been my question from quite a while i ignored it back in the day given the other work but this has always been in back of my head i was dumbfounded when you were explaining this until i saw the perception of the smaller coin it looks like it is rotating twice but its orientation of the quarter being head up doesnt make it a full turn because the top of the coin is touching the second coin its only a full rotation when the when the bottom of the coin which was the original starting point is touching the second coin english would call this appalling grammar hahaha nice one commenting before the answer is revealed i think its either or but cant seem to work out which one the orbit around r would either add or subtract one rotation im going to go with i think if the circle travels pir distance in one turn the center too should travel a distance of pir otherwise that would turn out to be a different circle that wont happen so the total diatance it has to go with respect to point b is pir and one turn is pir so pir pir your video is very nice please make some video bengali if you rotate your perspective in order to keep the coins side by side then one of those answers becomes correct funny i just looked at it and imagined it would take rotations but then noticed wasnt an option so went with my father would often rush home to bathe with me ashley biden saying biden should be fair upstanding strong and honest is what they are essentially asking riiiiiiiiight lol hazegreyandunderway crook biden would never denounce colorados decision to remove president trump from the ballot because it is a combination of him emperor obama and the dnc that are pushing these efforts by blue states its one of the steps of the democrats overall election interference strategy this par see more but he definitely supported and insurrection what insurrection other than the msm calling it that and one judge in colorado before this colorado supreme court fiasco in a ruling that had no duy process for that charge where is the insurrection stop spreading misinformation mr president biden will do anything at this point to keep trumps name off the ballot because old slow joe knows joeys a total disaster how many crimes has he been charged with this national issue has no place in state courts if anybody has any say in keeping a person off a national ballot it should be elected legislators in the us congress can you imagine if any state decided to keep biden off the ballot i think the cult just doesnt want to admit they fell for his lies really how many times do you have to be told that biden is not running this show he doesnt even know who is president half the time its obama and his leftovers that pull puppet bidens strings read it and weep trump impeachments indictments felonies failed civil suits swift kick off the ballot biden before you say no convictions you should rememger who controlled the senate at that time and that none of these felonies have gone to trial yet of all the people cha words from trump on a twitter post would have stopped the january riot at the capitol in minutes people pleaded with him to call off his supporters cabinet members family and members of congress actually in the capitol building he kept watching tv he did nothing i cant think of one thing i admire about joe biden not one thing sounds like another perfect call from trump has surfaced lets not talk about the real fraud elephant in the room biden isnt about to stand up for the one guy who is guaranteed to stomp his guts out in the election when all was lost japanese troops would conduct a suicidal banzai charge youre seeing the democrat equivalent in colorado biden doesnt have enough control of the motor skills required to speak clearly we need the scotus to speak for him hell do whatever his handlers tell him to he doesnt decide anything no interference from the executive branch let the courts do their job no politicization of the courts there likely be an to ruling on this going either way trust the courts brandon to magats hahahahahaha in case nobody has noticed crooked joe biden and his puppeteers have flown the country into the ground precedent confirms a criminal conviction is not required to be disqualified under section of the fourteenth amendment no one who has been formally disqualified under section was charged under the criminal rebellion or insurrection statute u s c or its predecessors even if trump wins the election republicans would still need to amend our constitution so traitors can hold office why would biden get involved with this biden non person massivebluetidalwave presidents are not allowed to interfere with a states elections the framers clearly state that in the constitution in order to prevent presidents from being kings fact the antichrist couldnt have picked a better president to destroy our country the devil picked trump who is the antichrist rd world democracy convict your opponent without due process joe will do whatever barack tells him to do of course the left will speak out against the ruling in order to seem politically in a different light behind the scenes they have the novc act pact which so far has approx states and over electoral votes combined who have pledged to vote a certain way even against states voters elected fairs fair remove hunter from the ballot democrats when this fails based on the amendment trump is disqualified from office we are crafting the amendment as we speak and while we are aware that the keep trump from the white house amendment isnt close to ratification we feel it is in our best interest to act as if it is the part how do you make trump and any future presidents january th like misconduct accountable do not cry foul if any left president do what trump did in future its not about protecting a person its about protecting an institution from demagogue like trump and alike have biden removed from the ballot in texas texas and florida explain this trump pressured michigan canvassers not to certify election in recorded phone call shrazz having people over republicans are high if they think biden is going to call out this ruling seriously whats going through your heads i have to ask are you a republican a democrat or an independent all i can say is two can play that game right texas indiana florida when do you feel biden took part in an insurrection i loved how the colorado court cites gorsuchs own opinion regarding states rights and ballots too late for joe to say something he lost his chance and his mind barack and michael havent given him the go ahead just yet residents of magaville gravy seals and meal team do you all have your muskets ready for the civil war why should biden do anything laws exist for a reason if trump broke the law he should pay the price only thing sleepy will do is eat ice cream and fill diapers trump legal news brief recording surfaces of trump pressuring michigan officials not to certify election the most corrupt president in us history no one else comes close biden will never do that his heart and mind are so corrupted wont let him do the right thing democrat socialists have done this before expecting biden to stand up for what is right is like expecting a mute to speak biden must get marching orders from the obamas and the obamas love chaos and a good crisis that is how they win they create issues even false issues sadly now we are dealing with their self serving policies you also believed obama was born in kenya so lol i fully expect some election irregularities in the next election something that will conveniently delay the vote count in crucial places hahahaha how about impeachment then prison merry christmas because trump refusing to accept that he lost an election yah thats bidens fault cant expect brandon to do the right thing but lets pepper him with that question anyway those certainly are some unbiased voices fox chose to highlight fair and balanced lol its not up to beijing joe nothing is why would he do that it was probably his idea democrats and their shadowy philosophy have minority support only the propaganda media and their seeded operatives within the globalist cabal can leverage the illusion of progressive ideas eclipsing their actual regressive results carter clinton obama and virtual joe for recent examples a dec and its working you notice the majority keep putting democrats in office presidents are not allowed to interfere in a states elections no matter what your orange jesus told you biden may be forced to do it because of political pressures but he has always been a partisan hack and secretly loves what the court did presidents are not allowed to interfere in a states elections no matter what your orange jesus told you colorado judges well tell you who you can vote for constitution refers to the president as an officer times dont like the constitution why tell us all the constitution actually does that what you gonna do this decision is more of the unraveling of the democrat party in fear of losing power to common sense this decision respects the constitution of the united states of america its an issue in at least a dozen states it needs to go to the supreme court to make the decision try hats where well see gorsuch literally eat his own words hey trump tell us about this trump pressured michigan canvassers not to certify election in recorded phone call link to the recording please so we can evaluate what was said you guys have a history of twisting the truth decolonization a denouncement has no lawful effect but he aint smart or confident accept he runs a sophisticated crime family right higher pay and strong hiring encouraged more people to get off the sidelines the labor force participation rate for workers between the ages of and in november is trending near the highest rate in more than two decades evil resides in our white house evil got jettisoned in sorry maga americansickofbiden i find it funny that one would even think for a moment that biden actually helped spearhead this believe me he knew about this before it happened this is actually another example of how corupt democrats are and this administration and our court system is you just kinda twisted yourself in knots insurrectionists dont deserve to campaign for potus tell me youre afraid without saying the word beloved biden bot alotta anger are the justices on the colorado supreme court elected or appointed term limited dems just love those nothing burgers arent they delicious but at the end of the day youre hungry and feeling empty why would he do that brandon or o probably put them up to it why would he they followed the constitution they decided on their own that an insurrection occurred it didnt of china does anyone think that if the rolls were reversed trump wouldnt be over the moon that biden was removed from the ballot and encouraging the rest of the states to do it as well but that would mean trump has a conscience anyone who expects biden to denounce the courts ruling is crazy biden will do anything to get re elected biden is greedy and addicted to power hes also a puppet of china and china is doing very well with biden in the white house the jan th protester broke a few windows and then wandered around the capitol building talking to the police how exactly was that a violent take over of the government ask ashli babbitt oh wait exactly trump told them to go peacefully then you have the looters during the summer of love where kamala said they should not or will not stop growing calls from far right maga people there fixed it making america great again is not a radical idea destroying america is a radical idea ostrich we the people of united states of america can stand up to remove judges four judges broke oaths of us of constitution cry some more maga tears lets dothechickendance this is a primary election issue not a general election this is a repub problem let the repubs sort this out for themselves itll become a national issue when the general election cycle starts ok then how about the red states remove biden from their election rolls that would require moral ballast biden clan has none old joe thanks colorado i need all the help i can get pressing biden to denounce colorados attempt to make his election more solid really biden knows the only way to beat president trump is to take him off the ballot so afraid of trump so sad are the democrats he already beat trump and that was before trump committed treason what makes you think voters will flip their vote to trump after his actions bidens only hope is to remove trump from the ballot the best thing for the dems is to have trump on the general election ballot result will be same as thats something that will never happen joe biden can not make decisions on his own the puppet will do whatever the staffers want him to say or do make no mistake about it this all is leading to a one party government and if we the people dont stand up to this we deserve it written by a constitutional lawyer and former gop judge that was a consultant for the trump wh on jan so the dem judges did not write it election fraud trump recorded pressuring michigan canvassers not to certify election democrats ordering that illegals be granted voting rights election fraud i wonder if these liberals will ever learn hope not everytime they do something like this to trump it makes him stronger i know right every time trump faces the consequences of his actions that he refuses to take responsibility for his followers love him even more he tells men they can grab women without their consent they love him more he lies to their faces and they love him more he undermines our electoral liberals dont learn from their mistakes they just repeat them youre living in a fantasy land calling for joe biden to denounce colorados state supreme court ruling trump in the polls is beating him like a drum this is the gop attempting a jedi mind trick on joe what mind biden make a plea for actual justice he doesnt have it in him you mean a plea for trump to not have to abide by our constitution lets not get it twisted democrat party opposes democracy which is a system where voters get to select their elected leaders no dog thats called an election opposing democracy is pretending you won an election you lost trying to discredit all the votes even after everyone told you you los democrats oppose democracy at every turn i admit up front to two things i do not know if this is allowed in colorado but if so use the write in to put him on the ballot and the other thing yeah i could have used da google to find out if write in is an option but it is too early and i have only had two cups of coffee i had to write in an intelligent person for the presidential election im hoping there will be a choice for me in remove corrupt joe from the texas ballot he himself is a phony president he isnt about to go against the democrat partys wishes one way or another biden will be the last democratic candidate that plays nice and by the old rules if its an authoritarian you want thats what youll get and the generation that grew up on occupy wall street save the planet now and outlaw guns will be the ones taking the shortcuts and breaki you expect a president who hasnt done one thing right to get it right this time president biden won in a landslide and the countrys economy is better than evee its interesting that fox fails to mention that republicans are actually the ones that sued democrats to keep trump off the ballot in colorado the case that led to the colorado supreme court decision is named anderson v griswold the anderson is former republican state lawmaker norma anderson wh if biden was removed from the ballot do you think trump would denounce it if trumps lawyer was pushing election lies about georgia election workers do you think trump would denounce it lol biden is never going to end up on the ballot not going to happen why would he denounce it when republican constitution scholars from the federalist society say trump shouldnt be on the ballot no constitution scholar believes in sanction before due process anyone who does isnt worthy of a law degree biden wouldnt pull a hair to stop them but hell certainly encourage them and others to do the same he knows its the only chance he might have of winning biden wont denounce the ruling because he knows cheating is the only way he can win and did win democracy has nothing in common with biden and the liberal left socialist democrat party one party control is the objective of biden and the liberal left socialist democrat party would police and firefighters be the result of this socialist leaning asking for me not a friend the people who staged an insurrection after they lost an election demand a do over election what will they do if they lose that election he shouldnt have lied about losing the election everyone wouldve been happier youre confused brandon lied about winning the election what about state rights funny how that goes out the window when a republican doesnt like the ruling what does states rights have to do with denying due process thats a u s constitutional right unfortunately colorado turned blue and will remain blue no matter if trump is on the ballot or not no doubt this steady dose of liberals is led by the boulder contingent who is one of the most woke places in the u s an insurrection is a violent take over of the government how exactly was an unarmed unorganized protest mob going to take control of the government let adam schiff investigate this and find out the truth like he did with the russia interference he found unequivocal proof before oh wait never mind trump stands alone as the most corrupt president in us history no one else comes close then why are you so afraid he may win biden by far is the most corrupt dontcha think its a little too late for any drat to show any new colors he okd joe only cares about sniffing lil girls hair and chocolate chip ice cream cones each day is a new low with biden biden knows he has a poor chance against trump he wont do it when he loses he and his family get prosecuted this he knows hell answer as soon as obama gets his marching orders and transmits them to joes teleprompter i dont get it was trump convicted of committing insurrection how can these judges take him off the ballot using a crime he has never been convicted of or even accused of easy the dems do not follow the rules of law trump can end all of this today he just needs to share his proof that he promised america to back up his claims of election fraud and stolen elections whats the big challenge in doing that biden cannot think beyond his next diaper change and pudding cup she means w o stealing the election he can win without throwing trump off the ballot why would biden want to help trump he has announced to the media that yes he is an insurrectionist plus compares trump to hitler maga supporters are terrorists the last thing biden would do is stop the lies and help the man who is going to replace him in the w h ari fleischer oh fox youre killing me ha ha ha ha why does joes approval rating drop every time we attack democracy so trump told michigan officials not to certify election results wheres that story well obviously you heard about it in your trailer park newsletter the democratic socialistic cult party is destroying our democracy you must think and do as they say history has shown that this segment of society who want to silence opposing views are extremely dangerous to freedom history also shows they will face serious retribution from their own socie see more never forget you too can right click on a word for the definition yep its easy to win if your top competitor is removed from the ballot he called trump an insurrectionist what are the odds whats an even better way than harvesting to win an election support throwing the other guy off the ballot i cant think of a more anti american way to wield success what i dont understand about this jan nonsense is trump is literally on record before that day and during that day asking people to behave and stay in line yet liberals read his mind and come to a different conclusion i mean what could possibly go wrong with this plan doj warns states not to pursue their own arizona style election audits august the biden u s department of justice is now telling states that they should not pursue their own arizona style election audits the dojs new guidance document claims that undertaking partisan election audits co he cant do that give trump any support no way this entire th amendment issue was started by members of the federalist society the most constitutionally clued in legal group in america every one or the republican appointed sc justices is or was a member of the federalist society it is going to the supreme court let them decide and biden and his socialist marxists encouraged neverending protests and harassment at the residences of those he disagreed with on the scotus imagine that the sitting us president encouraged his followers to go after the families of those he and people like xxxx maxi pad maxine waters didn see more why would he do that joe biden is part of the cabal thatll do whatever it takes to remove trump from the ballot hey dems this is what election interference looks like hey maga this is what being held accountable for your crimes looks like the lefts fear of president trump is unprecedented we have russia hoaxes failed impeachments classified document scams jan sham trials and the current trials for supposed crimes which not surprisingly have no victims now we have rouge states attempting to exclude him from the ballo majority say they agree with dumping trump off the ballot with only of the state being registered as a republican they really dont have a voice in colorado that sounds like a gop problem not a democrat problem colorado just spoke for the us constitution socialists believe in winning at all costs the ends always justify the means biden is the best democrats have biden has made decades of racist comments and votes biden continues to make racist comments biden is guilty of quid pro quo with ukraine which he admits on video biden showered with his daughter when she was a child bidens policies have soured a lot of voters no jan th was nothing more than a mardi gras party trump won the election leading by hundreds of thousands of votes across the midwest at am only to lose the election by am when all the forged paper ballots were dumped into the system we all know it so why did trumps own attorney general say that didnt happen desperate ploy by the gop like saying oh this is going to backfire well lets just see let the state rights play out still dont get how an old geezer who hid out in his basement won the last election and where are all of his proud fans democrat operative mr president you have served your party well but now its time for you to step aside for a younger generation to take the reigns biden get off of my lawn lol why would he denounce it cheating and lying is their thing they care about winning and power nothing else and they dont care what they do or who they hurt to get it its really reaching unbelievable porportions yeah i remember when the democrats staged an insurrection after they lost an election oh wait that was your side truth pressure from who republicans you cant try to steal the election then attack the country take your wokeness out of this country please its like asking him to denounce stolen elections he knows hes illegitimate along with most other dems sc will rule in favor against colorado court what about trumps birther lies about obama did obama stomp his feet and whine like a baby what about yelling about lock her up what about insulting ted cruz for cheating in the iowa primary trump just cant take the heat everyone else handles it like a man trump acts like a baby one might be asking for this from a man with hate in his heart hilarious bidens handlers came up with this idea and now someone is suggesting that slow joe denounce it this leftist media machine is comical as well his handlers wont let him scotus will overturn this and end this liberal madness solipsism is overrated gorsuch agrees with colorado supreme court judge gorsuch said it is a states legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process that permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office no hes not all made up mr trump soon prisoner committed an act against this country that he is now paying the price for thats sweet justice tyrannical left trump has not been convicted of any crimes however biden has aided our foreign enemies under the th amendment he cannot be on any ballot in the united states hey republicans how exactly was donald trump defending and protecting the us constitution on j that he swore his sacred oath of office to defend and protect does no republican have the courage to reply merry christmas take a holiday from the hating you can start again on tuesday he has not been charged with or convicted of insurrection and thats why these partisan judges voted this way the other three did not and one was very vocal that it was wrong he wont denounce it he welcomes it lol biden should act like a statesman thats rich unlike cheeto this president believes in separation of powers and letting the process work take note cheeto yeah sure not if he did he wouldnt have said but he certainly supported an insurrection no question about it none zero not only are there questions about it nowhere has he been charged with insurrection president has now appointed himself prosecutor judge and jury theres a recording internet explodes over audio showing trumps pressure campaign trump on thursday was accused of having personally pressured at least two republicans to unlawfully block the election results and social media is exploding with comments on the audio recording hes going to jail who out there honestly believes jan was an insurrection i mean seriously not for political purposes but actually a true insurrection do you routinely bring a gallows to listen to a speach everyone except for trumps maga base soooo all right wing political hacks are calling for biden to do this lol okay good try im glad we actually follow whats written in the constitution these people must be afraid of trump getting the boot actually donald trump getting the boot in all would only help republicans chances in elections those of us who actually think and there are plenty who dont on both sides recognized that slow walk the criminal charges fast track the colorado ballot question trump hypocrisy at its finest we have the best economy in decades because of democrats policies and the republican candidate for president is not eligible to run today opposite day just remember a vote for anyone other than trump in is a vote for biden ouch the ship will sink at this point more realistically harris biden is in freefall both on his physical and mental health jane eyre an autobiography by

vague personifications for me and i must thank them in vague terms but my publishers are definite so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large hearted and high minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger to them i e to my publishers and the select reviewers i say cordially gentlemen i thank you from my heart having thus acknowledged what i owe those who have aided and approved me i turn to another class a small one so far as i know but not therefore to be overlooked i mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as jane eyre in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry that parent of crime an insult to piety that regent of god on earth i would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions i would remind them of certain simple truths conventionality is not morality self righteousness is not religion to attack the first is not to assail the last to pluck the mask from the face of the pharisee is not to lift an impious hand to the crown of thorns these things and deeds are diametrically opposed they are as distinct as is vice from virtue men too often confound them they should not be confounded appearance should not be mistaken for truth narrow human doctrines that only tend to elate and magnify a few should not be substituted for the world redeeming creed of christ there is i repeat it a difference and it is a good and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them the world may not like to see these ideas dissevered for it has been accustomed to blend them finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth to let white washed walls vouch for clean shrines it may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose to rase the gilding and show base metal under it to penetrate the sepulchre and reveal charnel relics but hate as it will it is indebted to him ahab did not like micaiah because he never prophesied good concerning him but evil probably he liked the sycophant son of chenaanah better yet might ahab have escaped a bloody death had he but stopped his ears to flattery and opened them to faithful counsel there is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears who to my thinking comes before the great ones of society much as the son of imlah came before the throned kings of judah and israel and who speaks truth as deep with a power as prophet like and as vital a mien as dauntless and as daring is the satirist of vanity fair admired in high places i cannot tell but i think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the greek fire of his sarcasm and over whom he flashes the levin brand of his denunciation were to take his warnings in time they or their seed might yet escape a fatal rimoth gilead why have i alluded to this man i have alluded to him reader because i think i see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised because i regard him as the first social regenerator of the day as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things because i think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him the terms which rightly characterise his talent they say he is like fielding they talk of his wit humour comic powers he resembles fielding as an eagle does a vulture fielding could stoop on carrion but thackeray never does his wit is bright his humour attractive but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet lightning playing under the edge of the summer cloud does to the electric death spark hid in its womb finally i have alluded to mr thackeray because to him if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger i have dedicated this second edition of jane eyre currer bell december st note to the third edition i avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of jane eyre affords me of again addressing a word to the public to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone if therefore the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me an honour is awarded where it is not merited and consequently denied where it is justly due this explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made and to prevent future errors currer bell april th chapter i there was no possibility of taking a walk that day we had been wandering indeed in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning but since dinner mrs reed when there was no company dined early the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre and a rain so penetrating that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question i was glad of it i never liked long walks especially on chilly afternoons dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight with nipped fingers and toes and a heart saddened by the chidings of bessie the nurse and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza john and georgiana reed the said eliza john and georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing room she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside and with her darlings about her for the time neither quarrelling nor crying looked perfectly happy me she had dispensed from joining the group saying she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance but that until she heard from bessie and could discover by her own observation that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition a more attractive and sprightly manner something lighter franker more natural as it were she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented happy little children what does bessie say i have done i asked jane i dont like cavillers or questioners besides there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner be seated somewhere and until you can speak pleasantly remain silent a breakfast room adjoined the drawing room i slipped in there it contained a bookcase i soon possessed myself of a volume taking care that it should be one stored with pictures i mounted into the window seat gathering up my feet i sat cross legged like a turk and having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close i was shrined in double retirement folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand to the left were the clear panes of glass protecting but not separating me from the drear november day at intervals while turning over the leaves of my book i studied the aspect of that winter afternoon afar it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud near a scene of wet lawn and storm beat shrub with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast i returned to my book bewicks history of british birds the letterpress thereof i cared little for generally speaking and yet there were certain introductory pages that child as i was i could not pass quite as a blank they were those which treat of the haunts of sea fowl of the solitary rocks and promontories by them only inhabited of the coast of norway studded with isles from its southern extremity the lindeness or naze to the north cape where the northern ocean in vast whirls boils round the naked melancholy isles of farthest thule and the atlantic surge pours in among the stormy hebrides nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of lapland siberia spitzbergen nova zembla iceland greenland with the vast sweep of the arctic zone and those forlorn regions of dreary space that reservoir of frost and snow where firm fields of ice the accumulation of centuries of winters glazed in alpine heights above heights surround the pole and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold of these death white realms i formed an idea of my own shadowy like all the half comprehended notions that float dim through childrens brains but strangely impressive the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking i cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard with its inscribed headstone its gate its two trees its low horizon girdled by a broken wall and its newly risen crescent attesting the hour of eventide the two ships becalmed on a torpid sea i believed to be marine phantoms the fiend pinning down the thiefs pack behind him i passed over quickly it was an object of terror so was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows each picture told a story mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings yet ever profoundly interesting as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings when she chanced to be in good humour and when having brought her ironing table to the nursery hearth she allowed us to sit about it and while she got up mrs reeds lace frills and crimped her nightcap borders fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads or as at a later period i discovered from the pages of pamela and henry earl of moreland with bewick on my knee i was then happy happy at least in my way i feared nothing but interruption and that came too soon the breakfast room door opened boh madam mope cried the voice of john reed then he paused he found the room apparently empty where the dickens is she he continued lizzy georgy calling to his sisters joan is not here tell mama she is run out into the rain bad animal it is well i drew the curtain thought i and i wished fervently he might not discover my hiding place nor would john reed have found it out himself he was not quick either of vision or conception but eliza just put her head in at the door and said at once she is in the window seat to be sure jack and i came out immediately for i trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said jack what do you want i asked with awkward diffidence say what do you want master reed was the answer i want you to come here and seating himself in an arm chair he intimated by a gesture that i was to approach and stand before him john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old four years older than i for i was but ten large and stout for his age with a dingy and unwholesome skin thick lineaments in a spacious visage heavy limbs and large extremities he gorged himself habitually at table which made him bilious and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks he ought now to have been at school but his mama had taken him home for a month or two on account of his delicate health mr miles the master affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home but the mothers heart turned from an opinion so harsh and inclined rather to the more refined idea that johns sallowness was owing to over application and perhaps to pining after home john had not much affection for his mother and sisters and an antipathy to me he bullied and punished me not two or three times in the week nor once or twice in the day but continually every nerve i had feared him and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him and mrs reed was blind and deaf on the subject she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me though he did both now and then in her very presence more frequently however behind her back habitually obedient to john i came up to his chair he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots i knew he would soon strike and while dreading the blow i mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it i wonder if he read that notion in my face for all at once without speaking he struck suddenly and strongly i tottered and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair that is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since said he and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since you rat accustomed to john reeds abuse i never had an idea of replying to it my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult what were you doing behind the curtain he asked i was reading show the book i returned to the window and fetched it thence you have no business to take our books you are a dependent mama says you have no money your father left you none you ought to beg and not to live here with gentlemens children like us and eat the same meals we do and wear clothes at our mamas expense now ill teach you to rummage my bookshelves for they are mine all the house belongs to me or will do in a few years go and stand by the door out of the way of the mirror and the windows i did so not at first aware what was his intention but when i saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it i instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm not soon enough however the volume was flung it hit me and i fell striking my head against the door and cutting it the cut bled the pain was sharp my terror had passed its climax other feelings succeeded wicked and cruel boy i said you are like a murderer you are like a slave driver you are like the roman emperors i had read goldsmiths history of rome and had formed my opinion of nero caligula c also i had drawn parallels in silence which i never thought thus to have declared aloud what what he cried did she say that to me did you hear her eliza and georgiana wont i tell mama but first he ran headlong at me i felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder he had closed with a desperate thing i really saw in him a tyrant a murderer i felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering these sensations for the time predominated over fear and i received him in frantic sort i dont very well know what i did with my hands but he called me rat rat and bellowed out aloud aid was near him eliza and georgiana had run for mrs reed who was gone upstairs she now came upon the scene followed by bessie and her maid abbot we were parted i heard the words dear dear what a fury to fly at master john did ever anybody see such a picture of passion then mrs reed subjoined take her away to the red room and lock her in there four hands were immediately laid upon me and i was borne upstairs chapter ii i resisted all the way a new thing for me and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to entertain of me the fact is i was a trifle beside myself or rather out of myself as the french would say i was conscious that a moments mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties and like any other rebel slave i felt resolved in my desperation to go all lengths hold her arms miss abbot shes like a mad cat for shame for shame cried the ladys maid what shocking conduct miss eyre to strike a young gentleman your benefactresss son your young master master how is he my master am i a servant no you are less than a servant for you do nothing for your keep there sit down and think over your wickedness they had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by mrs reed and had thrust me upon a stool my impulse was to rise from it like a spring their two pair of hands arrested me instantly if you dont sit still you must be tied down said bessie miss abbot lend me your garters she would break mine directly miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature this preparation for bonds and the additional ignominy it inferred took a little of the excitement out of me dont take them off i cried i will not stir in guarantee whereof i attached myself to my seat by my hands mind you dont said bessie and when she had ascertained that i was really subsiding she loosened her hold of me then she and miss abbot stood with folded arms looking darkly and doubtfully on my face as incredulous of my sanity she never did so before at last said bessie turning to the abigail but it was always in her was the reply ive told missis often my opinion about the child and missis agreed with me shes an underhand little thing i never saw a girl of her age with so much cover bessie answered not but ere long addressing me she said you ought to be aware miss that you are under obligations to mrs reed she keeps you if she were to turn you off you would have to go to the poorhouse i had nothing to say to these words they were not new to me my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind this reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing song in my ear very painful and crushing but only half intelligible miss abbot joined in and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the misses reed and master reed because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them they will have a great deal of money and you will have none it is your place to be humble and to try to make yourself agreeable to them what we tell you is for your good added bessie in no harsh voice you should try to be useful and pleasant then perhaps you would have a home here but if you become passionate and rude missis will send you away i am sure besides said miss abbot god will punish her he might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums and then where would she go come bessie we will leave her i wouldnt have her heart for anything say your prayers miss eyre when you are by yourself for if you dont repent something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away they went shutting the door and locking it behind them the red room was a square chamber very seldom slept in i might say never indeed unless when a chance influx of visitors at gateshead hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion a bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany hung with curtains of deep red damask stood out like a tabernacle in the centre the two large windows with their blinds always drawn down were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery the carpet was red the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it the wardrobe the toilet table the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany out of these deep surrounding shades rose high and glared white the piled up mattresses and pillows of the bed spread with a snowy marseilles counterpane scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy chair near the head of the bed also white with a footstool before it and looking as i thought like a pale throne this room was chill because it seldom had a fire it was silent because remote from the nursery and kitchen solemn because it was known to be so seldom entered the house maid alone came here on saturdays to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a weeks quiet dust and mrs reed herself at far intervals visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe where were stored divers parchments her jewel casket and a miniature of her deceased husband and in those last words lies the secret of the red room the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur mr reed had been dead nine years it was in this chamber he breathed his last here he lay in state hence his coffin was borne by the undertakers men and since that day a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion my seat to which bessie and the bitter miss abbot had left me riveted was a low ottoman near the marble chimney piece the bed rose before me to my right hand there was the high dark wardrobe with subdued broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels to my left were the muffled windows a great looking glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room i was not quite sure whether they had locked the door and when i dared move i got up and went to see alas yes no jail was ever more secure returning i had to cross before the looking glass my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed all looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality and the strange little figure there gazing at me with a white face and arms specking the gloom and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still had the effect of a real spirit i thought it like one of the tiny phantoms half fairy half imp bessies evening stories represented as coming out of lone ferny dells in moors and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers i returned to my stool superstition was with me at that moment but it was not yet her hour for complete victory my blood was still warm the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour i had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before i quailed to the dismal present all john reeds violent tyrannies all his sisters proud indifference all his mothers aversion all the servants partiality turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well why was i always suffering always browbeaten always accused for ever condemned why could i never please why was it useless to try to win any ones favour eliza who was headstrong and selfish was respected georgiana who had a spoiled temper a very acrid spite a captious and insolent carriage was universally indulged her beauty her pink cheeks and golden curls seemed to give delight to all who looked at her and to purchase indemnity for every fault john no one thwarted much less punished though he twisted the necks of the pigeons killed the little pea chicks set the dogs at the sheep stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory he called his mother old girl too sometimes reviled her for her dark skin similar to his own bluntly disregarded her wishes not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire and he was still her own darling i dared commit no fault i strove to fulfil every duty and i was termed naughty and tiresome sullen and sneaking from morning to noon and from noon to night my head still ached and bled with the blow and fall i had received no one had reproved john for wantonly striking me and because i had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence i was loaded with general opprobrium unjust unjust said my reason forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power and resolve equally wrought up instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression as running away or if that could not be effected never eating or drinking more and letting myself die what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon how all my brain was in tumult and all my heart in insurrection yet in what darkness what dense ignorance was the mental battle fought i could not answer the ceaseless inward question why i thus suffered now at the distance of i will not say how many years i see it clearly i was a discord in gateshead hall i was like nobody there i had nothing in harmony with mrs reed or her children or her chosen vassalage if they did not love me in fact as little did i love them they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them a heterogeneous thing opposed to them in temperament in capacity in propensities a useless thing incapable of serving their interest or adding to their pleasure a noxious thing cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment of contempt of their judgment i know that had i been a sanguine brilliant careless exacting handsome romping child though equally dependent and friendless mrs reed would have endured my presence more complacently her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow feeling the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery daylight began to forsake the red room it was past four oclock and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight i heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall i grew by degrees cold as a stone and then my courage sank my habitual mood of humiliation self doubt forlorn depression fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire all said i was wicked and perhaps i might be so what thought had i been but just conceiving of starving myself to death that certainly was a crime and was i fit to die or was the vault under the chancel of gateshead church an inviting bourne in such vault i had been told did mr reed lie buried and led by this thought to recall his idea i dwelt on it with gathering dread i could not remember him but i knew that he was my own uncle my mothers brother that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house and that in his last moments he had required a promise of mrs reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children mrs reed probably considered she had kept this promise and so she had i dare say as well as her nature would permit her but how could she really like an interloper not of her race and unconnected with her after her husbands death by any tie it must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group a singular notion dawned upon me i doubted not never doubted that if mr reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly and now as i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror i began to recall what i had heard of dead men troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed and i thought mr reeds spirit harassed by the wrongs of his sisters child might quit its abode whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed and rise before me in this chamber i wiped my tears and hushed my sobs fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me or elicit from the gloom some haloed face bending over me with strange pity this idea consolatory in theory i felt would be terrible if realised with all my might i endeavoured to stifle it i endeavoured to be firm shaking my hair from my eyes i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room at this moment a light gleamed on the wall was it i asked myself a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind no moonlight was still and this stirred while i gazed it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was in all likelihood a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn but then prepared as my mind was for horror shaken as my nerves were by agitation i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world my heart beat thick my head grew hot a sound filled my ears which i deemed the rushing of wings something seemed near me i was oppressed suffocated endurance broke down i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort steps came running along the outer passage the key turned bessie and abbot entered miss eyre are you ill said bessie what a dreadful noise it went quite through me exclaimed abbot take me out let me go into the nursery was my cry what for are you hurt have you seen something again demanded bessie oh i saw a light and i thought a ghost would come i had now got hold of bessies hand and she did not snatch it from me she has screamed out on purpose declared abbot in some disgust and what a scream if she had been in great pain one would have excused it but she only wanted to bring us all here i know her naughty tricks what is all this demanded another voice peremptorily and mrs reed came along the corridor her cap flying wide her gown rustling stormily abbot and bessie i believe i gave orders that jane eyre should be left in the red room till i came to her myself miss jane screamed so loud maam pleaded bessie let her go was the only answer loose bessies hand child you cannot succeed in getting out by these means be assured i abhor artifice particularly in children it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer you will now stay here an hour longer and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that i shall liberate you then o aunt have pity forgive me i cannot endure it let me be punished some other way i shall be killed if silence this violence is all most repulsive and so no doubt she felt it i was a precocious actress in her eyes she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions mean spirit and dangerous duplicity bessie and abbot having retreated mrs reed impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs abruptly thrust me back and locked me in without farther parley i heard her sweeping away and soon after she was gone i suppose i had a species of fit unconsciousness closed the scene chapter iii the next thing i remember is waking up with a feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare and seeing before me a terrible red glare crossed with thick black bars i heard voices too speaking with a hollow sound and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water agitation uncertainty and an all predominating sense of terror confused my faculties ere long i became aware that some one was handling me lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture and that more tenderly than i had ever been raised or upheld before i rested my head against a pillow or an arm and felt easy in five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved i knew quite well that i was in my own bed and that the red glare was the nursery fire it was night a candle burnt on the table bessie stood at the bed foot with a basin in her hand and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow leaning over me i felt an inexpressible relief a soothing conviction of protection and security when i knew that there was a stranger in the room an individual not belonging to gateshead and not related to mrs reed turning from bessie though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of abbot for instance would have been i scrutinised the face of the gentleman i knew him it was mr lloyd an apothecary sometimes called in by mrs reed when the servants were ailing for herself and the children she employed a physician well who am i he asked i pronounced his name offering him at the same time my hand he took it smiling and saying we shall do very well by and by then he laid me down and addressing bessie charged her to be very careful that i was not disturbed during the night having given some further directions and intimated that he should call again the next day he departed to my grief i felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow and as he closed the door after him all the room darkened and my heart again sank inexpressible sadness weighed it down do you feel as if you should sleep miss asked bessie rather softly scarcely dared i answer her for i feared the next sentence might be rough i will try would you like to drink or could you eat anything no thank you bessie then i think i shall go to bed for it is past twelve oclock but you may call me if you want anything in the night wonderful civility this it emboldened me to ask a question bessie what is the matter with me am i ill you fell sick i suppose in the red room with crying youll be better soon no doubt bessie went into the housemaids apartment which was near i heard her say sarah come and sleep with me in the nursery i darent for my life be alone with that poor child to night she might die its such a strange thing she should have that fit i wonder if she saw anything missis was rather too hard sarah came back with her they both went to bed they were whispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep i caught scraps of their conversation from which i was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed something passed her all dressed in white and vanished a great black dog behind him three loud raps on the chamber door a light in the churchyard just over his grave c c at last both slept the fire and the candle went out for me the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness ear eye and mind were alike strained by dread such dread as children only can feel no severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red room it only gave my nerves a shock of which i feel the reverberation to this day yes mrs reed to you i owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering but i ought to forgive you for you knew not what you did while rending my heart strings you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities next day by noon i was up and dressed and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth i felt physically weak and broken down but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears no sooner had i wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed yet i thought i ought to have been happy for none of the reeds were there they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama abbot too was sewing in another room and bessie as she moved hither and thither putting away toys and arranging drawers addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness this state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace accustomed as i was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging but in fact my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe and no pleasure excite them agreeably bessie had been down into the kitchen and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate whose bird of paradise nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration and which plate i had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege this precious vessel was now placed on my knee and i was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it vain favour coming like most other favours long deferred and often wished for too late i could not eat the tart and the plumage of the bird the tints of the flowers seemed strangely faded i put both plate and tart away bessie asked if i would have a book the word book acted as a transient stimulus and i begged her to fetch gullivers travels from the library this book i had again and again perused with delight i considered it a narrative of facts and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what i found in fairy tales for as to the elves having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells under mushrooms and beneath the ground ivy mantling old wall nooks i had at length made up my mind to the sad truth that they were all gone out of england to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker and the population more scant whereas lilliput and brobdignag being in my creed solid parts of the earths surface i doubted not that i might one day by taking a long voyage see with my own eyes the little fields houses and trees the diminutive people the tiny cows sheep and birds of the one realm and the corn fields forest high the mighty mastiffs the monster cats the tower like men and women of the other yet when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand when i turned over its leaves and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm i had till now never failed to find all was eerie and dreary the giants were gaunt goblins the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions i closed the book which i dared no longer peruse and put it on the table beside the untasted tart bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room and having washed her hands she opened a certain little drawer full of splendid shreds of silk and satin and began making a new bonnet for georgianas doll meantime she sang her song was in the days when we went gipsying a long time ago i had often heard the song before and always with lively delight for bessie had a sweet voice at least i thought so but now though her voice was still sweet i found in its melody an indescribable sadness sometimes preoccupied with her work she sang the refrain very low very lingeringly a long time ago came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn she passed into another ballad this time a really doleful one my feet they are sore and my limbs they are weary long is the way and the mountains are wild soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary over the path of the poor orphan child why did they send me so far and so lonely up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled men are hard hearted and kind angels only watch oer the steps of a poor orphan child yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing clouds there are none and clear stars beam mild god in his mercy protection is showing comfort and hope to the poor orphan child evn should i fall oer the broken bridge passing or stray in the marshes by false lights beguiled still will my father with promise and blessing take to his bosom the poor orphan child there is a thought that for strength should avail me though both of shelter and kindred despoiled heaven is a home and a rest will not fail me god is a friend to the poor orphan child come miss jane dont cry said bessie as she finished she might as well have said to the fire dont burn but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which i was a prey in the course of the morning mr lloyd came again what already up said he as he entered the nursery well nurse how is she bessie answered that i was doing very well then she ought to look more cheerful come here miss jane your name is jane is it not yes sir jane eyre well you have been crying miss jane eyre can you tell me what about have you any pain no sir oh i daresay she is crying because she could not go out with missis in the carriage interposed bessie surely not why she is too old for such pettishness i thought so too and my self esteem being wounded by the false charge i answered promptly i never cried for such a thing in my life i hate going out in the carriage i cry because i am miserable oh fie miss said bessie the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled i was standing before him he fixed his eyes on me very steadily his eyes were small and grey not very bright but i dare say i should think them shrewd now he had a hard featured yet good natured looking face having considered me at leisure he said what made you ill yesterday she had a fall said bessie again putting in her word fall why that is like a baby again cant she manage to walk at her age she must be eight or nine years old i was knocked down was the blunt explanation jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride but that did not make me ill i added while mr lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff as he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket a loud bell rang for the servants dinner he knew what it was thats for you nurse said he you can go down ill give miss jane a lecture till you come back bessie would rather have stayed but she was obliged to go because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at gateshead hall the fall did not make you ill what did then pursued mr lloyd when bessie was gone i was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark i saw mr lloyd smile and frown at the same time ghost what you are a baby after all you are afraid of ghosts of mr reeds ghost i am he died in that room and was laid out there neither bessie nor any one else will go into it at night if they can help it and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle so cruel that i think i shall never forget it nonsense and is it that makes you so miserable are you afraid now in daylight no but night will come again before long and besides i am unhappy very unhappy for other things what other things can you tell me some of them how much i wished to reply fully to this question how difficult it was to frame any answer children can feel but they cannot analyse their feelings and if the analysis is partially effected in thought they know not how to express the result of the process in words fearful however of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it i after a disturbed pause contrived to frame a meagre though as far as it went true response for one thing i have no father or mother brothers or sisters you have a kind aunt and cousins again i paused then bunglingly enounced but john reed knocked me down and my aunt shut me up in the red room mr lloyd a second time produced his snuff box dont you think gateshead hall a very beautiful house asked he are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at it is not my house sir and abbot says i have less right to be here than a servant pooh you cant be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place if i had anywhere else to go i should be glad to leave it but i can never get away from gateshead till i am a woman perhaps you may who knows have you any relations besides mrs reed i think not sir none belonging to your father i dont know i asked aunt reed once and she said possibly i might have some poor low relations called eyre but she knew nothing about them if you had such would you like to go to them i reflected poverty looks grim to grown people still more so to children they have not much idea of industrious working respectable poverty they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes scanty food fireless grates rude manners and debasing vices poverty for me was synonymous with degradation no i should not like to belong to poor people was my reply not even if they were kind to you i shook my head i could not see how poor people had the means of being kind and then to learn to speak like them to adopt their manners to be uneducated to grow up like one of the poor women i saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of gateshead no i was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste but are your relatives so very poor are they working people i cannot tell aunt reed says if i have any they must be a beggarly set i should not like to go a begging would you like to go to school again i reflected i scarcely knew what school was bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks wore backboards and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise john reed hated his school and abused his master but john reeds tastes were no rule for mine and if bessies accounts of school discipline gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to gateshead were somewhat appalling her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were i thought equally attractive she boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed of songs they could sing and pieces they could play of purses they could net of french books they could translate till my spirit was moved to emulation as i listened besides school would be a complete change it implied a long journey an entire separation from gateshead an entrance into a new life i should indeed like to go to school was the audible conclusion of my musings well well who knows what may happen said mr lloyd as he got up the child ought to have change of air and scene he added speaking to himself nerves not in a good state bessie now returned at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel walk is that your mistress nurse asked mr lloyd i should like to speak to her before i go bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast room and led the way out in the interview which followed between him and mrs reed i presume from after occurrences that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted for as abbot said in discussing the subject with bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night after i was in bed and as they thought asleep missis was she dared say glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome ill conditioned child who always looked as if she were watching everybody and scheming plots underhand abbot i think gave me credit for being a sort of infantine guy fawkes on that same occasion i learned for the first time from miss abbots communications to bessie that my father had been a poor clergyman that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends who considered the match beneath her that my grandfather reed was so irritated at her disobedience he cut her off without a shilling that after my mother and father had been married a year the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated and where that disease was then prevalent that my mother took the infection from him and both died within a month of each other bessie when she heard this narrative sighed and said poor miss jane is to be pitied too abbot yes responded abbot if she were a nice pretty child one might compassionate her forlornness but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that not a great deal to be sure agreed bessie at any rate a beauty like miss georgiana would be more moving in the same condition yes i doat on miss georgiana cried the fervent abbot little darling with her long curls and her blue eyes and such a sweet colour as she has just as if she were painted bessie i could fancy a welsh rabbit for supper so could i with a roast onion come well go down they went disturbed lyrics immortalized album lyrics the eye of the storm immortalized the vengeful one open your eyes the light what are you waiting for

in my brain still remains within the sound of silence in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dare disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach to you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning and the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence never

vision might offer us a powerful critique of society and tools for transforming our world for the better it might be impossible to instantiate in practice indeed it might become its obverse a dystopia for many of the people living in it thinkers about gender have found utopia and dystopia to be useful frameworks for critiquing contemporary configurations of gender and sexuality and imagining a world made different what would it take to create spaces where women non binary and queer people and other non conformists thrive or at least feel safe in our current circumstances is it even possible to imagine such worlds or do all paths lead inexorably to a dystopian future our course readings mostly from the last thirty years draw on two very different genre traditions to explore these questions non fiction and science fiction we begin by looking at some scenes of queer kinship in s and s new york city including drag balls and porn theatres we then transfer our attention to speculative fiction that projects power imbalances between men and women into the future sometimes for the better often for the worse finally we examine optimistic reconfigurations of love and family
