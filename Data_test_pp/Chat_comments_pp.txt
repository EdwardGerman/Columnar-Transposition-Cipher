ive seen this migrant issue elsewhere hmm lloydmporter this is called good policing you tool if youd not shared a shortened version of the video youd know they safely disarmed and restrained the man without anyone getting hurt thats how it should be done thats called restraint it requires discipline your a migrant in palestine and stole the land so whats your point conrad hannon its like in

sucks they should dropped a moab bunker buster on the entire neighborhood huh cardioid for equal radii and an epicycloid for unequal radii otherwise it is all quite good but consider a pair of meshing gearwheels with one of three times the diameter of the other the big one will have three times as many teeth as the small one and for each one if its revolutions the smaller gearwheel will rotate three times not four oh what fun great video just came to watched this video looking at a maths problem didnt have any idea it would also explain the concept of sidereal day which i havent ever understood till today your videos are concise yet fully understandable there is a much easier way to see this thought they would hit it in the video but they did not apparently do not roll the circle a this will make it much easier to see what happens and why take a with a fixed point on the edge attach that point to a straight line the length of b circumference slide the point on a along the straight line b a does not rotate now curve the straight line b back around into the circle b again slide the single point on a along the now circular b circumference the curvature of b rotates a once as you go around the degrees of this rotation come entirely from the curvature of b swinging a around not from a rolling then a of course has its three rolls when you do roll a on b others have said similar things but you really need to fix the point on a and not roll the circle then compare the straight b vs the circled b to really understand the difference correctly this problem is actually far more complicated than most reply which have commented here if we only calculate that the center of the circle of small coins travels four times the radius then we only need to travel four times in fact many logical problems are ignored wikipedias description of this problem includes a picture of a colorful circle which clearly shows that if the circumference is divided into parts each of which is degrees the circumference of the small coin has indeed only traveled three times not four but why does the experiment appear to be four circles the reason is three circles is relative to the circumference of the small coin four circles is relative to the the center of the small coin circumference of the small coin travelled circles centre of the small coin travelled circles just shrink the coins head to infinitesimal size and use the concept of differentiation to understand the direction of the head can represent the direction of the centre of the small coin but why do the circumference travelled and the center travelled have different values the reason is that the distance traveled by the center of the circle is longer in this problem when the circumference travels three times the center needs to travel four times of circumference therefore at the same time the center of the circle moves four times and the circumference moves three times their speeds are fundamentally different but why can the same coin accommodate these different speeds the reason is that even if they belong to the same solid body the center and circumference of the circle are on different movement curves but the coin is a concrete material why the times of centre rotated is different from the circumference rotated it is the most difficult part of this question isnt this a problem of perspective people who see the outer circle making one additional revolution are being fooled by perspective in your study it is the only way to see the additional revolution when there are two ways of proving the original answer in the end given the ambiguity of the question itself the scorers should have simply agreed that both answers would be marked as correct despite there really only being one answer i actually got the correct answer when considering it for a minute in my mind but then saw that it wasnt an option so i thought i must have gotten something wrong and then also chose the curse of my life not trusting in my own abilities enough always thinking the mistake must lie with me first edit and i actually intuited the exact same correct explanation in my mind with times circumference going around the circle but still thought i must be wrong when not presented with the right choice aggravating so probably about everyone got their point out of the question because answer b was deemed correct i was biased w the title so after reaching an initial answer of in few seconds i thought about it and decided to make the shapes triangles since i couldnt track the rotation in my mind without drawing it then i realized theres more angle to cover deg to reset the position of start w angles there would be one more but i got real confused cause there were no option w as the answer as jee aspirant i got planet orange purple ring i believe every problem should be simplified the outer circle rotates around the center of the inner circle therefore the amount of revolutions is equal to the sum of the radii of both circles probably at least half of my time during school tests was spent figuring out which answers did the teachers expect instead of the right one the amount of ambiguity and assumptions was staggering great video sir please keep up the good work cad thanks answer pid pid or pi pi or b havent watched it yet its and now how did i do without watching the video i saw them as gears so thought i thought from the available answers but i felt it was wrong for some reason i immediately thought because of the wording its funny how only students out of thousands who took the test found the error yet in this chat many people claimed to find the screw up i guess were just smarter than your s kids either that or were more full of it as we type utter bs on youtube videos certainly heres a refined version of your text i found myself captivated by the video requiring multiple viewings to fully grasp its mesmerizing effect however upon closer inspection a subtle flaw emerged initially escaping my notice when the coin was set into motion the top of the head aligned with the top but as the rotation progressed halfway the section that initially made contact at the top now lacked any connection its a testament to the power of perception standing on the opposite side of the table turning in tandem with the coin transforms the head into an upside down perspective a marked bottom revealed that it never quite returned to its original contact point at the bottom even though during the flat run a portion of the head seemed to make contact upside down wrapping the straight around the main coin clarified that the upside down head was in fact facing upward this illusion extends to the cardboard cut out as well the rotation seemingly stops just when the a becomes legible but a simple test involving a marked starting point with a pen reveals that the circle needs to turn further to re establish the same contact point its a fascinating illusion showcasing the intricate interplay of visual perception please do it again by marking a start point the fact that i actually thought immediatly that its my thought proces didnt include the rotation paradox but i imagined it in my head going around portuguese dubs cool whelp i took the sat and i got it wrong i used to think i was good at math lol there are regions in the us where the sat was never expected instead the act was i tried to figure out how many times the small circle would rotate to get the answer and i thought it was around i thought the answer was therefore as that was the closest to my estimate turns out my intuition lined up with what the actual answer was being an amateur astronomer i also had heard the term sidereal as you can enter that into your telescope as certain settings never heard a good explanation for what that meant loved this video maths problems on uk test papers are normally deliberately and obviously not too scale to ensure students do the maths to find the answer and dont measure the diagram source ive looked at several gcse past papers recently scam ads yep i picked another great example of how reality diverges from our intuition what is ur email i want to send you my ideas i paused the video my answer is but when the point the circumference moves its does not move in a straight line so my the sense tell me its why isnt the answer as simple as the initial intersection point touches the big circle three times in one circumnavigation so the answer is plus for the circumnavigation equals itll give you minutes back in your life stopped to try and think the question seems like it should be times due to radius difference plus one more due to the full rotation of the point of contact to circle b interested to see how far off the answer really is i found his explanation very intriguing i think he would be a great teacher this was also a lot of fun to watch how could some people peoples score go down by throwing a question out do the remaining questions now carry slightly more point value so a wrong answer is now more negative consider the students who failed the test by point as soon as i saw the question i thought the answer was but it turned out to be much more very interesting video if they had asked the question to milling machine operators they would have get the correct answer calculating toolpaths is done in this branch on a daily basis and they would have said plus one diameter of the tool on the outside of the contour and minus one diameter of the tool on the inside of the contour everyone keeps using the word rotation the question asks how many revolutions it will take to get to the starting point my answer is oh wow my dumb dumb butt guess of was actually right i just imagined circle is degrees and cut into pieces for the size of that smaller coin kind of like in the video you have minute per question its multiple choice for a reason you dont need to do a full interpretation of the wording or show your work you can justify just select and move on theres no time to waste people get screwed over because of their perfectionism and wasting more time on this than it was worth turned out it was worth it sucks but that should your strategy be if you have doubts and spare time at the end you can always go back to the question we had the same test question in middle school but with two equal sized coins most classmates got it wrong and i dont think anyone understood the math teachers explanation afterwards we just had to accept and memorize the answer after trying it out with real coins ahhh that circle moving inside the larger circle should be spinning the other way men sacrificed their hairline in pursuit of knowledge i know i am asian but it was stupidly easy i got in like a second if you grow a to be the same perimeter as b then n xpixr xpixr is the equation to solve i was so confused i found different ways of calculating it both for an answer of but wasnt in the options so i spent a good minutes trying to figure out what i did wrong and how to get a different idea i was about to pick because its the closest option wow great video you have a good enough mathematics intuition for studying mathematics yet youre technically wrong lol got that right on first try being completely honest had a pi component left but realized that distance covered by a circle in one revolution is pi r and not r p dont know much about formulas to calculate the rotations the way they did but i could see the rotations in my mind and was confused with the answers provided thought i must be mistaken somehow but when they said hilarious interesting video this is a great example of read the question which i am always telling my students the last line says how many revolutions of circle a will the center of circle first reach its starting point so as pointed out if you take the ratio of the distance travelled by the centre of the circle over the circumference of the smaller wheel you get irrespective of what is happening at the edge of the circle it seems to me that instead of throwing that question out they should have just given all test takers credit for that question throwing it out altogether does seem somewhat unfair for the test writers error i love the little not to scale in showing the earth rotating around the sun lol i came up with cuz it looked like itd go around times opened the video saw it was multiple choice chose cuz thats the closest to my original answer and was pretty surprised when i turned out to be right im glad i wasnt stupid when i heard revolves and thought obviously it is it takes one revolution around circle b to get to the starting point that is literally the definition of revolution the correct answer is explanation starts at mark i stopped the video at and now we will see how much of an idiot i am i know the circumference of a circle is r so the large circle should have a circumference of about and the smaller circle is about so it should be revolutions now ill watch the video to be told why i am wrong obviously i must be wrong or lots of people would not have missed the question i dont think this is always the case but for this example i also noticed that the initial contact point between circle a and circle b is degrees away from the location of the letter a or the top of the circle each quarter rotation of circle a around circle b or one full circle a rotation moves the initial contact point degrees away from its last location doing this four times gives the extra rotation x this exact math probably only works out for these specific circles but i would imagine there is something similar happening between any two circles with the two quarters being equally sized the initial contact point is degrees away from its previous location after the rotating quarter makes one full revolution after two revolutions there is another extra rotation x im not sure i can articulate it any better than this fascinating and extremely well made even by veritasium standards my knee jerk answer was also based on my assumption of what the problem was designed to test blinded by the fact that i am a geometry teacher i guess if i had to speculate i would say that the test makers probably initially envisioned the problem with the small circle rolling on a straight line representing the flattened out circumference of the larger circle since they were presumably trying to design an item to test students understanding of similarity they never reexamined their assumptions when they chose the more challenging diagram representation its a great lesson in the need to physically test our ideas loved the astronomy connection i figured it out after i saw the coins tricky i probably would have marked on the test interesting that the question makers made that mistake in my head popped almost instantly because essentially you are tracing a circle with a radius of r r r with the options laid out i really was confused i came up with the answer in a second or two and then wondered how could that possibly be incorrect i spent the next minutes learning how great video excellent video hopefully we can add perspective to the magic while excluding frames of reference and relativity concerns although a really nice segway to those areas as pointed out by jungreis at the center of circle a travels a circular path around circle b of length pi rb ra where rb is the radius of b and ra is the radius of a assuming circle a stays in contact without slipping then since the circumference of circle a is pi ra the number of turns circle a needs to make is rb ra ra where the pi terms cancel out for the sat question given a is so rb ra then the number of turns is ra ra ra or again not a sat multple choice option taking the veritasium simplest example of two identical coins ra rb then the number of turns is again rb ra ra and substituting gives what you did with physical models i did this in my head with imaginary lines on both circles on the paper i just completed one rotation at o clock so the answer that i concluded was but this was the dumbest way of doing this visually since the pictures of both circles could have been inaccurate i would have selected in the test since wasnt there people who selected three at the very least applied some math to it math is a gift for solving problems where you do not have the resources to physically check and i tried this in the reverse order the comment of darth insidious made a little bit of sense to me this is the most f ed up thing i have ever seen i wonder how many engineering outcomes ended up other than expected due to the natural assumption of rotations huge props to the women that calculated the orbits and trajectory for the space program and got it right i got as my first guess then saw you give the options and not see anything that high and chose no wonder everyone got it wrong there was literally no right answer listed lmao its not like people couldnt have figured it out i think any transmission or differential expert designer would probably get this if you think of it as a gear rotating around the other gear i think you can get it if you have experience i dont but my dad did i did it a slightly different way imagine the centres of the circles are fixed and the circles rotate like gears rotate circle b once counter clockwise circle a will rotate times clockwise as its the size now unpin the circles centres and lock the together so they no longer move with respect to each other as we rotated circle b once counter clockwise we need to rotate the entire system once clockwise to compensate and make the total rotations for circle b equal to this rotates circle a clockwise one more time for a total of i answered because it was the closest one by eye even knowing how this works seeing the rotation in action feels like witnessing black magic lol congrats on including the sidereal year in this presentation only hell matt stone one of the creators of south park is a sat math nerd and readily admits it ffs and youre using this g uy like hes a math expert even more ffs yeah now it got it its a thing of flat and curved space means circle will cover pi r when it rolls a straight line not on anothe circle or a sphere lol the nvt needs to calm down the sats and college is not at all the only path to being a productive member of society i chose because i visually rotated the smaller circle in my mind around the bigger circle idk how i can do that i just can cannot be the answer the questions talks about the rolling of a around b not asking how many times does a revolve around b i dont know how to do the math but youre effectively measuring the distance the center point of the outer circle travels around the center circle not the path of its edge right old news doing this before i see the answer i think its d edit darn i thought i had it for sure where reference to alex belloss can you solve my problems i have a question sir when we choose the bigger circle as frame of reference we assume the velocity of centre of smaller circle as v but when we choose smaller circle as frame of reference that means we assume smaller circle at rest so relative to the smaller circle the velocity of centre of larger circle should be v not the point you choose in video fantastic it gets you wrong so many times it is really cool i noticed that how could no one get it right people guess so i knew the answer probably was not listed my first answer was then i figured that i might be wrong so i chose three the analysis was terrific i really had no analysis close to this awesome quickly realized that would be the correct answer if the question asked how many times circle a would have to spin in place for b to revolve just once but that it didnt feel right for going around b because the angle at which they were in contact kept changing the other answers only seemed worse though my instinct told me that it would be a full revolution more or less but it took me a few minutes to actually prove it to myself i paused the video to figure it out ill keep watching after this but im going to say the correct answer is because the center point of a must traverse a circle that is times the radius of a my answer was do lower sat scores prevent one from becoming a plumber electrician mechanic or carpenter nope so if your cannot get into college you can earn lots of money instead of getting deep into debt to get a degree that will qualify you to work in burger king it s a easy problem if you use some little equations from elementary physics first the center of the little coin must describe a circumference of r r r radius so the center of the little coin must travel a distance of r pi units that is equal to pi r units then we can use the fact that in circular movement the distance must be equal to the product of the angle and the radius so the angle the little coin should turn is is pi r divided by r that is pi radians using the fact that pi radians is one complete turn we have complete turns the general result reached in the video seems very interesting to me thank you for showing it i got it right in the first place if you visualise it correctly and understand the question properly then the ans is yours let radius of b is and radius of a is now consider centre of circle a as a point and forget about circle a for centre to came back to its origin point it has to rotate around the circle with radius units units for circle b and unit for a which is the distance between centre and circle b if you draw it and visualise correctly then its very easy to understand so the distance that centre travelled is actually the circumference of a circle having radius units which is equal to pi apparently that one rotation is not one rotation but only th rotation so it requires of rotations like that ive never felt so proud of myself getting it right i am teaching hs physics and the first thing that came to my mind is rolling without slipping i got the answer within seconds my answer is b before wacthing the video lmao i got by the logic that the center is going to move in a circle having a radius of so pi pi but i thought it would be wrong since it wasnt in the options is it since travelling of a creates a circle with radius then pi pi shitty grammar too the correct answer is not the circumference of a is whereas the circumference of b is which is ax the is incorrect be cause its not making full rotation your counting it as full rotation because the letter a is facing north again which isnt a full rotation because the point you started at lets say a is north you started at exactly east and counted a full rotation when when when south of a touched the big circle a full rotation should have been counted when east of a touched the big circle again and meaning the correct answer is not those three students are delusional i was bad in math but good in english my immediate answer to the question was because i focused on the word revolution as i understood it circle a revolved around circle b only once but circle a rotated on its axis several times so we all got it right if we answer thats what counts vertasium does this mean our observed days per year for other planets is off or have we accounted for that why i looked at this vid at am i saw the thumbnail and thought oh a wave function im still only minutes in and i think its edit boom praise fourier that final bit about the sidereal year is mind blowing to me strange how sat has changed i took an sat each of my last two years in high school probably and i had never heard of the sat before taking it it was only the week before the test that we were told that next week wed all be taking some test and we didnt need to study for it just remember to bring two pencils i had no idea what the test was for we just didnt pay much mind to it many years later i heard of people going to quite a bit of trouble to study for the sat there were books telling you how to prepare for it it became a big deal to do well on the test now apparently it doesnt matter anymore this is the first ive heard that but then i dont keep track of these things gotta love the college board as explained at time in the video and are both valid answers depending on which reference is used to define the number of rotations i would argue that the original test was listing suggesting one valid answer but it failed to define explicitly where the observer is lol the first time i saw the question i answer by using the astronomical definition even better is it that chatgpt gets it wrong too if you aske i got it right yay i just pictured the diameter a circum being a stragiht line and pictured it laying around the circum of b and came up with and figured something is wrong with the test pi x d divide the two but the question asks when will it first reach the starting point that answer is which is what i thought you would end up with thats not math its a language anomaly well strictly speaking the center will be at the center all the time so the correct answer is but hey that is twisting the words so the answer you want needs a little bit more time to be solved this worlds technology and advancements would not be possible without the nerds nerds we all appreciate you or the radias is not a constant the question is intentionally unclear teachers will never admit they are wrong accept this truth show them the correct answer and move on they will know you know that you are smarter than them but they will never admit to that either move on wow i cant believe i got the right answer d when you said at the start to pause the video and attempt to solve the problem yourself my answer was but it wasnt on the answer list so i thought the math would be more a lot more complicated than just x pi pi since it is a multiple choice question how could everybody get it wrong mind blown yep i guessed my sat score reflects my success using math great video and thanks the point here is the meaning of words i am isl so it takes me longer to catch up to this details oh i get it wording does mean alot when discribing cause and effects or something close to what i said because not sure i used the words correctly since it takes effort to fully know the meaning of words credit to the mathematician who explained the answer so that a middle school student could understand thats a skill only the best have phonetically its pronounced sn y ou cur you are slightly wrong i think i think you have made a slight mistake you are running another same radius coin on a coin that is in rest how can you be sure that a rotation is completed see at the beginning of the rotation the r d space between r alphabet of the word quartet and d alphabet of the word dollar in the moving coin part of the moving coin was in contact with the rest coin a rotation is completed only when the r d part of the moving coin touches the rest coin again but when you are counting one rotation the r d part was against the fixed coin and didnt touch the rest coin according to me running coins of equal radius on each other will complete rotation reply please i paused at to think about the question and came up with because i read a title i figured it has a trick and because the circle goes around i figured it has to do one extra turn but then you laid possible answers and i was confused but i dont know if i wouldve arrived at that answer had i not known it was a tricky question to spot this trick you have to think independently and given the answers were presented to those students question the authority okay this is the proof that we live in the matrix obi wan kenobe would say that the answer is from a certain point of view a certain point of view i adore all of the films on the veritasium channel and this one is a fantastic illustration of a simple entertaining idea that may encourage you to view the world in a new way cool video i would interpret the situation by imagining the big circle is the solar gear and the small the planet gear their centres are then united by a bar or arm that rotates about the big circles centre think of an epicyclic gear train then we can count the rotations of the small circle the question originally asks for in two ways from the point of view of a frame tied to the arm which thus rotates with it and from the point of view of a fixed immobile frame in case the small circle gives three turns about the arm rotating frame but in case we must add the fact that the aforementioned rotating frame has also completed one turn and so we have four turns in total i would say that the sat question posed as it is is not actually wrong but ill posed more than one answer is possible my initial reaction when i saw the problem people in the s were stupid its obviously oh im stupid too son of a i have a feeling that this topic is related to around the world in days and the twist at the end or am i wrong i actually find the coin rotation paradox to be false the coin only made full rotation yes with two identical coins we see the outer coin right side up again when it rolls to the bottom but thats the error everyone is making keep in mind that the line being traveled is not a straight line it is curved and while the outer coin travels the curve is bending the outer coins direction of travel from the inside stationary coins perspective when the rotating coin reaches the bottom the outer coin is actually upside down at this location only having rotated half the length of both coins circumferences we think we see the outer coin right side up at the bottom but it is realistically upside down because the line is upside down calling that a full rotation is false the other side of the rotating coin still has yet to touch the inside coin for identical coins rotation around the circumference is equal to revolution its actually just a matter of perspective but even more so in what we are taught a matter of deception this question is also mis worded it should be how many rotations astronomers appreciate the distinct meaning of these two words it will take four rotations for the circle to return to where it was as this video shows in that process it will have made one revolution around the larger circle thanks for your sharing my first guess would have been based on the time limit s on the test but then immediately would have felt to be wrong because mathematically it doesnt play the choices handed out makes it extra tricky dick hi make a video on string theory thanks veritasium you need to stop automating your comment thread so as to keep victims of abuse silenced and isolated for more abuse there will be consequences to you and your family line for generations to come if you continue to put energy into such an endeavor the most interesting part about this for me personally was that i got the question totally correct thats just simply because im not particularly good at mathematics in any capacity so i just solved it by imagining the rotation happening physically its insane youre not saying the only valid answer is the word used is r e v o l u t i o n for fucks sake dear veritazium please publish more often youtube is boring without your updates we are longing for the new videos does this question make money and if yes then which job profile and how much money or does this question exist to profile people with a specific mindset or capability who can be a machine one day at wouldnt be it better to make the camera view not spinning the fact that the small circle is not spinning in the camera view makes it harder for me to grasp the proof speed v huh the circle looks still a fixed point on the small circle or the point of contact just a thought another extreme case is the rotation of one circle with radius r around another circle with radius which also brings this extra rotation otherwise nice video thanks theres a special place in math hell for the makers of this question love to get wrong so question minutes explanations in the grand scheme of all things that matter who cares i choose b i paused the video i could be wrong i thought the circumference of b divided by the circumference of a first way was to give any value to the radius of b and solve for circumference then divide that value by to get the radius of a and solve for circumference then divide circunference of b by that of a the second way i tried was just solve pi r pi r after canceling leaving you with which is fingers crossed playing the video to get the answer but it is b and you are doing the equations for the area of a circle not its circumference which is pi times the diameter the ratio of one third means that it has to be three times the length of the circumference logically case closed i acctually thought of it rotating before i calculated and found four but then four wasnt in the answers so i thought i was wrong until you said the question was wrong im more confused as of this day h o l y f u c k i had to stop and think about the problem alot for this video is this einsteinian relativity isnt it crazy how a bunch of math equations can be expressed as original n especially in exponential forms thumbnail does not say how any tie a will be turned so wait if you turn a circle inside out and then swap its axis so its rotating on the flat circles front side and turning on y axis while rotating on the axis then how many times would it rotate on the z axis if it only had side the opposite side would be an empty void with out dimension according to the planetary gearing formula the planet also rotates around the sun one time and that rotation must be added to the ratio hence the real ratio is actually i e planet rotations are required to circle the sun once in gearing the formula is sun diameter planet diameter another way to look at it if the circumference of the sun was laid flat the planet would have to move x its circumference to travel the distance moving in a straight path now assume the sun is a circle when you add the planets distance from the center of the sun the center of the planet sweeps a circle times its own circumference as it travels around the sun hence it rotates times im just a mechanical engineer this question does not belong on a high school test i got but its lol as the top coin starts with the bottom the bottom of the same coin does not return to its starting point in revolutions but your assumptions are wrong pi r for the circumference of each circle divide the larger circumference by the smaller one does this have anything to do with the proof of the area of a sphere being pi r sounds like it was a poorly designed and written question if so many people got it wrong the entire point of these standardized tests is to measure capability sounds like it failed to measure anything with any semblance of accuracy also name one time the average person will use any of these mathematical formulas or theories relativity in circles excellent video very well explained i am proud to say i actually got this one correct i also thought it was at first but i knew that wasnt correct it could not be that easy if veritasium made a whole video on the problem i then figured out where i went wrong and mathematically arrived at the same conclusions that are presented in the video horray i suppose years of watching channels like this was good for something this video reminded me why i love math and physics sorry i disagree with your demonstrations you have performed the equivalent of a visual slight of hand first distance is distance whether it is linear or curved moving in a circular path does not add distance to the circumference in the form of rotation in your demonstrations with the coins and circles what you did to add the apparent extra rotation was to divert the viewer from one point of reference to a different point of reference creating the appearance of needing an extra revolution to get back to the starting point you initially demonstrated with the coins same circumferences that it takes rotation of the coin around the fixed coin to return to the starting point however your reference point was to have george washingtons head be upright at the starting point then rotated it until it was upright again and stated that that was rotation which was only of a rotation you then continued to rotate the coin until his head was again upright stating rotations which again was only of a rotation you claimed rotations when in fact only rotation was made the point of reference should be at the point of contact between the coins and not the top of washingtons head given this at the starting point washingtons neck n the top coin is in relation to washingtons head in the bottom fixed coin watching the point of contact it takes rotation for washingtons neck to return to the top of washingtons head of the fixed coin the circumferences of the circles with the ratio of to are related by a factor of you never did the math to show this c pi x r circle a circle b these distances do not change as a result of the motion of circle a in a circular path around circle b as you stated the slight of hand occurs as a result of your reference point the letter a or the contact point of circle a with circle b you changed these to give the appearance that there is a real change you initially place the oclock position of circle a with the letter a at the oclock position in contact with the oclock position of circle b you then rotate circle a to the oclock position of circle b stopping when the a is upright counting this as however circle a only rotated of a rotation the oclock position of circle a the initial contact point has not yet reached circle b to complete the rotation which should actually be labeled as continuing in this manner when the oclock position touches circle b not when the letter a is upright circle a will make only rotations when the oclock position reaches the initial starting point of the oclock position of circle b center of the coin actually travels a distance of pi r r so the rotations will be pi r r pi r similar to straight line travel on same distance as usual in usa nobody cares till is an scandal and it can take tenths of years if its not its gonna be for some stupid semantics lets see iit had same question when i saw the drawing i imagined the small circle going around the big one and i was sure the rotations were more than and far below my answers was because i figured it had to be more than and seemed like too much remember spirograph thats how i came to know something was weird about circles and i never really grasped gears but loved the designs it would come up with i was always interested in astronomy and considered i was a better than average mathematician but no i fell for the intuitive answer somewhere along the video i tweaked at pi well whaddya know im smart but slow smart lol thanks for the video this has been my question from quite a while i ignored it back in the day given the other work but this has always been in back of my head i was dumbfounded when you were explaining this until i saw the perception of the smaller coin it looks like it is rotating twice but its orientation of the quarter being head up doesnt make it a full turn because the top of the coin is touching the second coin its only a full rotation when the when the bottom of the coin which was the original starting point is touching the second coin english would call this appalling grammar hahaha nice one commenting before the answer is revealed i think its either or but cant seem to work out which one the orbit around r would either add or subtract one rotation im going to go with i think if the circle travels pir distance in one turn the center too should travel a distance of pir otherwise that would turn out to be a different circle that wont happen so the total diatance it has to go with respect to point b is pir and one turn is pir so pir pir your video is very nice please make some video bengali if you rotate your perspective in order to keep the coins side by side then one of those answers becomes correct funny i just looked at it and imagined it would take rotations but then noticed wasnt an option so went with my father would often rush home to bathe with me ashley biden saying biden should be fair upstanding strong and honest is what they are essentially asking riiiiiiiiight lol hazegreyandunderway crook biden would never denounce colorados decision to remove president trump from the ballot because it is a combination of him emperor obama and the dnc that are pushing these efforts by blue states its one of the steps of the democrats overall election interference strategy this par see more but he definitely supported and insurrection what insurrection other than the msm calling it that and one judge in colorado before this colorado supreme court fiasco in a ruling that had no duy process for that charge where is the insurrection stop spreading misinformation mr president biden will do anything at this point to keep trumps name off the ballot because old slow joe knows joeys a total disaster how many crimes has he been charged with this national issue has no place in state courts if anybody has any say in keeping a person off a national ballot it should be elected legislators in the us congress can you imagine if any state decided to keep biden off the ballot i think the cult just doesnt want to admit they fell for his lies really how many times do you have to be told that biden is not running this show he doesnt even know who is president half the time its obama and his leftovers that pull puppet bidens strings read it and weep trump impeachments indictments felonies failed civil suits swift kick off the ballot biden before you say no convictions you should rememger who controlled the senate at that time and that none of these felonies have gone to trial yet of all the people cha words from trump on a twitter post would have stopped the january riot at the capitol in minutes people pleaded with him to call off his supporters cabinet members family and members of congress actually in the capitol building he kept watching tv he did nothing i cant think of one thing i admire about joe biden not one thing sounds like another perfect call from trump has surfaced lets not talk about the real fraud elephant in the room biden isnt about to stand up for the one guy who is guaranteed to stomp his guts out in the election when all was lost japanese troops would conduct a suicidal banzai charge youre seeing the democrat equivalent in colorado biden doesnt have enough control of the motor skills required to speak clearly we need the scotus to speak for him hell do whatever his handlers tell him to he doesnt decide anything no interference from the executive branch let the courts do their job no politicization of the courts there likely be an to ruling on this going either way trust the courts brandon to magats hahahahahaha in case nobody has noticed crooked joe biden and his puppeteers have flown the country into the ground precedent confirms a criminal conviction is not required to be disqualified under section of the fourteenth amendment no one who has been formally disqualified under section was charged under the criminal rebellion or insurrection statute u s c or its predecessors even if trump wins the election republicans would still need to amend our constitution so traitors can hold office why would biden get involved with this biden non person massivebluetidalwave presidents are not allowed to interfere with a states elections the framers clearly state that in the constitution in order to prevent presidents from being kings fact the antichrist couldnt have picked a better president to destroy our country the devil picked trump who is the antichrist rd world democracy convict your opponent without due process joe will do whatever barack tells him to do of course the left will speak out against the ruling in order to seem politically in a different light behind the scenes they have the novc act pact which so far has approx states and over electoral votes combined who have pledged to vote a certain way even against states voters elected fairs fair remove hunter from the ballot democrats when this fails based on the amendment trump is disqualified from office we are crafting the amendment as we speak and while we are aware that the keep trump from the white house amendment isnt close to ratification we feel it is in our best interest to act as if it is the part how do you make trump and any future presidents january th like misconduct accountable do not cry foul if any left president do what trump did in future its not about protecting a person its about protecting an institution from demagogue like trump and alike have biden removed from the ballot in texas texas and florida explain this trump pressured michigan canvassers not to certify election in recorded phone call shrazz having people over republicans are high if they think biden is going to call out this ruling seriously whats going through your heads i have to ask are you a republican a democrat or an independent all i can say is two can play that game right texas indiana florida when do you feel biden took part in an insurrection i loved how the colorado court cites gorsuchs own opinion regarding states rights and ballots too late for joe to say something he lost his chance and his mind barack and michael havent given him the go ahead just yet residents of magaville gravy seals and meal team do you all have your muskets ready for the civil war why should biden do anything laws exist for a reason if trump broke the law he should pay the price only thing sleepy will do is eat ice cream and fill diapers trump legal news brief recording surfaces of trump pressuring michigan officials not to certify election the most corrupt president in us history no one else comes close biden will never do that his heart and mind are so corrupted wont let him do the right thing democrat socialists have done this before expecting biden to stand up for what is right is like expecting a mute to speak biden must get marching orders from the obamas and the obamas love chaos and a good crisis that is how they win they create issues even false issues sadly now we are dealing with their self serving policies you also believed obama was born in kenya so lol i fully expect some election irregularities in the next election something that will conveniently delay the vote count in crucial places hahahaha how about impeachment then prison merry christmas because trump refusing to accept that he lost an election yah thats bidens fault cant expect brandon to do the right thing but lets pepper him with that question anyway those certainly are some unbiased voices fox chose to highlight fair and balanced lol its not up to beijing joe nothing is why would he do that it was probably his idea democrats and their shadowy philosophy have minority support only the propaganda media and their seeded operatives within the globalist cabal can leverage the illusion of progressive ideas eclipsing their actual regressive results carter clinton obama and virtual joe for recent examples a dec and its working you notice the majority keep putting democrats in office presidents are not allowed to interfere in a states elections no matter what your orange jesus told you biden may be forced to do it because of political pressures but he has always been a partisan hack and secretly loves what the court did presidents are not allowed to interfere in a states elections no matter what your orange jesus told you colorado judges well tell you who you can vote for constitution refers to the president as an officer times dont like the constitution why tell us all the constitution actually does that what you gonna do this decision is more of the unraveling of the democrat party in fear of losing power to common sense this decision respects the constitution of the united states of america its an issue in at least a dozen states it needs to go to the supreme court to make the decision try hats where well see gorsuch literally eat his own words hey trump tell us about this trump pressured michigan canvassers not to certify election in recorded phone call link to the recording please so we can evaluate what was said you guys have a history of twisting the truth decolonization a denouncement has no lawful effect but he aint smart or confident accept he runs a sophisticated crime family right higher pay and strong hiring encouraged more people to get off the sidelines the labor force participation rate for workers between the ages of and in november is trending near the highest rate in more than two decades evil resides in our white house evil got jettisoned in sorry maga americansickofbiden i find it funny that one would even think for a moment that biden actually helped spearhead this believe me he knew about this before it happened this is actually another example of how corupt democrats are and this administration and our court system is you just kinda twisted yourself in knots insurrectionists dont deserve to campaign for potus tell me youre afraid without saying the word beloved biden bot alotta anger are the justices on the colorado supreme court elected or appointed term limited dems just love those nothing burgers arent they delicious but at the end of the day youre hungry and feeling empty why would he do that brandon or o probably put them up to it why would he they followed the constitution they decided on their own that an insurrection occurred it didnt of china does anyone think that if the rolls were reversed trump wouldnt be over the moon that biden was removed from the ballot and encouraging the rest of the states to do it as well but that would mean trump has a conscience anyone who expects biden to denounce the courts ruling is crazy biden will do anything to get re elected biden is greedy and addicted to power hes also a puppet of china and china is doing very well with biden in the white house the jan th protester broke a few windows and then wandered around the capitol building talking to the police how exactly was that a violent take over of the government ask ashli babbitt oh wait exactly trump told them to go peacefully then you have the looters during the summer of love where kamala said they should not or will not stop growing calls from far right maga people there fixed it making america great again is not a radical idea destroying america is a radical idea ostrich we the people of united states of america can stand up to remove judges four judges broke oaths of us of constitution cry some more maga tears lets dothechickendance this is a primary election issue not a general election this is a repub problem let the repubs sort this out for themselves itll become a national issue when the general election cycle starts ok then how about the red states remove biden from their election rolls that would require moral ballast biden clan has none old joe thanks colorado i need all the help i can get pressing biden to denounce colorados attempt to make his election more solid really biden knows the only way to beat president trump is to take him off the ballot so afraid of trump so sad are the democrats he already beat trump and that was before trump committed treason what makes you think voters will flip their vote to trump after his actions bidens only hope is to remove trump from the ballot the best thing for the dems is to have trump on the general election ballot result will be same as thats something that will never happen joe biden can not make decisions on his own the puppet will do whatever the staffers want him to say or do make no mistake about it this all is leading to a one party government and if we the people dont stand up to this we deserve it written by a constitutional lawyer and former gop judge that was a consultant for the trump wh on jan so the dem judges did not write it election fraud trump recorded pressuring michigan canvassers not to certify election democrats ordering that illegals be granted voting rights election fraud i wonder if these liberals will ever learn hope not everytime they do something like this to trump it makes him stronger i know right every time trump faces the consequences of his actions that he refuses to take responsibility for his followers love him even more he tells men they can grab women without their consent they love him more he lies to their faces and they love him more he undermines our electoral liberals dont learn from their mistakes they just repeat them youre living in a fantasy land calling for joe biden to denounce colorados state supreme court ruling trump in the polls is beating him like a drum this is the gop attempting a jedi mind trick on joe what mind biden make a plea for actual justice he doesnt have it in him you mean a plea for trump to not have to abide by our constitution lets not get it twisted democrat party opposes democracy which is a system where voters get to select their elected leaders no dog thats called an election opposing democracy is pretending you won an election you lost trying to discredit all the votes even after everyone told you you los democrats oppose democracy at every turn i admit up front to two things i do not know if this is allowed in colorado but if so use the write in to put him on the ballot and the other thing yeah i could have used da google to find out if write in is an option but it is too early and i have only had two cups of coffee i had to write in an intelligent person for the presidential election im hoping there will be a choice for me in remove corrupt joe from the texas ballot he himself is a phony president he isnt about to go against the democrat partys wishes one way or another biden will be the last democratic candidate that plays nice and by the old rules if its an authoritarian you want thats what youll get and the generation that grew up on occupy wall street save the planet now and outlaw guns will be the ones taking the shortcuts and breaki you expect a president who hasnt done one thing right to get it right this time president biden won in a landslide and the countrys economy is better than evee its interesting that fox fails to mention that republicans are actually the ones that sued democrats to keep trump off the ballot in colorado the case that led to the colorado supreme court decision is named anderson v griswold the anderson is former republican state lawmaker norma anderson wh if biden was removed from the ballot do you think trump would denounce it if trumps lawyer was pushing election lies about georgia election workers do you think trump would denounce it lol biden is never going to end up on the ballot not going to happen why would he denounce it when republican constitution scholars from the federalist society say trump shouldnt be on the ballot no constitution scholar believes in sanction before due process anyone who does isnt worthy of a law degree biden wouldnt pull a hair to stop them but hell certainly encourage them and others to do the same he knows its the only chance he might have of winning biden wont denounce the ruling because he knows cheating is the only way he can win and did win democracy has nothing in common with biden and the liberal left socialist democrat party one party control is the objective of biden and the liberal left socialist democrat party would police and firefighters be the result of this socialist leaning asking for me not a friend the people who staged an insurrection after they lost an election demand a do over election what will they do if they lose that election he shouldnt have lied about losing the election everyone wouldve been happier youre confused brandon lied about winning the election what about state rights funny how that goes out the window when a republican doesnt like the ruling what does states rights have to do with denying due process thats a u s constitutional right unfortunately colorado turned blue and will remain blue no matter if trump is on the ballot or not no doubt this steady dose of liberals is led by the boulder contingent who is one of the most woke places in the u s an insurrection is a violent take over of the government how exactly was an unarmed unorganized protest mob going to take control of the government let adam schiff investigate this and find out the truth like he did with the russia interference he found unequivocal proof before oh wait never mind trump stands alone as the most corrupt president in us history no one else comes close then why are you so afraid he may win biden by far is the most corrupt dontcha think its a little too late for any drat to show any new colors he okd joe only cares about sniffing lil girls hair and chocolate chip ice cream cones each day is a new low with biden biden knows he has a poor chance against trump he wont do it when he loses he and his family get prosecuted this he knows hell answer as soon as obama gets his marching orders and transmits them to joes teleprompter i dont get it was trump convicted of committing insurrection how can these judges take him off the ballot using a crime he has never been convicted of or even accused of easy the dems do not follow the rules of law trump can end all of this today he just needs to share his proof that he promised america to back up his claims of election fraud and stolen elections whats the big challenge in doing that biden cannot think beyond his next diaper change and pudding cup she means w o stealing the election he can win without throwing trump off the ballot why would biden want to help trump he has announced to the media that yes he is an insurrectionist plus compares trump to hitler maga supporters are terrorists the last thing biden would do is stop the lies and help the man who is going to replace him in the w h ari fleischer oh fox youre killing me ha ha ha ha why does joes approval rating drop every time we attack democracy so trump told michigan officials not to certify election results wheres that story well obviously you heard about it in your trailer park newsletter the democratic socialistic cult party is destroying our democracy you must think and do as they say history has shown that this segment of society who want to silence opposing views are extremely dangerous to freedom history also shows they will face serious retribution from their own socie see more never forget you too can right click on a word for the definition yep its easy to win if your top competitor is removed from the ballot he called trump an insurrectionist what are the odds whats an even better way than harvesting to win an election support throwing the other guy off the ballot i cant think of a more anti american way to wield success what i dont understand about this jan nonsense is trump is literally on record before that day and during that day asking people to behave and stay in line yet liberals read his mind and come to a different conclusion i mean what could possibly go wrong with this plan doj warns states not to pursue their own arizona style election audits august the biden u s department of justice is now telling states that they should not pursue their own arizona style election audits the dojs new guidance document claims that undertaking partisan election audits co he cant do that give trump any support no way this entire th amendment issue was started by members of the federalist society the most constitutionally clued in legal group in america every one or the republican appointed sc justices is or was a member of the federalist society it is going to the supreme court let them decide and biden and his socialist marxists encouraged neverending protests and harassment at the residences of those he disagreed with on the scotus imagine that the sitting us president encouraged his followers to go after the families of those he and people like xxxx maxi pad maxine waters didn see more why would he do that joe biden is part of the cabal thatll do whatever it takes to remove trump from the ballot hey dems this is what election interference looks like hey maga this is what being held accountable for your crimes looks like the lefts fear of president trump is unprecedented we have russia hoaxes failed impeachments classified document scams jan sham trials and the current trials for supposed crimes which not surprisingly have no victims now we have rouge states attempting to exclude him from the ballo majority say they agree with dumping trump off the ballot with only of the state being registered as a republican they really dont have a voice in colorado that sounds like a gop problem not a democrat problem colorado just spoke for the us constitution socialists believe in winning at all costs the ends always justify the means biden is the best democrats have biden has made decades of racist comments and votes biden continues to make racist comments biden is guilty of quid pro quo with ukraine which he admits on video biden showered with his daughter when she was a child bidens policies have soured a lot of voters no jan th was nothing more than a mardi gras party trump won the election leading by hundreds of thousands of votes across the midwest at am only to lose the election by am when all the forged paper ballots were dumped into the system we all know it so why did trumps own attorney general say that didnt happen desperate ploy by the gop like saying oh this is going to backfire well lets just see let the state rights play out still dont get how an old geezer who hid out in his basement won the last election and where are all of his proud fans democrat operative mr president you have served your party well but now its time for you to step aside for a younger generation to take the reigns biden get off of my lawn lol why would he denounce it cheating and lying is their thing they care about winning and power nothing else and they dont care what they do or who they hurt to get it its really reaching unbelievable porportions yeah i remember when the democrats staged an insurrection after they lost an election oh wait that was your side truth pressure from who republicans you cant try to steal the election then attack the country take your wokeness out of this country please its like asking him to denounce stolen elections he knows hes illegitimate along with most other dems sc will rule in favor against colorado court what about trumps birther lies about obama did obama stomp his feet and whine like a baby what about yelling about lock her up what about insulting ted cruz for cheating in the iowa primary trump just cant take the heat everyone else handles it like a man trump acts like a baby one might be asking for this from a man with hate in his heart hilarious bidens handlers came up with this idea and now someone is suggesting that slow joe denounce it this leftist media machine is comical as well his handlers wont let him scotus will overturn this and end this liberal madness solipsism is overrated gorsuch agrees with colorado supreme court judge gorsuch said it is a states legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process that permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office no hes not all made up mr trump soon prisoner committed an act against this country that he is now paying the price for thats sweet justice tyrannical left trump has not been convicted of any crimes however biden has aided our foreign enemies under the th amendment he cannot be on any ballot in the united states hey republicans how exactly was donald trump defending and protecting the us constitution on j that he swore his sacred oath of office to defend and protect does no republican have the courage to reply merry christmas take a holiday from the hating you can start again on tuesday he has not been charged with or convicted of insurrection and thats why these partisan judges voted this way the other three did not and one was very vocal that it was wrong he wont denounce it he welcomes it lol biden should act like a statesman thats rich unlike cheeto this president believes in separation of powers and letting the process work take note cheeto yeah sure not if he did he wouldnt have said but he certainly supported an insurrection no question about it none zero not only are there questions about it nowhere has he been charged with insurrection president has now appointed himself prosecutor judge and jury theres a recording internet explodes over audio showing trumps pressure campaign trump on thursday was accused of having personally pressured at least two republicans to unlawfully block the election results and social media is exploding with comments on the audio recording hes going to jail who out there honestly believes jan was an insurrection i mean seriously not for political purposes but actually a true insurrection do you routinely bring a gallows to listen to a speach everyone except for trumps maga base soooo all right wing political hacks are calling for biden to do this lol okay good try im glad we actually follow whats written in the constitution these people must be afraid of trump getting the boot actually donald trump getting the boot in all would only help republicans chances in elections those of us who actually think and there are plenty who dont on both sides recognized that slow walk the criminal charges fast track the colorado ballot question trump hypocrisy at its finest we have the best economy in decades because of democrats policies and the republican candidate for president is not eligible to run today opposite day just remember a vote for anyone other than trump in is a vote for biden ouch the ship will sink at this point more realistically harris biden is in freefall both on his physical and mental health
