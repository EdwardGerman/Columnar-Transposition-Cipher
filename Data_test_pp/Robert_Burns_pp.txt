be best because they are thy will then all i want o do thou grant this one request of mine since to enjoy thou dost deny assist me to resign prayer under the pressure of violent anguish o thou great being what thou art surpasses me to know yet sure i am that known to thee are all thy works below thy creature here before thee stands all wretched and distrest yet sure those ills that wring my soul obey thy high behest sure thou almighty canst not act from cruelty or wrath o free my weary eyes from tears or close them fast in death but if i must afflicted be to suit some wise design then man my

from the seat of scornful pride casts forth his eyes abroad but with humility and awe still walks before his god that man shall flourish like the trees which by the streamlets grow the fruitful top is spread on high and firm the root below but he whose blossom buds in guilt shall to the ground be cast and like the rootless stubble tost before the sweeping blast for why that god the good adore hath givn them peace and rest but hath decreed that wicked men shall neer be truly blest first six verses of the ninetieth psalm versified the o thou the first the greatest friend of all the human race whose strong right hand has ever been their stay and dwelling place before the mountains heavd their heads beneath thy forming hand before this ponderous globe itself arose at thy command that powr which raisd and still upholds this universal frame from countless unbeginning time was ever still the same those mighty periods of years which seem to us so vast appear no more before thy sight than yesterday thats past thou givst the word thy creature man is to existence brought again thou sayst ye sons of men return ye into nought thou layest them with all their cares in everlasting sleep as with a flood thou takst them off with overwhelming sweep they flourish like the morning flowr in beautys pride arrayd but long ere night cut down it lies all witherd and decayd prayer in the prospect of death o thou unknown almighty cause of all my hope and fear in whose dread presence ere an hour perhaps i must appear if i have wanderd in those paths of life i ought to shun as something loudly in my breast remonstrates i have done thou knowst that thou hast formed me with passions wild and strong and listning to their witching voice has often led me wrong where human weakness has come short or frailty stept aside do thou all good for such thou art in shades of darkness hide where with intention i have errd no other plea i have but thou art good and goodness still delighteth to forgive stanzas on the same occasion why am i loth to leave this earthly scene have i so found it full of pleasing charms some drops of joy with draughts of ill between some gleams of sunshine mid renewing storms is it departing pangs my soul alarms or deaths unlovely dreary dark abode for guilt for guilt my terrors are in arms i tremble to approach an angry god and justly smart beneath his sin avenging rod fain would i say forgive my foul offence fain promise never more to disobey but should my author health again dispense again i might desert fair virtues way again in follys part might go astray again exalt the brute and sink the man then how should i for heavenly mercy pray who act so counter heavenly mercys plan who sin so oft have mournd yet to temptation ran o thou great governor of all below if i may dare a lifted eye to thee thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow or still the tumult of the raging sea with that controlling powr assist evn me those headlong furious passions to confine for all unfit i feel my powrs to be to rule their torrent in th allowed line o aid me with thy help omnipotence divine
