through the disguise wont you open your eyes the light like an unsung melody the truth is waiting there for you to find it its not a blight but a remedy a clear reminder of how it began deep inside your memory turned away as you struggled to find it you heard the call as you walked away a voice of calm from within the silence and for what seemed an eternity you wait and hoping it would call out again you heard the shadow reckoning then your fears seemed to keep you blinded you held your guard as you walked away when you think all is forsaken listen to me now you need never feel broken again sometimes darkness can show you the light an unforgivable tragedy the answer isnt where you think youd find it prepare yourself for the reckoning for when your world seems to crumble again dont be afraid to turn away youre the one who can redefine it dont let hope become a memory let the shadow permeate your mind and reveal the thoughts that were tucked away so that the door can be opened again within your darkest memories lies the answer if you dare to find it dont let hope become a memory when you think all is forsaken listen to me now you need never feel broken again sometimes darkness can show you the light sickening weakening dont let another somber pariah consume your soul you need strengthening toughening it takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you ignite the fire within you when you think all is forsaken listen to me now you need never feel broken again sometimes darkness can show you the light dont ignore listen to me now you need never feel broken again sometimes darkness can show you the light what are you waiting for so what you waiting for so what you waiting for i have never compromised i never gave in and so i have welcomed every challenge in my life and i have never wandered blind im led by hunger and so i savor every drop each minute im alive leave nothing left behind so what you waiting for tell me what you waiting for dont stand by and deny it so what you waiting for tell me what you waiting for break new ground and defy it dont let the world outside leave you cornered and alone so what you waiting for tell me what you waiting for

vision softly creeping left its seeds while i was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dare disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach to you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning and the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence never wrong youre never ever wrong no youre never wrong never no youre never ever wrong no youre never wrong never
