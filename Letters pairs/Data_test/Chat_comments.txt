This is called good policing you tool. If you’d not shared a shortened version of the video, you’d know they safely disarmed and restrained the man, without anyone getting hurt. Thats how it should be done. That’s called restraint, it requires discipline.

It would be racist to arrest him
In a comparable situation, German police used pepper spray, electroshocks and finally shot the attacker. The perpetrator got an official funeral and the police officer is officially accused for murder.
Next time, police might let attackers run away which could get more innocent…
Why didn’t they just Taze him bro?

What you fail to say is the United Kingdom has police with no guns.  So the UK is putting their cops in danger every day.  Instead of a cop being allowed to point a gun at this scum bum, at least 3 cops have to tackle him and one of them may get their throat slit.

Cardioid for equal radii and an epicycloid for unequal radii.
Otherwise, it is all quite good, 1, 3, 4.
BUT ... consider a pair of meshing gearwheels, with one of three times the diameter of the other.  The big one will have three times as many teeth as the small one, and for each one if its revolutions the smaller gearwheel will rotate three times, not four.
Oh what fun 😄
great video!
Just came to watched this video looking at a maths problem.
Didn't have any idea it would also explain the concept of sidereal day, which I haven't ever understood till today.
Your videos are concise, yet fully understandable.
There is a much easier way to see this.  Thought they would hit it in the video, but they did not apparently.
Do NOT roll the circle A.  This will make it much easier to see what happens, and why.
Take A, with a fixed point on the edge.  Attach that point to a STRAIGHT line the length of B circumference.
Slide the point on A along the straight line B.  A does not rotate.
Now curve the straight line B back around into the circle B.  Again slide the single point on A along the now circular B circumference.  The curvature of B rotates A once as you go around.  The 360 degrees of this rotation come entirely from the curvature of B swinging A around, not from A 'rolling'.
Then A of course has its three rolls when you do roll A on B.
Others have said similar things, but you really need to fix the point on A and NOT roll the circle, then compare the 'straight B' vs the 'circled B', to really understand the difference correctly.
This problem is actually far more complicated than most reply which have commented here.
If we only calculate that the center of the circle of small coins travels four times the radius, then we only need to travel four times. In fact, many logical problems are ignored.
Wikipedia's description of this problem includes a picture of a colorful circle, which clearly shows that if the circumference is divided into 36 parts, each of which is 12 degrees, "the circumference of the small coin has indeed only traveled three times, not four." .
But why does the experiment appear to be four circles?
The reason is: "Three circles is relative to the circumference of the small coin; four circles is relative to the the center of the small coin."
Circumference of the small coin travelled 3  circles ;  Centre of the small coin travelled 4 circles.
Just shrink the coin's head to infinitesimal size and use the concept of differentiation to understand. The direction of the head can represent the direction of the centre of the small coin.
But why do the "circumference travelled" and the "center travelled" have different values?
The reason is that the distance traveled by the center of the circle is longer. In this problem, when the circumference travels three times, the center needs to travel four times of circumference.
Therefore, at the same time, the center of the circle moves four times and the circumference moves three times, their speeds are fundamentally different.
But why can the same coin accommodate these different speeds? The reason is that even if they belong to the same solid body, the center and circumference of the circle are on different movement curves.

But the coin is a concrete material, why the times of centre rotated is different from the circumference rotated?
It is the most difficult part of this question.
Isn't this a problem of perspective? People who see the outer circle making one additional revolution are being fooled by perspective. In your study, it is the only way to see the additional revolution when there are two ways of proving the original answer. In the end, given the ambiguity of the question itself, the scorers should have simply agreed that both answers would be marked as correct, despite there really only being one answer.
I actually got the correct answer when considering it for a minute in my mind but then saw, that it wasn't an option so I thought I must have gotten something wrong and then also chose 3 🙄
The curse of my life ... not trusting in my own abilities enough, always thinking the mistake must lie with me first 🙈
EDIT: And I actually intuited the exact same correct explanation in my mind with 3 times circumference + 1 going around the circle ... but still thought I must be wrong when not presented with the right choice. Aggravating!
So probably about everyone got their point out of the question because answer B was deemed correct.
I was biased w/ the title, so after reaching an initial answer of 3 in few seconds, I thought about it, and decided to make the shapes triangles since I couldn't track the rotation in my mind without drawing it, then I realized there's more angle to cover (120 deg) to reset the position of start. w/ 3 angles, there would be one more, but I got real confused 'cause there were no option w/ "4" as the answer
As jee aspirant i got 4planet-orange-purple-ring
I believe every problem should be simplified:
- The outer circle rotates around the center of the inner circle; therefore:
- The amount of revolutions is equal to the sum of the radii of both circles.
Probably at least half of my time during school tests was spent figuring out which answers did the teachers expect instead of the right one.
The amount of ambiguity and assumptions was staggering.

Answer:- piD÷pid or pi 6÷ pi2= 3or (B)
Haven't watched it yet, it's 6. (2π3)/(2π1)=6 And now, how did I do?
Without watching the video, I saw them as gears so thought "3"
I thought 3 from the available answers but I felt it was wrong for some reason. 😂
I immediately thought 1 because of the wording.
it's funny how only 3 students out of thousands who took the test found the error, yet in this chat many people claimed to find the screw-up....I guess we're just smarter than your 80s kids....either that or we're more full of it as we type utter BS on youtube videos.
Certainly! Here's a refined version of your text:
I found myself captivated by the video, requiring multiple viewings to fully grasp its mesmerizing effect. However, upon closer inspection, a subtle flaw emerged, initially escaping my notice. When the coin was set into motion, the top of the head aligned with the top, but as the rotation progressed halfway, the section that initially made contact at the top now lacked any connection. It's a testament to the power of perception—standing on the opposite side of the table, turning in tandem with the coin, transforms the head into an upside-down perspective. A marked bottom revealed that it never quite returned to its original contact point at the bottom, even though, during the flat run, a portion of the head seemed to make contact upside down. Wrapping the straight around the main coin clarified that the upside-down head was, in fact, facing upward.
This illusion extends to the cardboard cut out as well. The rotation seemingly stops just when the 'A' becomes legible, but a simple test involving a marked starting point with a pen reveals that the circle needs to turn further to re-establish the same contact point. It's a fascinating illusion, showcasing the intricate interplay of visual perception. Please do it again by marking a start point!
the fact that i actually thought immediatly that its 4, my thought proces didnt include the rotation paradox but i imagined it in my head going around
Portuguese dubs? cool
Whelp, I took the 1982 SAT and I got it wrong!  I used to think I was good at math.  lol
There are regions in the US where the SAT was never expected. Instead, the ACT was.
I tried to figure out how many times the small circle would rotate to get the answer, and i thought it was around 4.  I thought the answer was therefore 9/2 as that was the closest to my estimate.  Turns out my intuition lined up with what the actual answer was.  Being an amateur astronomer I also had heard the term sidereal as you can enter that into your telescope as certain settings.  Never heard a good explanation for what that meant.  Loved this video!
Maths problems on uk test papers are normally deliberately and obviously not too scale, to ensure students do the maths to find the answer and don't measure the diagram. Source: I've looked at several GCSE past papers recently.
Scam ads
Yep, I picked 3. Another great example of how reality diverges from our intuition.
What is ur email i want to send you my ideas
I paused the video my answer is 3 but when the point the circumference moves it's does not move in a straight line so my 6 the sense tell me it's 9
Why isn’t the answer as simple as “The initial intersection point touches the big circle three times in one circumnavigation. So the answer is 3, plus 1 for the circumnavigation, equals 4.” It’ll give you 18 minutes back in your life.

Stopped to try and think the question. Seems like it should be 4 (3 times due to radius difference, plus one more due to the full rotation of the point of contact to circle B). 
Interested to see how far off the answer really is!
I found his explanation very intriguing. I think he would be a great teacher. This was also a lot of fun to watch! 0:01
How could some people people's score go down by throwing a question out? Do the remaining questions now carry slightly more point value, so a wrong answer is now more "negative"?
Consider the students who failed the test by 1 point.
As soon as I saw the question I thought the answer was 3 but it turned out to be much more! Very interesting video!
If they had asked the question to milling machine operators, they would have get the correct answer. Calculating Toolpaths is done in this branch on a daily basis. And they would have said plus one diameter of the tool on the outside of the contour and minus one diameter of the tool on the inside of the contour.
Everyone keeps using the word rotation.  The question asks how many revolutions it will take to get to the starting point.  My answer is 1.
Oh wow, my dumb dumb butt guess of 4 was actually right,  i just imagined circle is 360 degrees and cut into 4 pieces for the size of that smaller coin...kind of like in the video???
You have 1 minute per question, it's multiple-choice for a reason. You don't need to do a full interpretation of the wording or show your work. You can justify 3, just select 3 and move on - there's no time to waste. People get screwed over because of their perfectionism and wasting more time on this than it was worth (turned out it was worth 0). It sucks but that should your strategy be. If you have doubts and spare time at the end, you can always go back to the question.
We had the same test question in middle school but with two equal sized coins. Most classmates got it wrong and I don't think anyone understood the math teacher's explanation afterwards. We just had to accept and memorize the answer after trying it out with real coins.
ahhh that circle moving inside the larger circle @10:21 should be spinning the other way.
Men sacrificed their hairline in pursuit of knowledge...
I know I am Asian but it was stupidly easy I got 4 in like a second😂😂
If you grow A to be the same perimeter as B, then n(2xpixr)=3(2xpixr) is the equation to solve.
I was so confused, I found 2 different ways of calculating it both for an answer of 4. 
But... 4 wasn't in the options, so I spent a good 30 minutes trying to figure out what I did wrong and how to get a different idea. 
I was about to pick 9/2 because it's the closest option.
Wow , great video 😮

You have a good enough mathematics intuition for studying mathematics, yet you're technically wrong.  😅
lol got that right on first try ... being completely honest had a pi component left but realized that distance covered by a circle in one revolution is 2*pi*r and not 2*r :P
Dont know much about formulas to calculate the rotations the way they did, but I could see the 4 rotations in my mind and was confused  with the answers provided. Thought I must be mistaken somehow, but when they said 4. . . .hilarious.
Interesting video. . .
This is a great example of "read the question" (which I am always telling my students). The last line says "how many revolutions of circle A will the center of circle first reach its starting point?" So, as pointed out, if you take the ratio of the distance travelled by the centre of the circle over the circumference of the smaller wheel, you get 4, irrespective of what is happening at the edge of the circle.
It seems to me that instead of throwing that question out they should have just given all test takers credit for that question. Throwing it out altogether does seem somewhat unfair for the test writers' error.
I love the little "not to scale" in showing the Earth rotating around the Sun.  Lol
I came up with 4 cuz it looked like it'd go around 4 times, opened the video, saw it was multiple choice,  chose 9/2 cuz that's the closest to my original answer and was pretty surprised when I turned out to be right.
Im glad I wasn't stupid when i heard "revolves" and thought "obviously it is 1, it takes one revolution around circle B to get to the starting point that is literally the definition of revolution"
The correct answer is "4". Explanation starts at @3:20 mark.
I stopped the video at 0:25 and now we will see how much of an idiot I am. I know the circumference of a circle is 2πr, so the large circle should have a circumference of about ~18.84 and the smaller circle is about ~6.28, so it should be 3 revolutions. Now I'll watch the video to be told why I am wrong. (Obviously I must be wrong or lots of people would not have missed the question.)
I don't think this is always the case, but for this example, I also noticed that the initial contact point between Circle A and Circle B is 90 degrees away from the location of the letter A (or the "top" of the circle). Each quarter rotation of Circle A around Circle B (or one full Circle A rotation) moves the initial contact point 90 degrees away from its last location. Doing this four times gives the "extra" rotation (90 x 4 = 360). This exact math probably only works out for these specific circles, but I would imagine there is something similar happening between any two circles.
With the two quarters being equally sized, the initial contact point is 180 degrees away from its previous location after the rotating quarter makes one full revolution. After two revolutions, there is another extra rotation (180 x 2 = 360). I'm not sure I can articulate it any better than this.
Fascinating, and extremely well made even by Veritasium standards! My knee-jerk answer was also 3, based on my assumption of what the problem was designed to test. Blinded by the fact that I am a geometry teacher, I guess. If I had to speculate, I would say that the test makers probably initially envisioned the problem with the small circle rolling on a straight line representing the "flattened-out" circumference of the larger circle. Since they were (presumably) trying to design an item to test students' understanding of similarity, they never reexamined their assumptions when they chose the more "challenging" diagram representation. It's a great lesson in the need to physically test our ideas!
LOVED the astronomy connection!
I figured it out after I saw the coins...tricky. I probably would have marked 3 on the test
Interesting that the question makers made that mistake. In my head 4 popped almost instantly because essentially you are tracing a circle with a radius of 4r(r+3r). With the options laid out, I really was confused...
I came up with the answer, 3, in a second or two, and then wondered "how could that possibly be incorrect".    I spent the next 18 minutes learning how.   Great video!
Excellent video.  Hopefully we can add perspective to the "magic" +1 while excluding frames of reference and relativity concerns (although a really nice segway to those areas):  As pointed out by Jungreis at 8:38 the center of circle A travels a circular path around circle B of length 2*pi*(rB+rA) where rB is the radius of B and rA is the radius of A.  Assuming circle A stays in contact without slipping then, since the circumference of circle A is 2*pi*rA, the number of turns circle A needs to make is (rB+rA)/rA where the 2*pi terms cancel out
For the SAT question given A is 1/3 so rB = 3*Ra then the number of turns is (3*rA + rA)/rA or (3+1)/1 == 4 (again not a SAT multple choice option)
Taking the Veritasium simplest example of two identical coins rA = rB = 1 then the number of turns is again (rB+rA)/rA and substituting gives (1+1)/1 == 2
What you did with physical models, I did this in my head with 4 imaginary lines on both circles on the paper, I just completed one rotation at 12 o clock so the answer that I concluded was 4 but this was the dumbest way of doing this visually since the pictures of both circles could have been inaccurate. I would have selected 9/2 in the test since 4 wasn't there.
People who selected three at the very least applied some math to it.
Math is a gift for solving problems where you do not have the resources to physically check and I tried this in the reverse order : (
The comment of Darth_insidious made a little bit of sense to me.
this is the most f*ed up thing I have ever seen.  I wonder how many engineering outcomes ended up other than expected due to the natural assumption of 3 rotations.  Huge props to the women that calculated the orbits and trajectory for the space program and got it right!
I got 16 as my first guess, then saw you give the options and not see anything that high and chose 9. No wonder everyone got it wrong, there was literally no right answer listed lmao. It's not like people couldn't have figured it out.
I think any transmission or differential expert / designer would probably get this. If you think of it as a gear rotating around the other gear, I think you can get it (if you have experience; I don't, but my dad did).
I did it a slightly different way. Imagine the 2 centres of the circles are fixed, and the circles rotate like gears. Rotate circle B once counter clockwise. Circle A will rotate 3 times clockwise, as it's 1/3 the size. Now unpin the circles' centres, and lock the 2 together, so they no longer move with respect to each other. As we rotated circle B once counter clockwise, we need to rotate the entire system once clockwise to compensate and make the total rotations for circle B equal to 0. This rotates circle A clockwise one more time, for a total of 4.
I answered 9/2 because it was the closest one by eye ☹️
Even knowing how this works seeing the rotation in action feels like witnessing black magic lol
Congrats on including the sidereal year in this presentation!!
Only 800? Hell, Matt Stone, one of the creators of South Park is a 1600 SAT math nerd and readily admits it........ffs and youre using this g uy like hes a math expert....... even more ffs
Yeah now it got it it’s a thing of flat and curved space. Means circle will cover 2pi r when it rolls a straight line not on anothe circle or a sphere.
lol, the NVT needs to calm down.
The SATs and college is not at all the only path to being a productive member of society.
I chose 3 because I visually rotated the smaller circle in my mind around the bigger circle... (idk how I can do that i just can)
1 cannot be the answer, the questions talks about the "rolling" of A around B. Not asking how many times does A revolve around B.
I don't know how to do the math, but you're effectively measuring the distance the center point of the outer circle travels around the center circle, not the path of its edge, right?
Old news.

Doing this before I see the answer, I think it’s D (edit; darn I  thought I had it for sure)
Where reference to Alex Bellos's can you solve my problems?
I have a question sir 
When we choose the bigger circle as frame of reference we assume the velocity of centre of smaller circle as " v "
But when we choose smaller circle as frame of reference that means we assume smaller circle at rest. So relative to the smaller circle the velocity of centre of larger circle should be "-v" not the point you choose in video.
Fantastic. It gets you wrong so many times it is really cool
I noticed that how could no one get it right? - people guess, So i knew the answer probably was not listed. My first answer was 1.Then I figured that I might be wrong so I chose Three. The analysis was terrific. I really had no analysis close to this. AWESOME!!
Quickly realized that 3 would be the correct answer if the question asked how many times circle A would have to spin in place for B to revolve just once, but that it didn't feel right for going around B because the angle at which they were in contact kept changing. The other answers only seemed worse though.
My instinct told me that it would be a full revolution more or less, but it took me a few minutes to actually prove it to myself. (I paused the video to figure it out.) I'll keep watching after this, but I'm going to say the correct answer is 4 because the center point of A must traverse a circle that is 4 times the radius of A.
My answer was 1
Do lower SAT scores prevent one from becoming a plumber, electrician, mechanic or carpenter? Nope. So, if your cannot get into college you can earn lots of money instead of getting deep into debt to get a degree that will qualify you to work in Burger King.
It´s a easy problem if you use some little equations from elementary physics. First, the center of the little coin must describe a circumference of R/3 +R =(4/3)·R radius. So, the center of the little coin must travel a distance of 2·(4/3)R·pi units, that is equal to 8·pi·R/3 units. Then we can use the fact that in circular movement, the distance must be equal to the product of the angle and the radius. So the angle the little coin should turn is is 8·pi·R/3 divided by R/3, that is 8·pi radians. Using the fact that 2·pi radians is 360º, one complete turn, we have 4 complete turns.
The general result reached in the video seems very interesting to me, thank you for showing it.
I got it right in the first place. If you visualise it correctly and understand the question properly then the ans is yours.
Let radius of B is 3 and radius of A is 1. Now consider centre of circle A as a point and forget about circle A. For centre to came back to its origin point it has to rotate around the circle with radius 4 units(3 units for circle B and 1 unit for A which is the distance between centre and circle B (if you draw it and visualise correctly then its very easy to understand😉)).
So, the distance that centre travelled is actually the circumference of a circle having radius 4 units which is equal to 8pi.
Apparently that one rotation is not one rotation but only 3/4th rotation so it requires 4 of rotations like that
I’ve never felt so proud of myself getting it right 😅
I am teaching HS physics and the first thing that came to my mind is rolling without slipping. I got the answer 4 within 10 seconds.
My answer is B, before wacthing the video
Lmao I got 4 by the logic that the center is going to move in a circle having a radius of 4 so 8pi/2pi but I thought it would be wrong since it wasn't in the options
is it 4? Since travelling of A creates a circle with radius 4, then 8pi/2pi=4
Shitty grammar too.
The correct answer is 3, not 4, the circumference of A is 6.283, whereas the circumference of B is 18.849. Which is Ax3, the 4 is incorrect be cause it’s not making full rotation, your counting it as 1 full rotation because the letter A is facing north again which isn’t a full rotation because the point you started at let’s say A is north , you started at exactly east, and counted a full rotation when when when South of A touched the big circle, a full rotation should have been counted when east of A touched the big circle again, and meaning the correct answer is 3, Not 4, those three students are delusional
I was bad in math but good in English. My immediate answer to the question was 1 because I focused on the word revolution as I understood it. Circle A revolved around circle B only once but circle A rotated on its axis several times.
So we all got it right if we answer 3, that’s what counts 😂
@vertasium Does this mean our observed days per year for other planets is off or have we accounted for that?
Why i looked at this vid at 4am...
I saw the thumbnail and thought "Oh, a wave function!"
I'm still only 3 minutes in and I think it's 4.
Edit: BOOM! Praise Fourier.
That final bit about the sidereal year is mind blowing to me!
Strange how SAT has changed. I took an SAT each of my last two years in high school, probably 1976 and 1977. I had never heard of the SAT before taking it. It was only the week before the test that we were told that next week we'd all be taking some test and we didn't need to study for it. Just remember to bring two #2 pencils. I had no idea what the test was for. We just didn't pay much mind to it.
Many years later I heard of people going to quite a bit of trouble to study for the SAT. There were books telling you how to prepare for it. It became a big deal to do well on the test.
Now apparently it doesn't matter anymore? This is the first I've heard that. But then, I don't keep track of these things.
Gotta love the College Board
As explained at time 6:48 in the video, 3 and 4 are both valid answers, depending on which reference is used to define the number of rotations.... I would argue that the original test was listing suggesting one valid answer (3) but it failed to define explicitly where the observer is...
Lol, the first time I saw the question, I answer 1 by using the astronomical definition
Even better is it that ChatGPT gets it wrong too 🙂
If you aske
I got it right!!!!!! yay. I just pictured the diameter A circum being a stragiht line, and pictured it laying around the circum of B, and came up with 4, and figured something is wrong with the test...
Pi x D. Divide the two.
But the question asks when will it First reach the starting point.  That answer is 0, which is what I thought you would end up with. That's not math, it's a language anomaly.
Well, strictly speaking, the "center" will be at the center all the time, so the correct answer is 0, but hey... That is twisting the words, so the answer you want needs a little bit more time to be solved.
this world's technology and advancements would not be possible without the nerds.   Nerds, we all appreciate you.
or, the radias is not a constant, the question is intentionally unclear
Teachers will never  admit they are wrong.! Accept this truth,show them the correct answer, and move on.They will know you know that you  are smarter than them ,but they will never admit to that either ..Move on.
4:45 wow, I can't believe i got the right answer :D when you said at the start to pause the video and attempt to solve the problem yourself, my answer was 4, but it wasn't on the answer list so i thought the math would be more a lot more complicated than just 4 x 2pi / 2pi
Since it is a multiple choice question, how could EVERYBODY get it wrong?
Mind blown.
Yep, I guessed 3.   My SAT score reflects my success using math.  Great video and thanks.
the point here is the meaning of words, i am ISL so it takes me longer to catch up to this details...
oh i get it' wording does mean alot when discribing cause and effects... or something close to what i said because not sure i used the words correctly since it takes effort to fully know the meaning of words...
Credit to the mathematician who explained the 4 answer so that a middle school student could understand. That’s a skill only the best have!
Phonetically it's pronounced Sn - (y)ou - cur.
You are slightly wrong.i think.
I think you have made a slight mistake. You are running another same radius coin on a  coin that is in rest. How can you be sure that a rotation is completed? See,At the beginning of the rotation the R-D(space Between "R" Alphabet of the word  QUARTET and "D" Alphabet of the word DOLLAR in the moving Coin) part of the moving coin was in contact with the rest coin. A rotation is completed only when the R-D part of the moving coin touches the rest coin again. But when you are counting one rotation the R-D part was against the fixed coin and didn’t touch the rest coin. According to me, running 2 coins of equal radius on each other will complete 1 rotation.
Reply please
I paused at 0:25 to think about the question and came up with 4.  Because I read a title, I figured it has a trick, and because the circle goes around, I figured it has to do one extra turn. But then you laid possible answers, and I was confused 😂 But I don't know if I would've arrived at that answer, had I not known it was a tricky question. To spot this trick, you have to think independently and (given the answers were presented to those students) question the authority.
Okay. This is the proof that we live in the Matrix 🤣
Obi-Wan Kenobe would say that the answer is 3... from a certain point of view.
(A certain point of view?)
I adore all of the films on the Veritasium channel, and this one is a fantastic illustration of a simple, entertaining idea that may encourage you to view the world in a new way.
Cool video! I would interpret the situation by imagining the big circle is the solar gear and the small, the planet gear. Their centres are then united by a bar or arm that rotates about the big circle's centre (think of an epicyclic gear train). Then we can count the rotations of the small circle the question originally asks for in two ways: 1) from the point of view of a frame tied to the arm which, thus, rotates with it; and 2) from the point of view of a fixed, immobile frame. In case 1), the small circle gives three turns about the arm -rotating frame-, but in case 2) we must add the fact that the aforementioned rotating frame has also completed one turn, and so we have four turns in total. I would say that the SAT-question posed as it is is not actually wrong, but "ill-posed": more than one answer is possible.
My initial reaction when I saw the problem?  People in the 80s were stupid, it's obviously 3..... Oh, I'm stupid too. Son of a.....
I have a feeling that this topic is related to "Around the World in 80 Days" and the twist at the end - or am I wrong?
I actually find the coin rotation paradox to be false. The coin only made 1 full rotation. Yes, with two identical coins, we see the outer coin right side up again when it rolls to the bottom, but that's the error everyone is making. Keep in mind that the line being traveled is not a straight line. It is curved, and while the outer coin travels, the curve is bending the outer coin's direction of travel. From the inside (stationary) coin's perspective, when the rotating coin reaches the bottom, the outer coin is actually upside down at this location, only having rotated half the length of both coins' circumferences. We think we see the outer coin right side up at the bottom, but it is realistically upside down, because the line is upside down. Calling that a full rotation is false. The other side of the rotating coin still has yet to touch the inside coin. For 2 identical coins, 1 rotation around the circumference is equal to 1 revolution. It's actually just a matter of perspective, but even more so in what we are taught .... a matter of Deception.
This question is also mis-worded. It should be "How many ROTATIONS". Astronomers appreciate the distinct meaning of these two words.
It will take four rotations for the circle to return to where it was - as this video shows. In that process, it will have made ONE REVOLUTION around the larger circle.

Thanks for your sharing
My first guess would have been 9/2 based on the time limit(s) on the test, but then immediately would have felt to be wrong because mathematically it doesn't play.  The choices handed out makes it extra tricky dick.
Hi, make a video on string theory. Thanks.
Veritasium, you need to stop automating your comment thread so as to keep victims of abuse silenced and isolated for more abuse.  There will be consequences to you and your family line for generations to come if you continue to put energy into such an endeavor.
The most interesting part about this for me personally, was that I got the question totally correct.
That's just simply because I'm not particularly good at mathematics in any capacity so I just solved it by imagining the rotation happening physically.
It's INSANE you're not saying the ONLY VALID ANSWER IS 1..... The word used is R E V O L U T I O N for fucks sake
Dear Veritazium, please publish more often. Youtube is boring without your updates. We are longing for the new videos)
Does this question make money and if yes then which job profile and how much money? Or does this question exist to profile people with a specific mindset or capability who can be a machine one day?
At 9:20, wouldn't be it better to make the Camera View not spinning?
The fact that the small circle is not spinning in the Camera View makes it harder for me to grasp the proof. 
(Speed -V? huh? The circle looks still... A fixed point on the small circle or the point of contact?).
Just a thought: another extreme case is the rotation of one circle with radius r around another circle with radius 0, which also brings this extra rotation.
Otherwise, nice video, thanks!😊
There's a special place in math hell for the makers of this question.
Love to get wrong 🎉
So 1 question = 18 minutes explanations☠️
In the grand scheme of all things that matter, "who cares?"
I choose  b) 3.
I paused the video.   I could be wrong.   I  thought  the circumference of B divided by the circumference of A.
First way was to give any value to the radius of B and solve for Circumference.  Then divide that value by 3 to get the radius of A and solve for Circumference. Then divide Circunference of B by that of A.
The second way I tried was just solve 
2pi(r)/[2pi *1/3(r)]   after canceling leaving you with 1/(1/3), which is 3!
Fingers crossed🤞🏾 playing the video to get the answer
But it is B. 3 and you are doing the equations for the area of a circle not its circumference which is Pi times the diameter. The ratio of one third means that it has to be three times the length of the circumference logically, case closed?
I acctually thought of it rotating before I calculated and found four but then four wasn't in the answers so I thought I was wrong until you said the question was wrong
I'm more confused as of this day.
h o l y  f u c k I had to stop and think about the problem alot for this video
Is this Einsteinian Relativity???
Isnt it crazy how a bunch of math equations can be expressed as "Original=n+1", especially in exponential forms
thumbnail does not say how any tie a will be turned
So wait, if you turn a circle inside out and then swap its axis so it’s rotating on the flat circle’s front side and turning on y axis while rotating on the # axis. Then  how many times would it rotate on the z axis if it only had 1 side? The opposite side would be an empty void with out dimension .?
According to the planetary gearing formula -- the planet also rotates around the sun one time, and that rotation must be added to the 3/1 ratio.  Hence the real ratio is actually 4/1, i.e. 4 planet rotations are required to circle the sun once.  In gearing the formula is:  (sun diameter/ planet diameter) +1.    3/1+1 = 4.
Another way to look at it -- if the circumference of the sun was laid flat, the planet would have to move 3x its circumference to travel the distance moving in a straight path.  Now assume the sun is a circle.  When you add the planet's distance from the center of the sun, the center of the planet sweeps a circle 4 times it's own circumference as it travels around the sun.  Hence it rotates 4 times.  I'm just a mechanical engineer. 😊  This question does not belong on a high school test.
I got 3 but it's 4 lol
3:28 as the top coin starts with the bottom, the bottom of the same coin does not return to it's starting point in 2 revolutions, but 1. your assumptions are wrong.
2Pi r….for the circumference of each circle. Divide the larger circumference by the smaller one…
does this have anything to do with the proof of the area of a sphere being 4•pi•r^2?
Sounds like it was a poorly designed and written question if so many people got it wrong. The entire point of these standardized tests is to measure capability. Sounds like it failed to measure anything with any semblance of accuracy. Also, name one time the average person will use any of these mathematical formulas or theories 😂
Relativity … in circles ??? 😮
Excellent video. Very well explained.
I am proud to say, I actually got this one correct! I also thought it was 3 at first, but I knew that wasn't correct (it could not be that easy if Veritasium made a whole video on the problem). I then figured out where I went wrong, and mathematically arrived at the same conclusions that are presented in the video. Horray! I suppose years of watching channels like this was good for something!
This video reminded me why I love math and physics!
Sorry, I disagree.  With your demonstrations, you have performed the equivalent of a visual "slight of hand."  First, distance is distance whether it is linear or curved.  Moving in a circular path does not "add" distance to the circumference in the form of rotation.  In your demonstrations with the coins and circles, what you did to add the apparent "extra" rotation was to divert the viewer from one point of reference to a different point of reference, creating the appearance of needing an extra revolution to get back to the starting point.  You initially demonstrated with the coins (same circumferences) that it takes 2 rotation of the coin around the fixed coin to return to the starting point.  However, your reference point was to have George Washington's head be upright at the starting point, then rotated it until it was upright again and stated that that was 1 rotation, which was only 1/2 of a rotation. You then continued to rotate the coin until his head was again upright, stating 2 rotations, which again was only 1/2 of a rotation.  You claimed 2 rotations, when in fact only 1 rotation was made.  The point of reference should be at the point of contact between the coins and not the top of Washington's head. Given this, at the starting point Washington's neck n the top coin is in relation to Washington's head in the bottom, fixed coin.  Watching the point of contact, it takes 1 rotation for Washington's neck to return to the top of Washington's head of the fixed coin.
The circumferences of the circles with the ratio of 3 to 1, are related by a factor of 3. You never did the math to show this (c=pi x 2r: Circle A : 3.14*2*1=6.28; Circle B: 3.14*2*3=18.81; 18.81/6.28=2.9952).  These distances do not change as a result of the motion of Circle A in a circular path around Circle B as you stated.  The "slight of hand" occurs as a result of your reference point, the letter "A" or the contact point of Circle A with Circle B.  You changed these to give the appearance that there is a real change.  You initially place the 3 o'clock position of Circle A, with the letter A at the 12 o'clock position, in contact with the 9 o'clock position of Circle B.  you then rotate Circle A to the 12 o'clock position of Circle B, stopping when the "A" is upright, counting this as "1." However, circle A only rotated 3/4 of a rotation. The 3 o'clock position of Circle A, the initial contact point, has not yet reached Circle B to complete the rotation, which should actually be labeled as "1."  Continuing in this manner, when the 3 o'clock position touches Circle B, not when the letter "A" is upright, Circle A will make only 3 rotations when the 3 o'clock position reaches the initial starting point of the 9 o'clock position of Circle B.
Center of the coin actually travels a distance of 2pi(R+r) so the rotations will be 2pi(R+r)/(2pi r) - similar to straight line travel on same distance
as usual in USA nobody cares till is an scandal... and it can take tenths of years
If it’s not 3 it’s gonna be for some stupid semantics.  Let’s see
IIT 2022 had same question...
When I saw the drawing I imagined the small circle going around the big one and I was sure the rotations were more than 3 and far below 6
My answers was 9/2 because I figured it had to be more than 3 and 6 seemed like too much.
Remember Spirograph?  That's how I came to know something was weird about circles and I never really grasped gears, but loved the designs it would come up with.  I was always interested in astronomy and considered I was a better than average mathematician but no, I fell for the intuitive answer.  Somewhere along the video I tweaked at 4pi.  Well, whaddya know?  I'm smart, but SLOW smart.  LOL!
Thanks for the video.. This has been my question from quite a while.. I ignored it back in the day, given the other work.. But this has always been in back of my head ❤❤
😮 I was dumbfounded when you were explaining this until I saw the perception of the smaller coin. It looks like it is rotating twice but it’s orientation of the quarter being head up doesn’t make it a full turn because the top of the coin is touching the second coin. It’s only a full rotation when the when the bottom of the coin which was the original starting point is touching the second coin.
English would call this appalling grammar
Hahaha. Nice one.
Commenting before the answer is revealed; I think it’s either 2 or 4, but can’t seem to work out which one. The ‘orbit’ around R3 would either add or subtract one rotation. I’m going to go with 4.
I think if the circle travels 2pir distance in one turn , the center too should travel a distance of 2pir , otherwise that would turn out to be a different circle , that won't happen ... 
So the total diatance it has to go with respect to point B is 8pir , and one turn is 2pir .. so 8pir/2pir =4
your video is very nice! please make some video Bengali
If you rotate your perspective in order to keep the coins side by side then one of those answers becomes correct..
Funny, I just looked at it and imagined it would take 4 rotations, but then noticed 4 wasn't an option so went with 3.

joeys a total disaster 
How many crimes has he been charged with?
This national issue has no place in state courts!
If anybody has any say in keeping a person off a national ballot it should be ELECTED legislators in the US Congress.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF ANY STATE DECIDED TO KEEP BIDEN OFF THE BALLOT?
I think the cult just doesn't want to admit they fell for his lies.
Really, how many times do you have to be told that Biden is not running this show? He doesn't even know who is president half the time. It's Obama and his leftovers that pull puppet Biden's strings.

10 words from Trump on a Twitter post would have stopped the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol in 10 minutes. 
People pleaded with him to call off his supporters - Cabinet members, family and members of Congress actually in the Capitol Building. 
He kept watching TV. 
He did nothing.
I can’t think of one thing I admire about Joe Biden… not one thing….
Sounds like another "perfect call" from Trump has surfaced.  Let's not talk about the real fraud elephant in the room.
Biden isn't about to stand up for the one guy who is guaranteed to stomp his guts out in the election.
When all was lost Japanese troops would conduct a suicidal Banzai charge.  You’re seeing the Democrat equivalent in Colorado.
Biden doesn't  have enough  control of the motor skills required to speak clearly .We need the SCOTUS  to speak for him
He'll do whatever his handlers tell him to. He doesn't decide anything. 
No interference from the Executive branch. Let the Courts do their job.
No politicization of the courts
There likely be an 8 to 1 ruling on this going either way.
Trust the courts.

In case nobody has noticed, Crooked Joe Biden and his puppeteers have flown the country into the ground.
Precedent confirms a criminal conviction is not required to be disqualified under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. No one who has been formally disqualified under Section 3 was charged under the criminal “rebellion or insurrection” statute (18 U.S.C. § 2383) or its predecessors.
Even if Trump wins the election Republicans would still need to amend our Constitution so Traitors can hold office.
Why would Biden get involved with this?

Biden will never do that. His heart and mind are so corrupted won't let him do the right thing.    
Democrat Socialists have done this before
Expecting Biden to stand up for what is right is like expecting a mute to speak. Biden must get marching orders from the Obamas, and the Obamas love chaos and a good crisis. That is how they win. They create issues, even false issues. Sadly, now we are dealing with their self-serving policies.
You also believed Obama was born in Kenya.

It's not up to Beijing Joe...nothing is.
why would he do that, it was probably his idea
Democrats and their shadowy philosophy have minority support. Only the propaganda media and their seeded operatives within the Globalist Cabal can leverage the illusion of progressive ideas eclipsing their actual regressive results (Carter, Clinton, Obama and Virtual Joe for recent examples). A Dec...
And its working, you notice the MAJORITY keep putting Democrats in office....
Presidents are NOT allowed to interfere in a states' elections no matter what your orange jesus told you.
Biden may be forced to do it, because of political pressures. But, he has ALWAYS been a partisan hack, and secretly loves what the court did. 
Presidents are NOT allowed to interfere in a states' elections no matter what your orange jesus told you. 
Colorado Judges= "We'll tell you who you can vote for."
Constitution refers to the president as an officer 25 times
don't like the constitution why?
tell us all
The Constitution actually does that. What you gonna do?
This decision is more of the unraveling of the democrat party in fear of losing power to common sense. 
This decision respects the Constitution of the United States of America.
It's an issue in at least a dozen states. It needs to go to the Supreme Court to make the decision. 
Try hats where we’ll see Gorsuch literally eat his own words 
Hey Trump...... tell us about this
Trump pressured Michigan canvassers not to certify 2020 election in recorded phone call
Link to the recording please so we can evaluate what was said. You guys have a history of twisting the truth.
Decolonization
a denouncement has no lawful effect.
But he ain’t smart or confident 
Accept he runs a sophisticated crime family, right?
Higher pay and strong hiring encouraged more people to get off the sidelines. The labor-force participation rate for workers between the ages of 25 and 54—83.3% in November—is trending near the highest rate in more than two decades.
Evil resides in our White House.
"Evil" got jettisoned in 2020.
sorry MAGA
AmericanSickOfBiden
I find it funny that one would even think for a moment, that Biden actually helped spearhead this.  Believe me, he knew about this before it happened.  This is actually another example of how corupt democrats are and this administration and our court system is.
You just kinda twisted yourself in knots. 
Insurrectionists don't deserve to campaign for POTUS 
Tell me you're afraid without saying the word. Beloved Biden Bot.
Alotta.Anger
Are the justices on the Colorado Supreme Court, elected, or appointed?  Term limited?
Dems just love those Nothing Burgers. Aren't they delicious? But at the end of the day you're hungry and feeling empty.
Why would he do that? Brandon (or O) probably put them up to it. 
why would he?
they followed the Constitution
They decided on their own that an insurrection occurred .... it didn't
of China
Does ANYONE think that if the rolls were reversed, Trump wouldn't be over the moon that Biden was removed from the ballot, and encouraging the rest of the states to do it as well? 
But that would mean Trump has a conscience
Anyone who expects Biden to denounce the court’s ruling is crazy. Biden will do anything to get re-elected. Biden is greedy and addicted to power. He’s also a puppet of China,and China is doing very well with Biden in the White House.
The Jan 6th protester broke a few windows and then wandered around the Capitol building talking to the police... how exactly was that a violent take over of the government
Ask Ashli Babbitt….Oh wait.
Exactly, Trump told them to go peacefully.  Then you have the looters during the summer of love where Kamala said they should not or will not stop.  
Growing calls from far right MAGA people. 
There fixed it. 
Making America great again is not a radical idea. Destroying America is a radical idea.
Ostrich.
We the People of United States of America  can stand up to remove 4 judges.. four judges broke oaths of US of constitution 
Cry some more MAGA tears.
let's_dothechickendance
This is a primary election issue, not a general election. This is a repub problem, let the repubs sort this out for themselves. It'll become a national issue when the general election cycle starts.
Ok then how about the red states remove Biden from their election rolls
That would require moral ballast. Biden clan has none.
Old Joe:  Thanks, Colorado, I need all the help I can get.
Pressing Biden to denounce Colorado's attempt to make his election more solid....really?
Biden knows the only way to beat President Trump is to take him off the ballot. So afraid of Trump, so sad are the democrats. 
He already beat Trump and that was before Trump committed treason. What makes you think voters will flip their vote to Trump after his actions? 
Biden's ONLY hope is to remove  Trump from the ballot
The best thing for the Dems is to have Trump on the general election ballot. Result will be same as 20. 
That's something that will never happen. Joe Biden can not make decisions on his own. The puppet will do whatever the staffers want him to say or do .
Make no mistake about it. This all is leading to a one party government and if we the people don't stand up to this we deserve it.
Written by a Constitutional lawyer and former GOP judge that was a consultant for the Trump WH on Jan 6. 
So, the Dem judges did not write it?
Election Fraud!!!!!!
Trump recorded pressuring Michigan canvassers not to certify 2020 election
democrats ordering that illegals be granted voting rights ( election fraud)
I wonder if these liberals will ever learn (hope not) everytime they do something like this to Trump it makes him stronger..
I know... right!
Every time trump faces the consequences of his actions that he refuses to take responsibility for, his followers love him even more.  
He tells men they can grab women without their consent, they love him more.
He lies to their faces and they love him more.
He undermines our electoral ...
Liberals don't learn from their mistakes, they just repeat them.
You’re living in a fantasy land calling for Joe Biden to denounce Colorado’s State Supreme Court ruling. Trump in the polls is beating him like a drum ! 
This is the GOP attempting a Jedi Mind Trick on Joe.
what mind?
Biden make a plea for actual justice?  He doesn’t have it in him. 
You mean a plea for trump to not have to abide by our constitution?
Let's not get it twisted
‘Democrat’ Party opposes democracy, which is a system where voters get to select their elected leaders,"
No dog, that's called an election. 
"Opposing Democracy" is pretending you won an election you lost, trying to discredit all the votes, even after everyone told you you los...
🎯 democrats oppose democracy at EVERY turn
I admit up front to two things!!!
I do not know if this is allowed in colorado, but if so, use the 'write in' to put him on the ballot.
And the other thing, yeah, I could have used da google to find out if 'write in' is an option, but it is too early and I have only had two cups of coffee!!!!!!!
I had to write in an intelligent person for the 2020 presidential election. I'm hoping there will be a choice for me in 24
Remove corrupt Joe from the Texas ballot!
He himself is a phony president he isn't about to go against the democrat party's wishes!
One way or another Biden will be the last Democratic candidate that plays nice and by the old rules.....if its an authoritarian you want that's what you'll get and the generation that grew up on Occupy Wall Street, Save the Planet now and Outlaw Guns will be the ones taking the shortcuts and breaki...
You expect a president who hasnt done ONE THING RIGHT TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME? 
President Biden won in a landslide and the country's economy is better than evee.
It’s interesting that Fox fails to mention that Republicans are actually the ones that sued Democrats to keep Trump off the ballot in Colorado. 
The case that led to the Colorado Supreme Court decision is named Anderson v. Griswold.
The 'Anderson' is former Republican state lawmaker Norma Anderson wh...
If Biden was removed from the ballot do you think Trump would denounce it?
If Trumps lawyer was pushing election lies about Georgia election workers do you think Trump would denounce it?
LOL.  Biden is NEVER going to end up on the ballot.  Not going to happen.   
Why would he denounce it when Republican Constitution scholars from the Federalist Society say Trump shouldn't be on the ballot?
No "constitution scholar"  believes in sanction before due process. Anyone who does isn't  worthy of a law degree.
Biden wouldn't pull a hair to stop them but he'll certainly encourage them and others to do the same. He knows it's the only chance he might have of winning 2024.
biden won't denounce the ruling because he knows cheating is the only way he can win and did win.
Democracy has NOTHING in common with Biden and the Liberal Left SOCIALIST Democrat Party !!! 
One Party control is the objective of Biden and the Liberal Left SOCIALIST Democrat Party !!!
Would police and firefighters be the result of this Socialist leaning? Asking for me, not a friend.
The people who staged an insurrection after they lost an election demand a do-over election.
What will they do if they lose that election?
He shouldn’t have lied about losing the election.  Everyone would’ve been happier 
You're confused. Brandon LIED about winning the election.
What about state rights? funny how that goes out the window when a Republican doesn't like the ruling
What does "states rights" have to do with denying due process? That's a U.S. Constitutional right?
Unfortunately Colorado turned blue and will remain blue no matter if Trump is on the ballot or not. No doubt this steady dose of Liberals is led by the Boulder contingent, who is one of the most woke places in the U.S.  
An insurrection is a violent take over of the government... how exactly was an unarmed unorganized protest mob going to take control of the government
Let Adam Schiff investigate this and find out the truth like he did with the Russia interference. He found unequivocal proof before. Oh wait. never mind.
Trump stands alone as the Most corrupt President in US History.  No one else comes close
Then why are you so afraid he may win?
biden by far is the most corrupt.
Dontcha think it’s a little too late for any dRAT to show any new colors?
He OKd .
Joe only cares about sniffing lil girls hair and chocolate chip ice cream cones .
Each day is a new low with Biden
Biden knows he has a poor chance against Trump. He won't do it.
When he loses he and his family get prosecuted. This he knows.
He'll answer as soon as Obama gets his marching orders and transmits them to Joes teleprompter...
I don't get it.  Was Trump convicted of committing insurrection?  How can these judges take him off the ballot using a crime he has never been convicted of?... 
....or even accused of.
easy, the dems do not follow the rules of law
Trump can end all of this today.
He just needs to share HIS Proof that HE PROMISED America to back up HIS CLAIMS of Election Fraud and Stolen Elections.
What’s the BIG Challenge in doing that? 
Biden cannot "think" beyond his next diaper change and pudding cup.
she means w/o stealing the election
he can win without throwing Trump off the ballot.
Why would Biden want to help Trump. He has announced to the media that " yes, he is an insurrectionist", plus compares Trump to Hitler. MAGA supporters are terrorists. The last thing Biden would do is stop the lies and help the man who is going to replace him in the W.H.
Ari Fleischer???? Oh, Fox, you’re killing me!!! Ha ha ha ha!! 
why does Joe's approval rating drop every time we attack Democracy ?
So, Trump told Michigan officials not to certify election results.  Where's that story?
Well obviously you heard about it. 
In your trailer park newsletter. 
The Democratic Socialistic Cult Party is destroying our Democracy.  You must think and do as they say.  History   has shown that this segment of society who want to silence opposing views are extremely dangerous to freedom.

Never forget you too can right click on a word for the definition.
Yep. It's easy to "win" if your top competitor is removed from the ballot!
He called Trump an insurrectionist! What are the odds?
What’s an even better way than harvesting to win an election? Support throwing the other guy off the ballot… I can’t think of a more anti-American way to wield success.
What I don't understand about this. Jan 6 nonsense is Trump is literally on record before that day and during that day, asking people to behave and stay in line. Yet liberals read his mind and come to a different conclusion. 
I mean, what could possibly go wrong with this plan
DOJ Warns States Not To Pursue Their Own Arizona-Style Election Audits August 4, 2021 The Biden U.S. Department of Justice is now telling states that they should not pursue their own Arizona-style election audits. The DOJ’s new guidance document claims that undertaking “partisan” election audits co...
he can't do that. give Trump any support?  no way
This entire 14th Amendment issue was started by members of the Federalist Society, the most Constitutionally clued in legal group in America.
Every one or the Republican appointed SC justices is or was a member of the Federalist Society.
It is going to the Supreme Court. Let them decide.
And Biden and his Socialist-Marxists encouraged neverending protests and harassment at the residences of those he disagreed with on the SCOTUS.  Imagine that... the sitting US president encouraged his followers to go after the families of those he and people like "XXXX Maxi-Pad" Maxine WATERS didn'...See more
Why would he do that? Joe Biden is part of the cabal that’ll do whatever it takes to remove Trump from the ballot.
Hey Dems! This is what election interference looks like. 
Hey MAGA! This is what being held accountable for your crimes looks like.
The left's fear of President Trump is unprecedented . We have Russia hoaxes , 2 failed impeachments , classified document scams ,  Jan 6 sham trials , And the current trials for supposed crimes which not surprisingly have no victims. Now we have rouge states attempting to exclude him from the ballo...
Majority. 54% say they agree with dumping Trump off the ballot.
With only 25% of the state being registered as a Republican, they really don’t have a voice in Colorado. 
That sounds like a GOP problem, not a Democrat problem.
Colorado just spoke for the US Constitution.
Socialists believe in winning at all costs.  The ends always justify the means.  
Biden is the best Democrats have.
Biden has made decades of racist comments and votes. Biden continues to make racist comments.
Biden is guilty of quid pro quo with Ukraine, which he admits on video.
Biden showered with his daughter when she was a child.
Biden’s policies have soured a lot of voters.
No ...
Jan.6th was nothing more than a Mardi Gras party..Trump won the election leading by hundred's of thousands of votes across the midwest at 2AM only to lose the election by 5:30 AM when all the forged paper ballots were dumped into the system.. we all know it
So why did Trumps own attorney general say that didn't happen. 
Desperate ploy by the GOP. Like saying, "Oh, this is going to backfire".
Well., let's just see. Let the State Rights play out.
Still don’t get how an old geezer who hid out in his basement won the last election. 
and where are all of his proud fans?
Democrat Operative: "Mr. President... you have served your party well but now it's time for you to step aside for a younger generation to take the reigns"
Biden: "Get off of my lawn!!"
lol
Why would he denounce it?  Cheating and lying is their thing. They care about winning and power, nothing else, and they don't care what they do or who they hurt to get it. It's really reaching unbelievable porportions. 
Yeah I remember when the democrats staged an insurrection after they lost an election..oh wait ...that was your side.
Truth.
Pressure from who? Republicans? 
You can’t try to steal the election; then attack the country.  Take your wokeness out of this country.  
Please.  It’s like asking him to denounce stolen elections.  He knows he’s illegitimate, along with most other Dems.
SC will rule in favor against Colorado Court. 
What about trumps birther lies about Obama?   Did Obama stomp his feet and whine like a baby?  What about yelling about lock her up?   What about insulting Ted Cruz for "cheating in the Iowa primary"?   trump just can't take the heat.  Everyone else handles it like a man.  trump acts like a baby.
one might be asking for this from a man with hate in his heart
Hilarious! Biden's handlers came up with this idea and now someone is suggesting that Slow Joe denounce it? This leftist media machine is comical as well !
His handlers won’t let him…. 
SCOTUS will overturn this and end this Liberal Madness.
solipsism-is-overrated
Gorsuch agrees with Colorado Supreme Court.
"Judge Gorsuch said, it is “'a state's legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process' that 'permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office'"
No he’s not, all made up - Mr Trump ( soon prisoner #4567) committed an act against this country that he is now paying the price for - that’s sweet justice 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Tyrannical left!
Trump has not been convicted of any crimes! However, Biden has aided our foreign enemies! Under the 14th amendment, he cannot be on any ballot in the United States!
Hey Republicans! 
How Exactly was Donald Trump Defending and Protecting the US Constitution on J-6, that he SWORE his Sacred Oath of Office to Defend and Protect?
Does no Republican have the COURAGE to Reply?
Merry Christmas ---take a holiday from the hating---you can start again on Tuesday!!!
He has not been charged with or convicted of insurrection and that's why these partisan judges voted this way. The other three did not and one was very vocal that it was wrong.
He won’t denounce it, he welcomes it.
lol. Biden should act like a statesman? That's rich.
Unlike Cheeto, this President believes in Separation of Powers and letting the Process work. Take Note Cheeto!
Yeah, sure. Not. If he did, he wouldn't have said, "But he certainly supported an insurrection. No question about it. None. Zero." Not only are there questions about it, nowhere has he been charged with insurrection. President has now appointed himself prosecutor, judge, and jury.
There's a recording': Internet explodes over audio showing Trump's 2020 pressure campaign
Trump on Thursday was accused of having "personally pressured" at least two Republicans to unlawfully block the 2020 election results, and social media is exploding with comments on the audio recording.
He’s going to jail.
Who out there honestly believes Jan 6 was an insurrection. I mean seriously. Not for political purposes. But actually a true insurrection?
Do you routinely bring a gallows to listen to a speach?
Everyone except for Trumps MAGA base. 
Soooo, all right wing political hacks are calling for Biden to do this? Lol. Okay. Good try. I’m glad we actually follow what’s written in the constitution. These people must be afraid of Trump getting the boot.
Actually, Donald Trump getting the boot in all 50 would only help Republicans' chances in 2024 elections.  Those of us who actually think (and there are plenty who don't on both sides) recognized that.
Slow walk the criminal charges, fast track the Colorado ballot question? trump hypocrisy at its finest.
We have the best economy in decades because of Democrats policies and the Republican candidate for president is not eligible to run.
Today opposite day?
just remember ..... a vote for anyone other than trump in 2024 is a vote for biden. OUCH ! the ship will sink
At this point more realistically Harris. Biden is in freefall both on his physical and mental health.
