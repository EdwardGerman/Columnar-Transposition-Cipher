Ronalds Of The Bennals, The
     In Tarbolton, ye ken, there are proper young men,
     And proper young lasses and a', man;
     But ken ye the Ronalds that live in the Bennals,
     They carry the gree frae them a', man.

     Their father's laird, and weel he can spare't,
     Braid money to tocher them a', man;
     To proper young men, he'll clink in the hand
     Gowd guineas a hunder or twa, man.

     There's ane they ca' Jean, I'll warrant ye've seen
     As bonie a lass or as braw, man;
     But for sense and guid taste she'll vie wi' the best,
     And a conduct that beautifies a', man.

     The charms o' the min', the langer they shine,
     The mair admiration they draw, man;
     While peaches and cherries, and roses and lilies,
     They fade and they wither awa, man,

     If ye be for Miss Jean, tak this frae a frien',
     A hint o' a rival or twa, man;
     The Laird o' Blackbyre wad gang through the fire,
     If that wad entice her awa, man.

     The Laird o' Braehead has been on his speed,
     For mair than a towmond or twa, man;
     The Laird o' the Ford will straught on a board,
     If he canna get her at a', man.

     Then Anna comes in, the pride o' her kin,
     The boast of our bachelors a', man:
     Sae sonsy and sweet, sae fully complete,
     She steals our affections awa, man.

     If I should detail the pick and the wale
     O' lasses that live here awa, man,
     The fau't wad be mine if they didna shine
     The sweetest and best o' them a', man.

     I lo'e her mysel, but darena weel tell,
     My poverty keeps me in awe, man;
     For making o' rhymes, and working at times,
     Does little or naething at a', man.

     Yet I wadna choose to let her refuse,
     Nor hae't in her power to say na, man:
     For though I be poor, unnoticed, obscure,
     My stomach's as proud as them a', man.

     Though I canna ride in weel-booted pride,
     And flee o'er the hills like a craw, man,
     I can haud up my head wi' the best o' the breed,
     Though fluttering ever so braw, man.

     My coat and my vest, they are Scotch o' the best,
     O'pairs o' guid breeks I hae twa, man;
     And stockings and pumps to put on my stumps,
     And ne'er a wrang steek in them a', man.

     My sarks they are few, but five o' them new,
     Twal' hundred, as white as the snaw, man,
     A ten-shillings hat, a Holland cravat;
     There are no mony poets sae braw, man.

     I never had frien's weel stockit in means,
     To leave me a hundred or twa, man;
     Nae weel-tocher'd aunts, to wait on their drants,
     And wish them in hell for it a', man.

     I never was cannie for hoarding o' money,
     Or claughtin't together at a', man;
     I've little to spend, and naething to lend,
     But deevil a shilling I awe, man.





Song—Here's To Thy Health
     Tune—“Laggan Burn.”
 
     Here's to thy health, my bonie lass,
     Gude nicht and joy be wi' thee;
     I'll come nae mair to thy bower-door,
     To tell thee that I lo'e thee.
     O dinna think, my pretty pink,
     But I can live without thee:
     I vow and swear I dinna care,
     How lang ye look about ye.

     Thou'rt aye sae free informing me,
     Thou hast nae mind to marry;
     I'll be as free informing thee,
     Nae time hae I to tarry:
     I ken thy frien's try ilka means
     Frae wedlock to delay thee;
     Depending on some higher chance,
     But fortune may betray thee.

     I ken they scorn my low estate,
     But that does never grieve me;
     For I'm as free as any he;
     Sma' siller will relieve me.
     I'll count my health my greatest wealth,
     Sae lang as I'll enjoy it;
     I'll fear nae scant, I'll bode nae want,
     As lang's I get employment.

     But far off fowls hae feathers fair,
     And, aye until ye try them,
     Tho' they seem fair, still have a care;
     They may prove waur than I am.
     But at twal' at night, when the moon shines bright,
     My dear, I'll come and see thee;
     For the man that loves his mistress weel,
     Nae travel makes him weary.





Lass Of Cessnock Banks, The^1
     [Footnote 1: The lass is identified as Ellison Begbie, a servant
      wench, daughter of a  “Farmer Lang”.]

     A Song of Similes

     Tune—“If he be a Butcher neat and trim.”
 
     On Cessnock banks a lassie dwells;
     Could I describe her shape and mein;
     Our lasses a' she far excels,
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     She's sweeter than the morning dawn,
     When rising Phoebus first is seen,
     And dew-drops twinkle o'er the lawn;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     She's stately like yon youthful ash,
     That grows the cowslip braes between,
     And drinks the stream with vigour fresh;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     She's spotless like the flow'ring thorn,
     With flow'rs so white and leaves so green,
     When purest in the dewy morn;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her looks are like the vernal May,
     When ev'ning Phoebus shines serene,
     While birds rejoice on every spray;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her hair is like the curling mist,
     That climbs the mountain-sides at e'en,
     When flow'r-reviving rains are past;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her forehead's like the show'ry bow,
     When gleaming sunbeams intervene
     And gild the distant mountain's brow;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her cheeks are like yon crimson gem,
     The pride of all the flowery scene,
     Just opening on its thorny stem;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her bosom's like the nightly snow,
     When pale the morning rises keen,
     While hid the murm'ring streamlets flow;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her lips are like yon cherries ripe,
     That sunny walls from Boreas screen;
     They tempt the taste and charm the sight;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her teeth are like a flock of sheep,
     With fleeces newly washen clean,
     That slowly mount the rising steep;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her breath is like the fragrant breeze,
     That gently stirs the blossom'd bean,
     When Phoebus sinks behind the seas;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     Her voice is like the ev'ning thrush,
     That sings on Cessnock banks unseen,
     While his mate sits nestling in the bush;
     An' she has twa sparkling roguish een.

     But it's not her air, her form, her face,
     Tho' matching beauty's fabled queen;
     'Tis the mind that shines in ev'ry grace,
     An' chiefly in her roguish een.





Song—Bonie Peggy Alison
     Tune—“The Braes o' Balquhidder.”
 
     Chor.—And I'll kiss thee yet, yet,
     And I'll kiss thee o'er again:
     And I'll kiss thee yet, yet,
     My bonie Peggy Alison.

     Ilk care and fear, when thou art near
     I evermair defy them, O!
     Young kings upon their hansel throne
     Are no sae blest as I am, O!
     And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, &c.

     When in my arms, wi' a' thy charms,
     I clasp my countless treasure, O!
     I seek nae mair o' Heaven to share
     Than sic a moment's pleasure, O!
     And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, &c.

     And by thy een sae bonie blue,
     I swear I'm thine for ever, O!
     And on thy lips I seal my vow,
     And break it shall I never, O!
     And I'll kiss thee yet, yet, &c.





Song—Mary Morison
     Tune—“Bide ye yet.”

     O Mary, at thy window be,
     It is the wish'd, the trysted hour!
     Those smiles and glances let me see,
     That make the miser's treasure poor:
     How blythely was I bide the stour,
     A weary slave frae sun to sun,
     Could I the rich reward secure,
     The lovely Mary Morison.

     Yestreen, when to the trembling string
     The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha',
     To thee my fancy took its wing,
     I sat, but neither heard nor saw:
     Tho' this was fair, and that was braw,
     And yon the toast of a' the town,
     I sigh'd, and said among them a',
     “Ye are na Mary Morison.”

     Oh, Mary, canst thou wreck his peace,
     Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?
     Or canst thou break that heart of his,
     Whase only faut is loving thee?
     If love for love thou wilt na gie,
     At least be pity to me shown;
     A thought ungentle canna be
     The thought o' Mary Morison.

Winter: A Dirge
     The wintry west extends his blast,
     And hail and rain does blaw;
     Or the stormy north sends driving forth
     The blinding sleet and snaw:
     While, tumbling brown, the burn comes down,
     And roars frae bank to brae;
     And bird and beast in covert rest,
     And pass the heartless day.

     “The sweeping blast, the sky o'ercast,”
      The joyless winter day
     Let others fear, to me more dear
     Than all the pride of May:
     The tempest's howl, it soothes my soul,
     My griefs it seems to join;
     The leafless trees my fancy please,
     Their fate resembles mine!

     Thou Power Supreme, whose mighty scheme
     These woes of mine fulfil,
     Here firm I rest; they must be best,
     Because they are Thy will!
     Then all I want—O do Thou grant
     This one request of mine!—
     Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,
     Assist me to resign.





Prayer, Under The Pressure Of Violent Anguish
     O Thou Great Being! what Thou art,
     Surpasses me to know;
     Yet sure I am, that known to Thee
     Are all Thy works below.

     Thy creature here before Thee stands,
     All wretched and distrest;
     Yet sure those ills that wring my soul
     Obey Thy high behest.

     Sure, Thou, Almighty, canst not act
     From cruelty or wrath!
     O, free my weary eyes from tears,
     Or close them fast in death!

     But, if I must afflicted be,
     To suit some wise design,
     Then man my soul with firm resolves,
     To bear and not repine!





Paraphrase Of The First Psalm
     The man, in life wherever plac'd,
     Hath happiness in store,
     Who walks not in the wicked's way,
     Nor learns their guilty lore!

     Nor from the seat of scornful pride
     Casts forth his eyes abroad,
     But with humility and awe
     Still walks before his God.

     That man shall flourish like the trees,
     Which by the streamlets grow;
     The fruitful top is spread on high,
     And firm the root below.

     But he whose blossom buds in guilt
     Shall to the ground be cast,
     And, like the rootless stubble, tost
     Before the sweeping blast.

     For why? that God the good adore,
     Hath giv'n them peace and rest,
     But hath decreed that wicked men
     Shall ne'er be truly blest.





First Six Verses Of The Ninetieth Psalm Versified, The
     O Thou, the first, the greatest friend
     Of all the human race!
     Whose strong right hand has ever been
     Their stay and dwelling place!

     Before the mountains heav'd their heads
     Beneath Thy forming hand,
     Before this ponderous globe itself
     Arose at Thy command;

     That Pow'r which rais'd and still upholds
     This universal frame,
     From countless, unbeginning time
     Was ever still the same.

     Those mighty periods of years
     Which seem to us so vast,
     Appear no more before Thy sight
     Than yesterday that's past.

     Thou giv'st the word: Thy creature, man,
     Is to existence brought;
     Again Thou say'st, “Ye sons of men,
     Return ye into nought!”

     Thou layest them, with all their cares,
     In everlasting sleep;
     As with a flood Thou tak'st them off
     With overwhelming sweep.

     They flourish like the morning flow'r,
     In beauty's pride array'd;
     But long ere night cut down it lies
     All wither'd and decay'd.





Prayer, In The Prospect Of Death
     O Thou unknown, Almighty Cause
     Of all my hope and fear!
     In whose dread presence, ere an hour,
     Perhaps I must appear!

     If I have wander'd in those paths
     Of life I ought to shun,
     As something, loudly, in my breast,
     Remonstrates I have done;

     Thou know'st that Thou hast formed me
     With passions wild and strong;
     And list'ning to their witching voice
     Has often led me wrong.

     Where human weakness has come short,
     Or frailty stept aside,
     Do Thou, All-Good—for such Thou art—
     In shades of darkness hide.

     Where with intention I have err'd,
     No other plea I have,
     But, Thou art good; and Goodness still
     Delighteth to forgive.





Stanzas, On The Same Occasion
     Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene?
     Have I so found it full of pleasing charms?
     Some drops of joy with draughts of ill between—
     Some gleams of sunshine 'mid renewing storms,
     Is it departing pangs my soul alarms?
     Or death's unlovely, dreary, dark abode?
     For guilt, for guilt, my terrors are in arms:
     I tremble to approach an angry God,
     And justly smart beneath His sin-avenging rod.

     Fain would I say, “Forgive my foul offence,”
      Fain promise never more to disobey;
     But, should my Author health again dispense,
     Again I might desert fair virtue's way;
     Again in folly's part might go astray;
     Again exalt the brute and sink the man;
     Then how should I for heavenly mercy pray
     Who act so counter heavenly mercy's plan?
     Who sin so oft have mourn'd, yet to temptation ran?

     O Thou, great Governor of all below!
     If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee,
     Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow,
     Or still the tumult of the raging sea:
     With that controlling pow'r assist ev'n me,
     Those headlong furious passions to confine,
     For all unfit I feel my pow'rs to be,
     To rule their torrent in th' allowed line;
     O, aid me with Thy help, Omnipotence Divine!
