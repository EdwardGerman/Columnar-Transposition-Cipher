The Eye Of The Storm

[Instrumental]


  
Immortalized

This is wartime, this is our time
We won't be denied
Feed the fire that is raging inside
This is go time, this is showtime
We will fight 'til their wills are broken
This is game time, an insane time
Let the madness fly
Show them strength that just can't be defied
Find the power to devour
Let the beast inside now be woken

In this world only the strong will survive
Hear the roar and you will know you're alive
Feel the energy build in your soul 'cause it's time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

Raw emotion, pure devotion
They will testify
And our memory will endure for all time
Never hiding, no dividing
Let them witness us move as one now
Show no mercy, let the world see
We're invincible
Show them nothing is beyond our control
Take it higher, our desire
Will determine what we've become now

Are you ready for the test of your life?
See the fear bleeding right through their eyes
Feel the energy build in your soul 'cause it's time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized

Feel it, take no prisoners now
Take it, there it is standing in front of us
Hear it, our deliverance now
Own it, give them all an image of us that will last for all time

Oh, in the calm before the storm
Another legend will be born
Another battle will be won
We will rise
Oh, so heed the call of confrontation
Today we feed on domination
Secure a legacy that will never die
Be immortalized



The Vengeful One

He is observing the chaos, taking in the lack of raw humanity
It's as if the entire world's fallen in love with their insanity
Hear the innocent voices scream
As their tormentors laugh through all of it
No forgiveness from all I've seen
The degradation I cannot forget

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
For judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

As the violence surges
And the teeming masses have been terrorized
The human predators all gone mad
Are reaping profits born from their demise
The rabid media plays their roles
Stoking the flames of war to no surprise
Only too eager to sell their souls
For the apocalypse must be televised

So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
Judgement falls upon you at first light

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

When you die
You'll know why
For you cannot be saved
With all the world enslaved
When you die
You'll know why

You'll die
You'll know why
For you cannot be saved
This world is too depraved
When you die
You'll know why

I'm the hand of God
I'm the dark messiah
I'm the vengeful one
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)
In the blackest moment of a dying world
What have you become
(Look inside and see what you're becoming)

Open Your Eyes

You're paralyzed with your disguise
You feed on the lies when they tell you
Gotta break away from the numbing pain
Succumb to the rage that's inside you
You're hypnotized demoralized
Believe every lie that they sell you
Start channelling whatever will remains
Discern from what's fiction and what is true

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

You've lost your sense from the emptiness
You do as the headlines compel you
Come whole again and let the war begin
Destroy the veneer that surrounds you
There's no defense for your recklessness
You stare as the proof lies before you
Why can't you see, are you afraid to be
Exposed to the demons around you?

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

You would all be runnin'
In a world you cannot hide
That the end is comin'
For the limping standing in line
Overcoming
Let the fury build inside
It can all be broken
If you'd only open your eyes

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
See through the disguise
Won't you open your eyes!


 
The Light

Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy,
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
Turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You wait and hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow reckoning
Then your fears seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away

When you think all is forsaken,
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't' where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid to turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind and
Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory

When you think all is forsaken,
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

Sickening weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
ignite the fire within you

When you think all is forsaken,
Listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

Don't ignore, listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes darkness
Can show you the light



What Are You Waiting For

So what you waiting for?
So what you waiting for?

I have never compromised
I never gave in
And so I have welcomed every challenge in my life
And I have never wandered blind
I'm led by hunger
And so I savor every drop each minute I'm alive

Leave nothing left behind

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Don't stand by and deny it
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Let them all be reminded

Don't let them undermine
Your dreams can never be stolen
Don't leave them stagnant rotting on the vine
Say goodbye to anyone who tries
To bleed you dry, you will show them
You're blessed with an unlimited supply

Leave nothing left behind

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Don't stand by and deny it
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Let them all be reminded

(So what you waiting for?)

So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Don't stand by and deny it
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Break new ground and defy it
Don't let the world outside
Leave you cornered and alone
So what you waiting for?
Tell me what you waiting for
Let them all be reminded

So what you waiting for?
So what you waiting for?


 
You're Mine

I've begun to realize
That whenever I am with you
You deliver me from the pain
In my life
Easy now to recognize
All the misery I have been through
It was beating me to submission
Till the day you arrived
Certainly, I felt alive
Strength I had lost was revived
I'm mending inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're
Mine
I knew I could be whole if you were
Mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're
Mine

Been betrayed too many times
Didn't think I would ever recover
That it'd haunt me for the rest of my life
Then you opened up my eyes
And you helped me rediscover
With what you resurrected
A man who had died
Your power regave me new life
Made me reborn and refined
Rebuilt from inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're
Mine
I knew I could be whole if you were
Mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're
Mine

I never thought I would ever escape
At times, I wanted to die
Feared that it all was just a little too late
For then I wouldn't survive
I let you in and let go of the hate
My heart recovered now, I
Owe you a debt that I can never repay
I still believe
'Cause you're mine
I'm burning inside
And we both know why

'Cause you're mine
I knew I could be whole if you were
Mine
I'll vanquish any foe because you're
Mine
I can regain control because you're
Mine
I can take over the world because you're
Mine
Mine


 
Who

Who! Who!
Who! Who!
Who! Who!
Who! Who!

You once were someone I could dignify (Ah! Ah!)
A guiding force, in which I thought could rely
I watched as you began to metamorphosize (Ah!)
Can't face it anymore, it's eating me alive

I'm not able to recognize
Where does the answer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who! Who! Who the hell are you?
Who! Who! Who the f*ck are you?

You were someone in whom I could confide (Ah! Ah!)
But you pushed me further away with every single lie
You used to have a soul, but it has surely died (Ah!)
What happened? When did you turn to the other side?

No longer able to recognize
For every word's a lie
You are forever changed
Ant there's nothing more that I can do

Who! Who! Who the hell are you?
Who! Who! Who the f*ck are you?

Oh!

You and I, we were once so...
You and I, it was once incredible
You and I, we were once so...
You and I, we were indivisible

You and I, were once two of a kind
Where did all your innocence go?
Now I wonder how it happened

That you and I, we were once so...
You and I, we were once inseparable
You and I, we were once like Gemini
It was undeniable

You and I, we were once two of a kind
Where did my deliverance go?
Can there be a mend to this divide?

I'm not able to recognize
Where does the answer lie?
You're no longer the same
Is there nothing more that I can do?

Who! Who! Who the hell are you?
Who! Who! Who the f*ck are you?

(Where does the answer lie?
Where does the answer lie?
It is eating me alive)
Who! Who! Who the f*ck are you?

(Where does the answer lie?
Where does the answer lie?
It is eating me alive)
Who! Who! Who the f*ck are you?

Who! Who!
Who the f*ck are you?

Who! Who!
Who the f*ck are you?



Save Our Last Goodbye

"Hello?"
"Please leave a message after the tone"
"Hey just calling you back doing pretty good today actually, didn't throw up at all.
Yeah tomorrow I got this procedure, I think everything's gonna go smooth there is all.
I'm hoping anyways. I need some good news for once."

Don't want to hear it's over
What a rude awakening
The angel of death has come
And ripped you from my lives
I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you
On the other side

Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
And those shards of doubt
Begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss
Are tearing me apart

Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

"We're sorry, this mailbox is full and can not taking messages"

My world is shattered, in disarray
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say in time the pain goes away
But in my soul it will forever stay

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore

"We're sorry, you've reached a number that is no longer in service"



Fire It Up

When I need to spark a bit of inspiration
and the melody feels like it's trapped inside
all I need is a bit of illumination
so the rhythm can no longer run and hide.
When I take a puff from the leaves of the devil
and it carries me on the other side

Fire it up, I like to fire it up
and it feels so right
Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
I feel like serenity... is mine

When I need a little bit of relaxation
my medicine isn't too hard to find
When I'm looking for a bit rejuvenation
I only partake of the finest kind
And then the mystery begins to unravel
and it helps me break through to the other side

Fire it up, I like to fire it up
and it feels so right
Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
I feel like serenity... is mine

Fire it up, fire it up

Fire it up
Fire it up, I like to fire it up
and it feels so right
Fire it up, 'cause when I fire it up
I feel like serenity
I feel like serenity... is mine


 
The Sound Of Silence

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening

People writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools" said I, "you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach to you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out it's warning
And the words that it was forming

And the sign said
"The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sound of silence



Never Wrong

You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never
No, you're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong

You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never
No, you're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong

You're never ever wrong, always something more to say
You're never wrong, will you never mind, let me fight
You're never wrong, if there's something more to say
You're never wrong, it' s going to end this time
You're never wrong, if you can never be contained
You're never wrong, will you never mind, let me fight
You're never wrong, don't even bother to explain
You're never wrong, you'll never win this time

Feel the anger coming, fell my patience running
Well it's plain to see that you have lost your damn mind

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another f*cking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone,
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall because I'm walking away

You're never ever wrong and you never will believe
That you were wrong, you're just never mind, let me fight
You're never wrong, were you really that deceived
The illusion is to end this time
Well you were wrong, I know its difficult to see
That you were wrong, in your little mind every time
Yeah you were wrong and now you'd better believe
That it is coming to an end this time

Feel the anger coming, fell the patience running
And it's easy to see you've made me lose my damn mind

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another f*cking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone,
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall because I'm walking away

If shut your mouth, then we just might make it
You wanna fight me, be careful what your wishing for
So say it again, push it again
There is no coming back this time

Shut your mouth, cause I just cant take it
I'm ready to fight, is it all that you were hoping for
Don't say it again, do it again
There'll be no coming back this time

How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another f*cking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall because I'm walking away
How could you let it end up this way
Is there really nothing more you can say
I'm not taking another f*cking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So just keep on talking to the wall because I'm walking away

You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong
You're never ever wrong, no you're never wrong, never wrong



Who Taught You How To Hate

I hear the voices echoing around me
Angered eyes that don't even know who I am
Looking to kill again (They will kill again)
As the unknown enemies surround me
Wicked laughter resonates inside my head
And I am filled with dread (And adrenaline)
What did I do? Why do I deserve this?
So we're different,
why do I deserve to die now?
Give my a reason why?

Then it all goes a blur
Let instinct take flight
Find my hands on his throat
Yet hear myself say

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate?
Because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way, you become
Dead to everyone

A father's pride, my son walking beside me
I look around and marvel how the children play
In perfect disarray (So innocent)
No judgement, pure exhilaration
Black to white, the colors aren't on their minds
Nothing predefined (All different)
There's always one who plants an evil seed and
Preaches fear to pull you to the other side
Into a world of lies

Everything is unsure when you've lost your sight
Can there still be a cure?
What made you this way?

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate?
Because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way, you become
Dead to everyone

(You're not anyone)
Oh

Lost all innocence
Infected and arrogant
You burn all your life
(There's no telling you)
No deliverance
Consumed by the pestilence
Of hate, you're denied
Deep in your heart does it still remain?
Do you think you can bring it
Back to life again?
Is it still in your soul?
(No saving you)
Where's the deviant
The unholy revenant
That has made you this way?
Made you fall for this hate

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate?
Because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way, you become
(You become)

Tell me now, who taught you how to hate?
Because it isn't in your blood
Not a part of what you're made
So let this be understood
Somebody taught you how to hate
When you live this way, you become
(You become)
Dead to everyone
(You're not anyone)



Tyrant

(Deluxe Edition Bonus Track)

Can we make amends, do we just pretend
That we're over all the violence
Are we done with this? Put it all to rest
Turn the screams now into silence
Will you be a man? Can you make a stand?
Will you own up or deny it all?
All the time we lost, was it worth the cost
Of breaking a family in two?
Destroyed all we knew

A tyrant, so defiant
Lonely as your heart is sinking
Consequences, no defenses
If only you had been thinking
Compliant, for a moment
Why did both of us have to believe that we were right?
Tyrant!

Can I clear my mind? Leave it all behind
Start to pick up all the pieces
Can I hide the scars? Just like prison bars
That have always seemed to confine me
Will we save it all? Even from the fall
Is there time left for revival
Can I be convinced that some hope exists?
With these wounds cut so deep in my soul
Can we become whole?

A tyrant, so defiant
Lonely as your heart is sinking
Consequences, no defenses
If only you had been thinking
Compliant, for a moment
Why did both of us have to believe that we were right?
Tyrant!

There's so many things that I wanted to say
But the love turned to hate we kept pushing away
And the words that came out turned it into a mess
And it's like pulling teeth cause you'll never confess
Now the damage is done
The hurt and the pain when nobody has won
Have we forgot it's your blood inside of my veins
That feeds my heart

A tyrant, so defiant
Lonely as your heart is sinking
Consequences, no defenses
If only you had been thinking
Compliant, for a moment
Why did both of us have to believe that we were right?
Tyrant!



Legion Of The Monsters

(Deluxe Edition Bonus Track)

The monster shattered the day
In a place where innocents play
I was mourning as the headlines shouted his name
They didn't waste any time
I was disgusted when the madman's image appeared at the top of the screen
Some were barely alive,
Too many didn't survive
Still they kept repeating headlines shouting the name
Do they not realize
The future demons with the hope of becoming the one at the top of the screen?

They've thrown morality away
With such depravity, I must say
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life

The pictures drove me insane
Can't get them out of my brain
You made certain they were right at the top of the page
You disrespected the dead
When the only name was of the one who committed the murder at the top of the page
The madman watching with glee
As the herd of innocents flee
They saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen
Perhaps they could be the one
Who'd become famous for the acts of terror reflected on the face of the screen?

You've thrown morality away
With such depravity, I must say
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane
The damage you caused, you cannot rectify
You've inspired new legions of monsters determined to take more life

Take a look around
Listen to the sound
Feel it on the ground
Fear has come in a wave
Just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave
Listen to me now
Are you with me now
Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
Lets defy them

Take a look around
Listen to the sound
Feel it on the ground
Fear has come in a wave
Just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave
Listen to me now
Are you with me now
Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
Lets defy them

You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane
The damage you caused you cannot rectify
You've inspired new legions of monsters determined to take more life

The monster shattered the day
The monster shattered the day
You're giving a legion of monsters a reason


 
The Brave And The Bold

(Deluxe Edition Bonus Track)

All your life you just stood there questioning
Feeling your ambition crumble away
As the power within you began to decay
Never finding what you were searching for
And feeling a longing you couldn't ignore
You felt it ache inside like never before

Take the path that the weak ones demonize
Look around and begin to realize

That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight

The burden you bear can cripple you
A ravenous cancer, eating your soul
Lost within a world beyond your control
So tonight, let there be a reckoning
Let this moment empower you to no end
Let the doubts within you, start to descend

Take the path that the weak ones demonize
Look around and begin to realize

That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight

That you're no longer alone tonight
Become the heir to the throne tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight

That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight


 
Warning Sign

(Digital Bonus Track)

Do you want this?
Do you need this?
You know you want this
You'll feed on what we decide
You really want this
You really need this
You know you'll want to
Listen close to what's specified
Yeah, you want this
Yeah, you need this
Don't you want to be
A part of the trend this time?

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside

Do you want this?
Do you need this?
You know you want to
Be a part of the winning side
You really want this
You really need this
I know you want to be
A part of the dignified
Damn you want this
Damn you need this
Damn you for falling
For an existence so contrived

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside

So let this serve as a reminder
A warning sign
You lost control of your mind
With no one inside
