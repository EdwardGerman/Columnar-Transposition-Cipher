genesis parashat bereishit the seven days of creation in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now the earth was formless and empty with darkness over the surface of the deep and gods wind was hovering over the surface of the waters god said let there be light and there was light god saw that the light was good and god divided the light from the darkness god called the light day and the darkness he called night there was evening and there was morning a first day p god said let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters and let it divide water from water god made the expanse and divided the water which was under the expanse from the water which was above the expanse and it was so god called the expanse heaven there was evening and there was morning a second day p god said let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place and let the dry land appear and it was so god called the dry land earth and the gathering of the waters he called seas and god saw that it was good god said let the earth yield grass herbs yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind with its seed in it on the earth and it was so the earth yielded grass herbs yielding seed after their kind and trees bearing fruit with its seed in it after their kind and god saw that it was good there was evening and there was morning a third day p god said let there be lights in the expanse of heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be signs for the seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the expanse of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so god made the two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars god set them in the expanse of heaven to give light to the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good there was evening and there was morning a fourth day p god said let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth in the expanse of heaven god created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves with which the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged bird after its kind god saw that it was good god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the birds multiply on the earth there was evening and there was morning a fifth day p god said let the earth produce living creatures after their kind livestock creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind and it was so god made the beasts of the earth after their kind and the livestock after their kind and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind and god saw that it was good god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth god created the man in his image in gods image he created him male and female he created them god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth god said behold i have given you every herb yielding seed on the surface of all the earth and every tree bearing fruit yielding seed it will be yours for food to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth in which there is the breath of life i have given every green herb for food and it was so god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good there was evening and there was morning the sixth day p the heavens and the earth were finished and all their legions on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made and he ceased on the seventh day from all his work which he had made god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because in it he ceased from all his work that he had created to do the garden of eden p this is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created on the day the lord god made earth and heaven no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for the lord god had not caused it to rain on the earth and there was no man to till the ground but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground the lord god formed the man from the dust of the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living creature the lord god planted a garden in eden in the east and there he put the man whom he had formed out of the ground the lord god made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food with the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil a river goes out of eden to water the garden and from there it parts and becomes four heads the name of the first is pishon that is the one which flows through the whole land of havilah where there is gold the gold of that land is good bdellium is there and lapis lazuli the name of the second river is gihon the one that winds through the whole land of cush the name of the third river is hiddekel the one which flows east of assyria and the fourth river is the euphrates the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to work it and to keep it the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may surely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die the lord god said it is not good for the man to be alone i will make him a fitting helper the lord god formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them whatever the man called every living creature that was its name the man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field but for the man there was not found a fitting helper the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place he made the rib which the lord god had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she will be called woman ishah for from man ish was she taken therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will join with his wife and they will become one flesh they were both naked the man and his wife yet they were not ashamed now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts which the lord god had made he said to the woman has god really said you shall not eat of any tree of the garden the woman said to the serpent of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may surely eat but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die the serpent said to the woman you will surely not die for god knows that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise she took of its fruit and ate and she gave some to her husband beside her and he ate the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loinclothes they heard the sound of the lord god walking in the garden in the breeze of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden the lord god called to the man and said to him where are you the man said i heard your sound in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and hid myself god said who told you that you were naked have you eaten of the tree that i commanded you not to eat from the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me of the tree and i ate the lord god said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent deceived me and i ate the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are more cursed that all livestock and above every beast of the field on your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust all the days of your life i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring he will bruise your head and you will bruise his heel s to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth in pain will you bear children your longing will be for your husband and he will rule you s to the man he said because you heeded the voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground because of you in toil you will eat from it all the days of your life it will yield thorns and thistles to you and you will eat the herb of the field by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground for from it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return the man called his wife eve because she was the mother of all that lives the lord god made coats of skins for adam and for his wife and clothed them p the lord god said see the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil now what if he should reach out his hand and take as well of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him out of the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed the cherubs at the east of the garden of eden and the flame of the revolving sword to guard the way to the tree of life cain and abel s now the man had known eve his wife she conceived and gave birth to cain saying i have gotten a man with the lords help again she gave birth to cains brother abel abel became a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground after some years it happened that cain brought an offering to the lord from the fruit of the ground abel too brought from the choice firstlings of his flock and of its fat the lord accepted abel and his offering but cain and his offering he did not accept cain was very angry and his face fell the lord said to cain why are you angry and why has your face fallen surely if you do well there will be lifting up but if you do not do well sin crouches at the door its longing is for you yet you can master it cain said to abel his brother and when they were in the field cain rose up against abel his brother and killed him the lord said to cain where is abel your brother he said i do not know am i my brothers keeper the lord said what have you done the voice of your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground now you are cursed through the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand when you till the ground it will not yield its strength to you you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth cain said to the lord my punishment is too great to bear for you have driven me out this day from upon the surface of the ground and i must hide from your face i will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth and whoever finds me will kill me the lord said to him therefore whoever slays cain vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold the lord put a mark on cain lest any finding him should strike him cain left the lords presence and dwelt in the land of nod east of eden cain knew his wife and she conceived and gave birth to enoch he became the builder of a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch to enoch was born irad and irad begot mehujael and mehujael begot methushael and methushael begot lamech lamech took himself two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other was zillah adah bore jabal

instrument of brass and iron tubal cains sister was naamah lamech said to his wives adah and zillah hear my voice you wives of lamech give ear to my speech for i have slain a man for wounding me a young man for bruising me if cain will be avenged seven times then lamech seventy and seven times adam knew his wife again and she bore a son and called him seth for god has given me other seed instead of abel for cain killed him there was also born a son to seth and he named him enosh it was then that men began to call on the name of the lord from adam to noah s this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man he made him in gods likeness he created them male and female and blessed them and called their name adam on the day they were created adam lived one

too is flesh his days will be one hundred and twenty years the nephilim were in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god took the daughters of men they bore them children those were the mighty men who were of old men of renown p the lord saw that the evil of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually the lord regretted that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him in his heart the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the surface of the ground from man to cattle to creeping things to the birds of the heavens for i regret that i made them but noah found favor in the eyes of the lord parashat noah this is the history of the generations of noah noah was a righteous man blameless among the people of his time noah walked with god noah became the father of three sons shem ham and japheth the earth was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence god saw the earth

an altar to the lord and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar the lord smelled the pleasant aroma the lord said in his heart i will not again

and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease god blessed noah and his sons and said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth the fear of you

that lives will be food for you as the green herb i have given everything to you but flesh with its life its blood you shall not eat i will surely require your blood of your lives at the hand of every animal i will require it at the hand of man even at the hand of every mans brother i will require the life of man whoever sheds mans blood his blood will be shed by man for god made man in his own image be fruitful and multiply increase abundantly in the earth and multiply in it god spoke to noah and to his sons with him saying as for me behold i establish my covenant with you and with your

their families after their languages in their lands after their nations these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood the whole earth was of one language and of one speech it happened as they traveled east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they lived there they said one to another come lets make bricks and burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone and they used tar for mortar they said come lets build ourselves a city and a tower whose top reaches to the sky and lets make ourselves a name lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built the lord said behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is what they begin to do now nothing will be withheld from them which they intend to do come lets go down and there confuse their language that they may not understand one anothers speech so the lord scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth they stopped building the city therefore its name was called babel because there the

also who went with abram had flocks and herds and tents the land was not able to bear them that they might live together for their substance was great so that they could not live together there was a strife between the herdsmen of abrams livestock and the herdsmen of lots livestock and the canaanite and the perizzite lived in the land at that time abram said to lot please let there be no strife between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen for we are relatives isnt the whole land before you please separate yourself from me if you go to the left hand then i will go to the right or if you go to the right hand then i will go to the left lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah

in the land of canaan and lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as sodom now the men of sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against the lord the lord said to abram after

king of sodom i have lifted up my hand to the lord god most high possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours lest you should say i have made abram rich i will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying dont be afraid abram i am your shield your exceedingly great reward abram said lord the lord what will you give me since i go childless and he who will inherit my estate is eliezer of damascus abram said behold to me you have given no seed and behold one born in my house is my heir behold the word of the lord came to him saying this man will not be your heir but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir the lord brought him outside and said look now toward the sky and count the stars if you are able to count them he said to abram so shall your seed be he believed in the lord and he reckoned it to him for righteousness he said to him i am the lord who brought you out of ur of the chaldees to give you this land to inherit it he said lord god how will i know that i will inherit it he said to him bring me a heifer three years old a female goat three years old a ram three years old a turtledove and a young pigeon he brought him all of these and divided them in the middle and laid each half opposite the other but he didnt divide the birds the birds of prey came down on the carcasses and abram drove them away when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell on abram now terror and great darkness fell on him he said to abram know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs and will serve them they will afflict them four hundred years i will also judge that nation whom they will serve afterward they will come out with great wealth but you will go to your fathers in peace you will be buried in a good old age in the fourth generation they will come here again for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces in that day the lord made a covenant with abram saying to your seed i have given this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphrates the kenites the kenizzites the kadmonites the hittites the perizzites the rephaim the amorites the canaanites the girgashites and the jebusites now sarai abrams wife bore him no children she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar sarai said to abram see now the lord has restrained me from bearing please go in to my handmaid it may be that i will obtain children by her abram listened to the voice of sarai sarai abrams wife took hagar the egyptian her handmaid after abram had lived ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to abram her husband to be his wife he went in to hagar and she conceived when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes sarai said to abram this wrong is your fault i gave my handmaid into your bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and you but abram said to sarai behold your maid is in your hand do to her whatever is good in your eyes sarai dealt harshly with her and she fled from her face the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur he said hagar sarais handmaid where did you come from where are you going she said i am fleeing from the face of my mistress sarai the angel of the lord said to her return to your mistress and submit yourself under her hands the angel of the lord said to her i will greatly multiply your seed that they will not be numbered for multitude the angel of the lord said to her behold you are with child and will bear a son you shall call his name ishmael because the lord has heard your affliction he will be like a wild donkey among men his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him he will live opposite all of his brothers she called the name of the lord who spoke to her you are a god who sees for she said have i even stayed alive after seeing him therefore the well was called beer lahai roi behold it is between kadesh and bered hagar bore a son for abram abram called the name of his son whom hagar bore ishmael abram was eighty six years old when hagar bore ishmael to abram when abram was ninety nine years old the lord appeared to abram and said to him i am god almighty walk before me and be blameless i will make my covenant between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly abram fell on his face god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with you you will be the father of a multitude of nations neither will your name any more be called abram but your name will be abraham for i have made you the father of a multitude of nations i will make you exceedingly fruitful and i will make nations of you kings will come out of you i will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god to you and to your seed after you i will give to you and to your seed after you the land where you are traveling all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession i will be their god god said to abraham as for you you will keep my covenant you and your seed after you throughout their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and your seed after you every male among you shall be circumcised you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin it will be a token of the covenant between me and you he who is eight days old will be circumcised among you every male throughout your generations he who is born in the house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised my covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant god said to abraham as for sarai your wife you shall not call her name sarai but her name will be sarah i will bless her and moreover i will give you a son by her yes i will bless her and she will be a mother of nations kings of peoples will come from her then abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old will sarah who is ninety years old give birth abraham said to god oh that ishmael might live before you god said no but sarah your wife will bear you a son you shall call his name isaac i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him as for ishmael i have heard you behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly he will become the father of twelve princes and i will make him a great nation but my covenant i establish with isaac whom sarah will bear to you at this set time next year when he finished talking with him god went up from abraham abraham took ishmael his son all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day as god had said to him abraham was ninety nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin in the same day both abraham and ishmael his son were circumcised all the men of his house those born in the house and those bought with money of a foreigner were circumcised with him parashat vayera the lord appeared to him by the oaks of mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day he lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that three men stood opposite him when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the earth and said my lord if now i have found favor in your sight please dont go away from your servant now let a little water be fetched wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree i will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart after that you may go your way now that you have come to your servant they said very well do as you have said abraham hurried into the tent to sarah and said quickly prepare three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes abraham ran to the herd and fetched a tender and good calf and gave it to the servant he hurried to dress it he took butter milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them he stood by them under the tree and they ate they asked him where is sarah your wife he said see in the tent he said i will certainly return to you when the season comes round behold sarah your wife will have a son sarah heard in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old well advanced in age sarah had passed the age of childbearing sarah laughed within herself saying after i have grown old will i have pleasure my lord being old also the lord said to abraham why did sarah laugh saying will i really bear a child yet i am old is anything too hard for the lord at the set time i will return to you when the season comes round and sarah will have a son then sarah denied saying i didnt laugh for she was afraid he said no but you did laugh the men rose up from there and looked toward sodom abraham went with them to see them on their way the lord said will i hide from abraham what i do since abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him for i have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him that they may keep the way of the lord to do righteousness and justice to the end that the lord may bring on abraham that which he has spoken of him the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me if not i will know the men turned from there and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord abraham drew near and said will you consume the righteous with the wicked what if there are fifty righteous within the city will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it be it far from you to do things like that to kill the righteous with the wicked so that the righteous should be like the wicked may that be far from you shouldnt the judge of all the earth do right the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sake abraham answered see now i have taken it on myself to speak to the lord who am but dust and ashes what if there will lack five of the fifty righteous will you destroy all the city for lack of five he said i will not destroy it if i find forty five there he spoke to him yet again and said what if there are forty found there he said i will not do it for the fortys sake he said oh dont let the lord be angry and i will speak what if there are thirty found there he said i will not do it if i find thirty there he said see now i have taken it on myself to speak to the lord what if there are twenty found there he said i will not destroy it for the twentys sake he said oh dont let the lord be angry and i will speak just once more what if ten are found there he said i will not destroy it for the tens sake the lord went his way as soon as he had finished communing with abraham and abraham returned to his place the two angels came to sodom at evening lot sat in the gate of sodom lot saw them and rose up to meet them he bowed himself with his face to the earth and he said see now my lords please turn aside into your servants house stay all night wash your feet and you can rise up early and go on your way they said no but we will stay in the street all night he urged them greatly and they came in with him and entered into his house he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread and they ate but before they lay down the men of the city the men of sodom surrounded the house both young and old all the people from every quarter they called to lot and said to him where are the men who came in to you this night bring them out to us that we may have sex with them lot went out to them to the door and shut the door after him he said please my brothers dont act so wickedly see now i have two virgin daughters please let me bring them out to you and you may do to them what seems good to you only dont do anything to these men because they have come under the shadow of my roof they said stand back then they said this one fellow came in to live as a foreigner and he appoints himself a judge now will we deal worse with you than with them they pressed hard on the man lot and drew near to break the door but the men reached out their hand and brought lot into the house to them and shut the door they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door the men said to lot do you have anybody else here sons in law your sons your daughters and whoever you have in the city bring them out of the place for we will destroy this place because the outcry against them has grown great before the lord that the lord has sent us to destroy it lot went out and spoke to his sons in law who were pledged to marry his daughters and said get up get out of this place for the lord will destroy the city but he seemed to his sons in law to be joking when the morning came then the angels hurried lot saying get up take your wife and your two daughters who are here lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city but he lingered and the men grabbed his hand his wifes hand and his two daughters hands the lord being merciful to him and they took him out and set him outside of the city it came to pass when they had taken them out that he said escape for your life dont look behind you and dont stay anywhere in the plain escape to the mountains lest you be consumed lot said to them oh not so my lord see now your servant has found favor in your sight and you have magnified your loving kindness which you have shown to me in saving my life i cant escape to the mountain lest evil overtake me and i die see now this city is near to flee to and it is a little one oh let me escape there isnt it a little one and my soul will live he said to him behold i have granted your request concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken hurry escape there for i cant do anything until you get there therefore the name of the city was called zoar the sun had risen on the earth when lot came to zoar then the lord rained on sodom and on gomorrah sulfur and fire from the lord out of the sky he overthrew those cities all the plain all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew on the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the lord he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and looked and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace it happened when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived lot went up out of zoar and lived in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he was afraid to live in zoar he lived in a cave with his two daughters the firstborn said to the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth come lets make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve our fathers seed they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father he didnt know when she lay down nor when she arose it came to pass on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger behold i lay last night with my father let us make him drink wine again tonight you go in and lie with him that we may preserve our fathers seed they made their father drink wine that night also the younger went and lay with him he didnt know when she lay down nor when she got up thus both of lots daughters were with child by their father the firstborn bore a son and named him moab he is the father of the moabites to this day the younger also bore a son and called his name ben ammi he is the father of the children of ammon to this day abraham traveled from there toward the land of the south and lived between kadesh and shur he lived as a foreigner in gerar abraham said about sarah his wife she is my sister abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a mans wife now abimelech had not come near her he said lord will you kill even a righteous nation didnt he tell me she is my sister she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have i done this god said to him in the dream yes i know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this and i also withheld you from sinning against me therefore i didnt allow you to touch her now therefore restore the mans wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live if you dont restore her know for sure that you will die you and all who are yours abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ear the men were very scared then abimelech called abraham and said to him what have you done to us how have i sinned against you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done abimelech said to abraham what did you see that you have done this thing abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place they will kill me for my wifes sake besides she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife it happened when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said to her this is your kindness which you shall show to me everywhere that we go say of me he is my brother abimelech took sheep and cattle male servants and female servants and gave them to abraham and restored sarah his wife to him abimelech said behold my land is before you dwell where it pleases you to sarah he said behold i have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver behold it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you in front of all you are vindicated abraham prayed to god god healed abimelech and his wife and his female servants and they bore children for the lord had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did to sarah as he had spoken sarah conceived and bore abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him abraham called his son who was born to him whom sarah bore to him isaac abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old as god had commanded him abraham was one hundred years old when his son isaac was born to him sarah said god has made me laugh everyone who hears will laugh with me she said who would have said to abraham that sarah would nurse children for i have borne him a son in his old age the child grew and was weaned abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian whom she had borne to abraham mocking therefore she said to abraham cast out this handmaid and her son for the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son isaac the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight on account of his son god said to abraham dont let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your handmaid in all that sarah says to you listen to her voice for from isaac will your seed be called i will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid because he is your seed abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it to hagar putting it on her shoulder and gave her the child and sent her away she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba the water in the bottle was spent and she cast the child under one of the shrubs she went and sat down opposite him a good way off about a bow shot away for she said dont let me see the death of the child she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept god heard the voice of the boy the angel of god called to hagar out of the sky and said to her what ails you hagar dont be afraid for god has heard the voice of the boy where he is get up lift up the boy and hold him in your hand for i will make him a great nation god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water she went filled the bottle with water and gave the boy drink god was with the boy and he grew he lived in the wilderness and became as he grew up an archer he lived in the wilderness of paran his mother took a wife for him out of the land of egypt it happened at that time that abimelech and phicol the captain of his army spoke to abraham saying god is with you in all that you do now therefore swear to me here by god that you will not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that i have done to you you shall do to me and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner abraham said i will swear abraham complained to abimelech because of a water well which abimelechs servants had violently taken away abimelech said i dont know who has done this thing you didnt tell me neither did i hear of it until today abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to abimelech those two made a covenant abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves abimelech said to abraham what do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean he said you shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand that it may be a witness to me that i have dug this well therefore he called that place beersheba because they both swore there so they made a covenant at beersheba abimelech rose up with phicol the captain of his army and they returned into the land of the philistines abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the philistines many days it happened after these things that god tested abraham and said to him abraham he said here i am he said now take your son your only son whom you love even isaac and go into the land of moriah offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which i will tell you of abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son he split the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went to the place of which god had told him on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey the boy and i will go yonder we will worship and come back to you abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on isaac his son he took in his hand the fire and the knife they both went together isaac spoke to abraham his father and said my father he said here i am my son he said here is the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering abraham said god will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering my son so they both went together they came to the place which god had told him of abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar on the wood abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to kill his son the angel of the lord called to him out of the sky and said abraham abraham he said here i am he said dont lay your hand on the boy neither do anything to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son abraham called the name of that place the lord will provide as it is said to this day on the lords mountain it will be provided the angel of the lord called to abraham a second time out of the sky and said i have sworn by myself says the lord because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son your only son that i will bless you greatly and i will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore your seed will possess the gate of his enemies in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed because you have obeyed my voice so abraham returned to his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba abraham lived at beersheba it happened after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she also has borne children to your brother nahor uz his firstborn buz his brother kemuel the father of aram chesed hazo pildash jidlaph and bethuel bethuel became the father of rebekah these eight milcah bore to nahor abrahams brother his concubine whose name was reumah also bore tebah gaham tahash and maacah parashat ayyei sarah sarah lived one hundred twenty seven years this was the length of sarahs life sarah died in kiriath arba the same is hebron in the land of canaan abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of heth saying i am a stranger and a foreigner living with you give me a possession of a burying place with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight the children of heth answered abraham saying to him hear us my lord you are a prince of god among us bury your dead in the best of our tombs none of us will withhold from you his tomb bury your dead abraham rose up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth he talked with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he has which is in the end of his field for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying place now ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of heth ephron the hittite answered abraham in the hearing of the children of heth even of all who went in at the gate of his city saying no my lord hear me i give you the field and i give you the cave that is in it in the presence of the children of my people i give it to you bury your dead abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land he spoke to ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if you will please hear me i will give the price of the field take it from me and i will bury my dead there ephron answered abraham saying to him my lord listen to me what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you therefore bury your dead abraham listened to ephron abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of heth four hundred shekels of silver according to the current merchants standard so the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field that were in all of its borders were deeded to abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all who went in at the gate of his city after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre that is hebron in the land of canaan the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of heth abraham was old and well stricken in age the lord had blessed abraham in all things abraham said to his servant the elder of his house who ruled over all that he had please put your hand under my thigh i will make you swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i live but you shall go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son isaac the servant said to him what if the woman isnt willing to follow me to this land must i bring your son again to the land you came from abraham said to him beware that you dont bring my son there again the lord the god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth who spoke to me and who swore to me saying i will give this land to your seed he will send his angel before you and you shall take a wife for my son from there if the woman isnt willing to follow you then you shall be clear from this my oath only you shall not bring my son there again the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter the servant took ten camels of his masters camels and departed having a variety of good things of his masters with him he arose and went to mesopotamia to the city of nahor he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time that women go out to draw water he said the lord the god of my master abraham please give me success this day and show kindness to my master abraham behold i am standing by the spring of water the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water let it happen that the young lady to whom i will say please let down your pitcher that i may drink and she will say drink and i will also give your camels a drink let her be the one you have appointed for your servant isaac by this i will know that you have shown kindness to my master it happened before he had finished speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel the son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher on her shoulder the young lady was very beautiful to look at a virgin neither had any man known her she went down to the spring filled her pitcher and came up the servant ran to meet her and said please give me a drink a little water from your pitcher she said drink my lord she hurried and let down her pitcher on her hand and gave him drink when she had done giving him drink she said i will also draw for your camels until they have done drinking she hurried and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again to the well to draw and drew for all his camels the man looked steadfastly at her remaining silent to know whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not it happened as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter are you please tell me is there room in your fathers house for us to lodge in she said to him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bore to nahor she said moreover to him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in the man bowed his head and worshiped the lord he said blessed be the lord the god of my master abraham who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master as for me the lord has led me in the way to the house of my masters relatives the young lady ran and told her mothers house about these words rebekah had a brother and his name was laban laban ran out to the man to the spring it happened when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying this is what the man said to me that he came to the man behold he was standing by the camels at the spring he said come in you blessed of the lord why do you stand outside for i have prepared the house and room for the camels the man came into the house and he unloaded the camels he gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him

with her ladies they rode on the camels and followed the man the servant took rebekah and went his way isaac came from the way of beer lahai roi for he lived in the land of the south isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she dismounted from the camel she said to the servant who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us the servant said it is my master she took her veil and covered herself the servant told isaac all the things that he had done isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife he loved her isaac was comforted after his mothers death abraham took another wife and her name was keturah she bore

purchased of the children of heth abraham was buried there with sarah his wife it happened after the death of abraham that god blessed isaac his son isaac lived by beer lahai roi now this is the history of the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bore to abraham these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to the order of their birth the firstborn of ishmael nebaioth then kedar adbeel mibsam mishma dumah massa hadad tema jetur naphish and kedemah these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their villages and

they lived from havilah to shur that is before egypt as you go toward assyria he lived opposite all his relatives parashat toledot this is the history of the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham became the father of isaac isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the syrian of paddan aram the sister of laban the syrian to be his wife isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren the lord was entreated by him and rebekah his wife conceived the children struggled together within her she said if it be so why do i live she went to inquire of the lord the lord said to her two nations are in your womb two peoples will be separated from your body the one people will be stronger than the other people the elder will serve the younger when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb the first came out red all over like a hairy garment they named him esau after that his brother came out and his hand had hold on esaus heel he was named jacob isaac was sixty years old when she bore them the boys grew esau was a skillful hunter a man of the field jacob was a quiet man living in tents now isaac loved esau because he ate his venison rebekah loved jacob jacob boiled stew esau came in from the field and he was famished esau said to jacob please feed me with that same red stew for i am famished therefore his name was called edom jacob said first sell me your birthright esau said behold i am about to die what good is the birthright to me jacob said swear to me first he swore to him he sold his birthright to jacob jacob gave esau bread and stew of lentils he ate and drank rose up and went his way so esau despised his birthright there was a famine in the land besides the first famine that was in the days of abraham isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines to gerar the lord appeared to him and said dont go down into egypt live in the land i will tell you about live in this land and i will be with you and will bless you for to you and to your seed i will give all these lands and i will establish the oath which i swore to abraham your father i will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky and will give to your seed all these lands in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed because abraham obeyed my voice and kept my requirements my commandments my statutes and my laws isaac lived in gerar the men of the place asked him about his wife he said she is my sister for he was afraid to say my wife lest he thought the men of the place might kill me for rebekah because she is beautiful to look at it happened when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was caressing rebekah his wife abimelech called isaac and said behold surely she is your wife why did you say she is my sister isaac said to him because i said lest i die because of her abimelech said what is this you have done to us one of the people might easily have lain with your wife and you would have brought guilt on us abimelech commanded all the people saying he who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted the lord blessed him the man grew great and grew more and more until he became very great he had possessions of flocks possessions of herds and a great household the philistines envied him now all the wells which his fathers servants had dug in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped and filled with earth abimelech said to isaac go from us for you are much mightier than we isaac departed from there encamped in the valley of gerar and lived there isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham he called their names after the names by which his father had called them isaacs servants dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water the herdsmen of gerar argued with isaacs herdsmen saying the water is ours he called the name of the well esek because they contended with him they dug another well and they argued over that also he called its name sitnah he left that place and dug another well they didnt argue over that one he called it rehoboth he said for now the lord has made room for us and we will be fruitful in the land he went up from there to beersheba the lord appeared to him the same night and said i am the god of abraham your father dont be afraid for i am with you and will bless you and multiply your seed for my servant abrahams sake he built an altar there and called on the name of the lord and pitched his tent there there isaacs servants dug a well then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his army isaac said to them why have you come to me since you hate me and have sent me away from you they said we saw plainly that the lord was with you we said let there now be an oath between us even between us and you and let us make a covenant with you that you will do us no harm as we have not touched you and as we have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace you are now the blessed of the lord he made them a feast and they ate and drank they rose up some time in the morning and swore one to another isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace it happened the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug and said to him we have found water he called it shibah therefore the name of the city is beersheba to this day when esau was forty years old he took as wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite they grieved isaacs and rebekahs spirits it happened that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his elder son and said to him my son he said to him here i am he said see now i am old i dont know the day of my death now therefore please take your weapons your quiver and your bow and go out to the field and take me venison make me savory food such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat and that my soul may bless you before i die rebekah heard when isaac spoke to esau his son esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it rebekah spoke to jacob her son saying behold i heard your father speak to esau your brother saying bring me venison and make me savory food that i may eat and bless you before the lord before my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command you go now to the flock and get me from there two good young goats i will make them savory food for your father such as he loves you shall bring it to your father that he may eat so that he may bless you before his death jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man what if my father touches me i will seem to him as a deceiver and i would bring a curse on myself and not a blessing his mother said to him let your curse be on me my son only obey my voice and go get them for me he went and got them and brought them to his mother his mother made savory food such as his father loved rebekah took the good clothes of esau her elder son which were with her in the house and put them on jacob her younger son she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth of his neck she gave the savory food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob he came to his father and said my father he said here i am who are you my son jacob said to his father i am esau your firstborn i have done what you asked me to do please arise sit and eat of my venison that your soul may bless me isaac said to his son how is it that you have found it so quickly my son he said because the lord your god gave me success isaac said to jacob please come near that i may feel you my son whether you are really my son esau or not jacob went near to isaac his father he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau he didnt recognize him because his hands were hairy like his brother esaus hands so he blessed him he said are you really my son esau he said i am he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless you he brought it near to him and he ate he brought him wine and he drank his father isaac said to him come near now and kiss me my son he came near and kissed him he smelled the smell of his clothing and blessed him and said behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord has blessed god give you of the dew of the sky of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and new wine let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you be lord over your brothers let your mothers sons bow down to you cursed be everyone who curses you blessed be everyone who blesses you it happened as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob had just gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting he also made savory food and brought it to his father he said to his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that your soul may bless me isaac his father said to him who are you he said i am your son your firstborn esau isaac trembled violently and said who then is he who has taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before you came and have blessed him yes he will be blessed when esau heard the words of his father he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry and said to his father bless me even me also my father he said your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing he said isnt he rightly named jacob for he has supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright see now he has taken away my blessing he said havent you reserved a blessing for me isaac answered esau behold i have made him your lord and all his brothers have i given to him for servants with grain and new wine have i sustained him what then will i do for you my son esau said to his father have you but one blessing my father bless me even me also my father esau lifted up his voice and wept isaac his father answered him behold of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling and of the dew of the sky from above by your sword will you live and you will serve your brother it will happen when you will break loose that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck esau hated jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then i will kill my brother jacob the words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah she sent and called jacob her younger son and said to him behold your brother esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee to laban my brother in haran stay with him a few days until your brothers fury turns away until your brothers anger turn away from you and he forgets what you have done to him then i will send and get you from there why should i be bereaved of you both in one day rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob takes a wife of the daughters of heth such as these of the daughters of the land what good will my life do me isaac called jacob blessed him and commanded him you shall not take a wife of the daughters of canaan arise go to paddan aram to the house of bethuel your mothers father take a wife from there from the daughters of laban your mothers brother may god almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you that you may be a company of peoples and give you the blessing of abraham to you and to your seed with you that you may inherit the land where you travel which god gave to abraham isaac sent jacob away he went to paddan aram to laban son of bethuel the syrian rebekahs brother jacobs and esaus mother now esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to paddan aram to take him a wife from there and that as he blessed him he gave him a command saying you shall not take a wife of the daughters of canaan and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to paddan aram esau saw that the daughters of canaan didnt please isaac his father esau went to ishmael and took besides the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebaioth to be his wife parashat vaye ei jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran he came to a certain place and stayed there all night because the sun had set he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep he dreamed behold a stairway set upon the earth and its top reached to heaven behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac the land whereon you lie to you will i give it and to your seed your seed will be as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed behold i am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again into this land for i will not leave you until i have done that which i have spoken of to you jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i didnt know it he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other than gods house and this is the gate of heaven jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on its top he called the name of that place bethel but the name of the city was luz at the first jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on so that i come again to my fathers house in peace and the lord will be my god then this stone which i have set up for a pillar will be gods house of all that you will give me i will surely give the tenth to you then jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east he looked and behold a well in the field and behold three flocks of sheep lying there by it for out of that well they watered the flocks the stone on the wells mouth was large there all the flocks were gathered they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again on the wells mouth in its place jacob said to them my relatives where are you from they said we are from haran he said to them do you know laban the son of nahor they said we know him he said to them is it well with him they said it is well see rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep he said behold it is still the middle of the day not time to gather the livestock together water the sheep and go and feed them they said we cant until all the flocks are gathered together and they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept them it happened when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son she ran and told her father it happened when laban heard the news of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet jacob and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house jacob told laban all these things laban said to him surely you are my bone and my flesh he lived with him for a month laban said to jacob because you are my brother should you therefore serve me for nothing tell me what will your wages be laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel leahs eyes were weak but rachel was beautiful in form and attractive jacob loved rachel he said i will serve you seven years for rachel your younger daughter laban said it is better that i give her to you than that i should give her to another man stay with me jacob served seven years for rachel they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had for her jacob said to laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in to her laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast it happened in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him he went in to her laban gave zilpah his handmaid to his daughter leah for a handmaid it happened in the morning that behold it was leah he said to laban what is this you have done to me didnt i serve with you for rachel why then have you deceived me laban said it is not done so in our place to give the younger before the firstborn fulfill the week of this one and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years jacob did so and fulfilled her week he gave him rachel his daughter as wife laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid he went in also to rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years the lord saw that leah was hated and he opened her womb but rachel was barren leah conceived and bore a son and she named him reuben for she said because the lord has looked at my affliction for now my husband will love me she conceived again and bore a son and said because the lord has heard that i am hated he has therefore given me this son also she named him simeon she conceived again and bore a son said now this time will my husband be joined to me because i have borne him three sons therefore his name was called levi she conceived again and bore a son she said this time will i praise the lord therefore she named him judah then she stopped bearing when rachel saw that she bore jacob no children rachel envied her sister she said to jacob give me children or else i will die jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods place who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb she said behold my maid bilhah go in to her that she may bear on my knees and i also may obtain children by her she gave him bilhah her handmaid as wife and jacob went in to her bilhah conceived and bore jacob a son rachel said god has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son therefore called she his name dan bilhah rachels handmaid conceived again and bore jacob a second son rachel said with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and have prevailed she named him naphtali when leah saw that she had finished bearing she took zilpah her handmaid and gave her to jacob as a wife zilpah leahs handmaid bore jacob a son leah said how fortunate she named him gad zilpah leahs handmaid bore jacob a second son leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me happy she named him asher reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother leah then rachel said to leah please give me some of your sons mandrakes she said to her is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband would you take away my sons mandrakes also rachel said therefore he will lie with you tonight for your sons mandrakes jacob came from the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said you must come in to me for i have surely hired you with my sons mandrakes he lay with her that night god listened to leah and she conceived and bore jacob a fifth son leah said god has given me my hire because i gave my handmaid to my husband she named him issachar leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to jacob leah said god has endowed me with a good dowry now my husband will live with me because i have borne him six sons she named him zebulun afterwards she bore a daughter and named her dinah god remembered rachel and god listened to her and opened her womb she conceived bore a son and said god has taken away my reproach she named him joseph saying may the lord add another son to me it happened when rachel had borne joseph that jacob said to laban send me away that i may go to my own place and to my country give me my wives and my children for whom i have served you and let me go for you know my service with which i have served you laban said to him if now i have found favor in your eyes stay here for i have divined that the lord has blessed me for your sake he said appoint me your wages and i will give it he said to him you know how i have served you and how your livestock have fared with me for it was little which you had before i came and it has increased to a multitude the lord has blessed you wherever i turned now when will i provide for my own house also he said what shall i give you jacob said you shall not give me anything if you will do this thing for me i will again feed your flock and keep it i will pass through all your flock today removing from there every speckled and spotted one and every black one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats this will be my hire so my righteousness will answer for me hereafter when you come concerning my hire that is before you every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep that might be with me will be counted stolen laban said behold let it be according to your word that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white in it and all the black ones among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons he set three days journey between himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar almond plane tree peeled white streaks in them and made the white appear which was in the rods he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink they conceived when they came to drink the flocks conceived before the rods and the flocks produced streaked speckled and spotted jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of laban and he put his own droves apart and didnt put them into labans flock it happened whenever the stronger of the flock conceived that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods but when the flock were feeble he didnt put them in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks female servants and male servants and camels and donkeys he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob has taken away all that was our fathers from that which was our fathers has he gotten all this wealth jacob saw the expression on labans face and behold it was not toward him as before the lord said to jacob return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and i will be with you jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field to his flock and said to them i see the expression on your fathers face that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father has been with me you know that i have served your father with all of my strength your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god didnt allow him to hurt me if he said this the speckled will be your wages then all the flock bore speckled if he said this the streaked will be your wages then all the flock bore streaked thus god has taken away your fathers livestock and given them to me it happened during mating season that i lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream and behold the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked speckled and grizzled the angel of god said to me in the dream jacob and i said here i am he said now lift up your eyes and behold all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban does to you i am the god of bethel where you anointed a pillar where you vowed a vow to me now arise get out from this land and return to the land of your birth rachel and leah answered him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house arent we accounted by him as foreigners for he has sold us and has also quite devoured our money for all the riches which god has taken away from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatever god has said to you do then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives on the camels and he took away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gathered including the livestock which he had gained in paddan aram to go to isaac his father to the land of canaan now laban had gone to shear his sheep and rachel stole the teraphim that were her fathers jacob deceived laban the syrian in that he didnt tell him that he was running away so he fled with all that he had he rose up passed over the river and set his face toward the mountain of gilead laban was told on the third day that jacob had fled he took his relatives with him and pursued after him seven days journey he overtook him in the mountain of gilead god came to laban the syrian in a dream of the night and said to him take heed to yourself that you dont speak to jacob either good or bad laban caught up with jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of gilead laban said to jacob what have you done that you have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword why did you flee secretly and deceive me and didnt tell me that i might have sent you away with mirth and with songs with tambourine and with harp and didnt allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters now have you done foolishly it is in the power of my hand to hurt you but the god of your father spoke to me last night saying take heed to yourself that you dont speak to jacob either good or bad now you want to be gone because you greatly longed for your fathers house but why have you stolen my gods jacob answered laban because i was afraid for i said lest you should take your daughters from me by force anyone you find your gods with shall not live before our relatives discern what is yours with me and take it for jacob didnt know that rachel had stolen them laban went into jacobs tent into leahs tent and into the tent of the two female servants but he didnt find them he went out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent now rachel had taken the teraphim put them in the camels saddle and sat on them laban felt about all the tent but didnt find them she said to her father dont let my lord be angry that i cant rise up before you for im having my period he searched but didnt find the teraphim jacob was angry and argued with laban jacob answered laban what is my trespass what is my sin that you have hotly pursued after me now that you have felt around in all my stuff what have you found of all your household stuff set it here before my relatives and your relatives that they may judge between us two these twenty years i have been with you your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young and i havent eaten the rams of your flocks that which was torn of animals i didnt bring to you i bore its loss of my hand you required it whether stolen by day or stolen by night this was my situation in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep fled from my eyes these twenty years i have been in your house i served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock and you have changed my wages ten times unless the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely now you would have sent me away empty god has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night laban answered jacob the daughters are my daughters the children are my children the flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine and what can i do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne now come let us make a covenant you and i and let it be for a witness between me and you jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar jacob said to his relatives gather stones they took stones and made a heap they ate there by the heap laban called it jegar sahadutha but jacob called it galeed laban said this heap is witness between me and you this day therefore it was named galeed and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and you when we are absent one from another if you afflict my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters no man is with us behold god is witness between me and you laban said to jacob see this heap and see the pillar which i have set between me and you may this heap be a witness and the pillar be a witness that i will not pass over this heap to you and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me for harm the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge between us then jacob swore by the fear of his father isaac jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and called his relatives to eat bread they ate bread and stayed all night in the mountain early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them laban departed and returned to his place jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him when he saw them jacob said this is gods army he called the name of that place mahanaim parashat vayishla jacob sent messengers in front of him to esau his brother to the land of seir the field of edom he commanded them saying this is what you shall tell my lord esau this is what your servant jacob says i have lived as a foreigner with laban and stayed until now i have cattle donkeys flocks male servants and female servants i have sent to tell my lord that i may find favor in your sight the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to your brother esau not only that but he comes to meet you and four hundred men with him then jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two companies and he said if esau comes to the one company and strikes it then the company which is left will escape jacob said god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord who said to me return to your country and to your relatives and i will do you good i am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses and of all the truth which you have shown to your servant for with just my staff i passed over this jordan and now i have become two companies please deliver me from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children you said i will surely do you good and make your seed as the sand of the sea which cant be numbered because there are so many he lodged there that night and took from that which he had with him a present for esau his brother two hundred female goats and twenty male goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milk camels and their colts forty cows ten bulls twenty female donkeys and ten foals he delivered them into the hands of his servants every herd by itself and said to his servants pass over before me and put a space between herd and herd he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meets you and asks you saying whose are you where are you going whose are these before you then you shall say they are your servant jacobs it is a present sent to my lord esau behold he also is behind us he commanded also the second and the third and all that followed the herds saying this is how you shall speak to esau when you find him you shall say not only that but behold your servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goes before me and afterward i will see his face perhaps he will accept me so the present passed over before him and he himself lodged that night in the camp he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two handmaids and his eleven sons and passed over the ford of the jabbok he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over that which he had jacob was left alone and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day when he saw that he didnt prevail against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was strained as he wrestled the man said let me go for the day breaks jacob said i wont let you go unless you bless me he said to him what is your name he said jacob he said your name will no longer be called jacob but israel for you have fought with god and with men and have prevailed jacob asked him please tell me your name he said why is it that you ask what my name is he blessed him there jacob called the name of the place peniel for he said i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved the sun rose on him as he passed over peniel and he limped because of his thigh therefore the children of israel dont eat the sinew of the hip which is on the hollow of the thigh to this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew of the hip jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau was coming and with him four hundred men he divided the children between leah rachel and the two handmaids he put the handmaids and their children in front leah and her children after and rachel and joseph at the rear he himself passed over in front of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother esau ran to meet him embraced him fell on his neck kissed him and they wept he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are these with you he said the children whom god has graciously given your servant then the handmaids came near with their children and they bowed themselves leah also and her children came near and bowed themselves after them joseph came near with rachel and they bowed themselves esau said what do you mean by all this company which i met jacob said to find favor in the sight of my lord esau said i have enough my brother let that which you have be yours jacob said please no if i have now found favor in your sight then receive my present at my hand because i have seen your face as one sees the face of god and you were pleased with me please take the gift that i brought to you because god has dealt graciously with me and because i have enough he urged him and he took it esau said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before you jacob said to him my lord knows that the children are tender and that the flocks and herds with me have their young and if they overdrive them one day all the flocks will die please let my lord pass over before his servant and i will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children until i come to my lord to seir esau said let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me he said why let me find favor in the sight of my lord so esau returned that day on his way to seir jacob traveled to succoth built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock therefore the name of the place is called succoth jacob came in peace to the city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from paddan aram and encamped before the city he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for one hundred pieces of money he erected an altar there and called it el elohe israel dinah the daughter of leah whom she bore to jacob went out to see the daughters of the land shechem the son of hamor the hivite the prince of the land saw her he took her lay with her and humbled her his soul joined to dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the young lady and spoke kindly to the young lady shechem spoke to his father hamor saying get me this young lady as a wife now jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter and his sons were with his livestock in the field jacob held his peace until they came hamor the father of shechem went out to jacob to talk with him the sons of jacob came in from the field when they heard it the men were grieved and they were very angry because he had done folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter a which thing ought not to be done hamor talked with them saying the soul of my son shechem longs for your daughter please give her to him as a wife make marriages with us give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves you shall dwell with us and the land will be before you live and trade in it and get possessions in it shechem said to her father and to her brothers let me find favor in your eyes and whatever you will tell me i will give ask me a great amount for a dowry and i will give whatever you ask of me but give me the young lady as a wife the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with deceit and spoke because he had defiled dinah their sister and said to them we cant do this thing to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised for that is a reproach to us only on this condition will we consent to you if you will be as we are that every male of you be circumcised then will we give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people but if you will not listen to us to be circumcised then we will take our sister and we will be gone their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son the young man didnt wait to do this thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was honored above all the house of his father hamor and shechem his son came to the gate of their city and talked with the men of their city saying these men are peaceful with us therefore let them live in the land and trade in it for behold the land is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us to become one people if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised wont their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours only let us give our consent to them and they will dwell with us all who went out of the gate of his city listened to hamor and to shechem his son and every male was circumcised all who went out of the gate of his city it happened on the third day when they were sore that two of jacobs sons simeon and levi dinahs brothers each took his sword came upon the unsuspecting city and killed all the males they killed hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went away jacobs sons came on the dead and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister they took their flocks their herds their donkeys that which was in the city that which was in the field and all their wealth they took captive all their little ones and their wives and took as plunder everything that was in the house jacob said to simeon and levi you have troubled me to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites i am few in number they will gather themselves together against me and strike me and i will be destroyed i and my house they said should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute god said to jacob arise go up to bethel and live there make there an altar to god who appeared to you when you fled from the face of esau your brother then jacob said to his household and to all who were with him put away the foreign gods that are among you purify yourselves change your garments let us arise and go up to bethel i will make there an altar to god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went they gave to jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands and the rings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem they traveled and a terror of god was on the cities that were around them and they didnt pursue the sons of jacob so jacob came to luz that is bethel which is in the land of canaan he and all the people who were with him he built an altar there and called the place el beth el because there god was revealed to him when he fled from the face of his brother deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried below bethel under the oak and its name was called allon bacuth god appeared to jacob again when he came from paddan aram and blessed him god said to him your name is jacob your name shall not be jacob any more but your name will be israel he named him israel god said to him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations will be from you and kings will come out of your body the land which i gave to abraham and isaac i will give it to you and to your seed after you will i give the land god went up from him in the place where he spoke with him jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him a pillar of stone he poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it jacob called the name of the place where god spoke with him bethel they traveled from bethel there was still some distance to come to ephrath and rachel travailed she had hard labor when she was in hard labor the midwife said to her dont be afraid for now you will have another son it happened as her soul was departing for she died that she named him benoni but his father named him benjamin rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem jacob set up a pillar on her grave the same is the pillar of rachels grave to this day israel traveled and spread his tent beyond the tower of eder it happened while israel lived in that

with his brothers he was a boy with the sons of bilhah and zilpah his fathers wives joseph brought an evil report of them to their father now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers and they hated him and couldnt speak peaceably to him joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him all the more he said to them please hear this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and behold my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf his brothers said to him will you indeed reign over us or will you indeed have dominion over us they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers and said behold i have dreamed yet another dream and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me he told it to his father and to his brothers his father rebuked him and said to him what is this dream that you have dreamed will i and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth his brothers envied him but his father kept this saying in mind his brothers went to feed their fathers flock in shechem israel said to joseph arent your brothers feeding the flock in shechem come and i will send you to them he said to him here i am he said to him go now see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flock and bring me word again so he sent him out of the valley of hebron and he came to shechem a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field the man asked him what are you looking for he said i am looking for my brothers tell me please where they are feeding the flock the man said they have left here for i heard them say let us go to dothan joseph went after his brothers and found them in dothan they saw him afar off and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him they said one to another behold this dreamer comes come now therefore and lets kill him and cast him into one of the pits and we will say an evil animal has devoured him we will see what will become of his dreams reuben heard it and delivered him out of their hand and said lets not take his life reuben said to them shed no blood throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness but lay no hand on him that he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father it happened when joseph came to his brothers that they stripped joseph of his coat the coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and threw him into the pit the pit was empty there was no water in it they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and saw a caravan of ishmaelites was coming from gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt judah said to his brothers what profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood come and lets sell him to the ishmaelites and not let our hand be on him for he is our brother our flesh his brothers listened to him midianites who were merchants passed by and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver they brought joseph into egypt reuben returned to the pit and saw that joseph wasnt in the pit and he tore his clothes he returned to his brothers and said the child is no more and i where will i go they took josephs coat and killed a male goat and dipped the coat in the blood they took the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said we have found this examine it now whether it is your sons coat or not he recognized it and said it is my sons coat an evil animal has devoured him joseph is without doubt torn in pieces jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his waist and mourned for his son many days all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted he said for i will go down to sheol to my son mourning his father wept for him the midianites sold him into egypt to potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard it happened at that time that judah went down from his brothers and visited a certain adullamite whose name was hirah judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua he took her and went in to her she conceived and bore a son and he named him er she conceived again and bore a son and she named him onan she yet again bore a son and named him shelah and he was at chezib when she bore him judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord the lord killed him judah said to onan go in to your brothers wife and perform the duty of a husbands brother to her and raise up seed to your brother onan knew that the seed wouldnt be his and it happened when he went in to his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest he should give seed to his brother the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the lord and he killed him also then judah said to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow in your fathers house until shelah my son is grown up for he said lest he also die like his brothers tamar went and lived in her fathers house after many days shuas daughter the wife of judah died judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers to timnah he and his friend hirah the adullamite it was told tamar saying behold your father in law is going up to timnah to shear his sheep she took off of her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of enaim which is by the way to timnah for she saw that shelah was grown up and she wasnt given to him as a wife when judah saw her he thought that she was a prostitute for she had covered her face he turned to her by the way and said please come let me come in to you for he didnt know that she was his daughter in law she said what will you give me that you may come in to me he said i will send you a young goat from the flock she said will you give me a pledge until you send it he said what pledge will i give you she said your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand he gave them to her and came in to her and she conceived by him she arose and went away and put off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive the pledge from the womans hand but he didnt find her then he asked the men of her place saying where is the prostitute that was at enaim by the road they said there has been no prostitute here he returned to judah and said i havent found her and also the men of the place said there has been no prostitute here judah said let her keep it lest we be shamed behold i sent this young goat and you havent found her it happened about three months later that it was told judah saying tamar your daughter in law has played the prostitute and moreover behold she is with child by prostitution judah said bring her out and let her be burnt when she was brought out she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are i am with child she also said please discern whose are these the signet and the cords and the staff judah acknowledged them and said she is more righteous than i because i didnt give her to shelah my son he knew her again no more it happened in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb when she travailed one put out a hand and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand saying this came out first it happened as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said why have you made a breach for yourself therefore his name was called perez afterward his brother came out that had the scarlet thread on his hand and his name was called zerah joseph was brought down to egypt potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard an egyptian bought him from the hand of the ishmaelites that had brought him down there the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man he was in the house of his master the egyptian his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did prosper in his hand joseph found favor in his sight he ministered to him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand it happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field he left all that he had in josephs hand he didnt concern himself with anything except for the food which he ate joseph was well built and handsome it happened after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes on joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said to his masters wife behold my master doesnt know what is with me in the house and he has put all that he has into my hand he isnt greater in this house than i neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god as she spoke to joseph day by day he didnt listen to her to lie by her or to be with her about this time he went into the house to do his work and there were none of the men of the house inside she caught him by his garment saying lie with me he left his garment in her hand and ran outside when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had run outside she called to the men of her house and spoke to them saying behold he has brought in a hebrew to us to mock us he came in to me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice it happened when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and ran outside she laid up his garment by her until his master came home she spoke to him according to these words saying the hebrew servant whom you have brought to us came in to me to mock me and it happened as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and ran outside it happened when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him saying this is what your servant did to me that his wrath was kindled josephs master took him and put him into the prison the place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in custody but the lord was with joseph and showed kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners who were in the prison whatever they did there he was responsible for it the keeper of the prison didnt look after anything that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it prosper it happened after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound the captain of the guard assigned them to joseph and he took care of them they stayed in prison many days they both dreamed a dream each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the cupbearer and the baker of the king of egypt who were bound in the prison joseph came in to them in the morning and saw them and saw that they were sad he asked pharaohs officers who were with him in custody in his masters house saying why do you look so sad today they said to him we have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it joseph said to them dont interpretations belong to god please tell it to me the chief cupbearer told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was in front of me and in the vine were three branches it was as though it budded it blossomed and its clusters produced ripe grapes pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand joseph said to him this is its interpretation the three branches are three days within three more days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office you will give pharaohs cup into his hand the way you did when you were his cupbearer but remember me when it will be well with you and please show kindness to me and make mention of me to pharaoh and bring me out of this house for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said to joseph i also was in my dream and behold three baskets of white bread were on my head in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for pharaoh and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head joseph answered this is its interpretation the three baskets are three days within three more days pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and will hang you on a tree and the birds will eat your flesh from off you it happened the third day which was pharaohs birthday that he made a feast for all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants he restored the chief cupbearer to his position again and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them yet the chief cupbearer didnt remember joseph but forgot him parashat mikke it happened at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river behold there came up out of the river seven cattle sleek and fat and they fed in the marsh grass behold seven other cattle came up after them out of the river ugly and thin and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river the ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle so pharaoh awoke he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven heads of grain came up on one stalk healthy and good behold seven heads of grain thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all of egypts magicians and wise men pharaoh told them his dreams but there was no one who could interpret them to pharaoh then the chief cupbearer spoke to pharaoh saying i remember my faults today pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard me and the chief baker we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream there was with us there a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he interpreted it happened as he interpreted to us so it was he restored me to my office and he hanged him then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon he shaved himself changed his clothing and came in to pharaoh pharaoh said to joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it i have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it joseph answered pharaoh saying it isnt in me god will give pharaoh an answer of peace pharaoh spoke to joseph in my dream behold i stood on the brink of the river and behold there came up out of the river seven cattle fat and sleek they fed in the marsh grass and behold seven other cattle came up after them poor and very ugly and thin such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for ugliness the thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle and when they had eaten them up it couldnt be known that they had eaten them but they were still ugly as at the beginning so i awoke i saw in my dream and behold seven heads of grain came up on one stalk full and good and behold seven heads of grain withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain i told it to the magicians but there was no one who could explain it to me joseph said to pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one what god is about to do he has declared to pharaoh the seven good cattle are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years the dream is one the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind they will be seven years of famine that is the thing which i spoke to pharaoh what god is about to do he has shown to pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt there will arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of egypt the famine will consume the land and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows for it will be very grievous the dream was doubled to pharaoh because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypts produce in the seven plenteous years let them gather all the food of these good years that come and lay up grain under the hand of pharaoh for food in the cities and let them keep it the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine which will be in the land of egypt that the land not perish through the famine the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants pharaoh said to his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom is the spirit of god pharaoh said to joseph because god has shown you all of this there is none so discreet and wise as you you shall be over my house and according to your word will all my people be ruled only in the throne i will be greater than you pharaoh said to joseph behold i have set you over all the land of egypt pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on josephs hand and arrayed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had they cried before him bow the knee he set him over all the land of egypt pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt pharaoh called josephs name zaphenath paneah and he gave him asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on as a wife joseph went out over the land of egypt joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was around every city he laid up in the same joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea very much until he stopped counting for it was without number to joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bore to him joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for he said god has made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house the name of the second he called ephraim for god has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction the seven years of plenty that were in the land of egypt came to an end the seven years of famine began to come just as joseph had said there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said to all the egyptians go to joseph what he says to you do the famine was over all the surface of the earth joseph opened all the store houses and sold to the egyptians the famine was severe in the land of egypt all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain because the famine was severe in all the earth now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt and jacob said to his sons why do you look at one another he said behold i have heard that there is grain in egypt go down there and buy for us from there so that we may live and not die josephs ten brothers went down to buy grain from egypt but jacob didnt send benjamin josephs brother with his brothers for he said lest perhaps harm happen to him the sons of israel came to buy among those who came for the famine was in the land of canaan joseph was the governor over the land it was he who sold to all the people of the land josephs brothers came and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them but acted like a stranger to them and spoke roughly with them he said to them where did you come from they said from the land of canaan to buy food joseph recognized his brothers but they didnt recognize him joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them and said to them you are spies you have come to see the nakedness of the land they said to him no my lord but your servants have come to buy food we are all one mans sons we are honest men your servants are not spies he said to them no but you have come to see the nakedness of the land they said we your servants are twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is no more joseph said to them it is like i told you saying you are spies by this you shall be tested by the life of pharaoh you shall not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here send one of you and let him get your brother and you shall be bound that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies he put them all together into custody for three days joseph said to them the third day do this and live for i fear god if you are honest men then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison but you go carry grain for the famine of your houses bring your youngest brother to me so will your words be verified and you wont die they did so they said one to another we are certainly guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he begged us and we wouldnt listen therefore this distress has come upon us reuben answered them saying didnt i tell you saying dont sin against the child and you wouldnt listen therefore also behold his blood is required they didnt know that joseph understood them for there was an interpreter between them he turned himself away from them and wept then he returned to them and spoke to them and took simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes then joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain and to restore each mans money into his sack and to give them food for the way so it was done to them they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place he saw his money behold it was in the mouth of his sack he said to his brothers my money is restored behold it is in my sack their hearts failed them and they turned trembling one to another saying what is this that god has done to us they came to jacob their father to the land of canaan and told him all that had happened to them saying the man the lord of the land spoke roughly with us and took us for spies of the country we said to him we are honest men we are no spies we are twelve brothers sons of our father one is no more and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan the man the lord of the land said to us by this i will know that you are honest men leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your houses and go your way bring your youngest brother to me then i will know that you are not spies but that you are honest men so i will deliver your brother to you and you shall trade in the land it happened as they emptied their sacks that behold each mans bundle of money was in his sack when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid jacob their father said to them you have bereaved me of my children joseph is no more simeon is no more and you want to take benjamin away all these things are against me reuben spoke to his father saying kill my two sons if i dont bring him to you entrust him to my care and i will bring him to you again he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he only is left if harm happens to him along the way in which you go then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol the famine was severe in the land it happened when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of egypt their father said to them go again buy us a little more food judah spoke to him saying the man solemnly warned us saying you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you if youll send our brother with us well go down and buy you food but if youll not send him well not go down for the man said to us you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you israel said why did you treat me so badly telling the man that you had another brother they said the man asked directly concerning ourselves and concerning our relatives saying is your father still alive have you another brother we just answered his questions is there any way we could know that he would say bring your brother down judah said to israel his father send the boy with me and well get up and go so that we may live and not die both we and you and also our little ones ill be collateral for him from my hand will you require him if i dont bring him to you and set him before you then let me bear the blame forever for if we hadnt delayed surely we would have returned a second time by now their father israel said to them if it must be so then do this take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags and carry down a present for the man a little balm a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds and take double money in your hand and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks perhaps it was an oversight take your brother also get up and return to the man may god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may release to you your other brother and benjamin if i am bereaved of my children i am bereaved the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and got up went down to egypt and stood before joseph when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house bring the men into the house and butcher an animal and prepare for the men will dine with me at noon the man did as joseph commanded and the man brought the men to josephs house the men were afraid because they were brought to josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time were brought in that he may seek occasion against us attack us and seize us as slaves along with our donkeys they came near to the steward of josephs house and they spoke to him at the door of the house and said oh my lord we indeed came down the first time to buy food when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks and behold each mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight we have brought it back in our hand we have brought down other money in our hand to buy food we dont know who put our money in our sacks he said peace be to you dont be afraid your god and the god of your father has given you treasure in your sacks i received your money he brought simeon out to them the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet he gave their donkeys fodder they prepared the present for josephs coming at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves down to him to the earth he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom you spoke is he yet alive they said your servant our father is well he is still alive they bowed down humbly he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother his mothers son and said is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me he said god be gracious to you my son joseph hurried for his heart yearned over his brother and he sought a place to weep he entered into his room and wept there he washed his face and came out he controlled himself and said serve the meal they served him by himself and them by themselves and the egyptians that ate with him by themselves because the egyptians dont eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination to the egyptians they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marveled one with another he sent portions to them from before him but benjamins portion was five times as much as any of theirs they drank and were merry with him he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put each mans money in his sacks mouth put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest with his grain money he did according to the word that joseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their donkeys when they had gone out of the city and were not yet far off joseph said to his steward up follow after the men when you overtake them ask them why have you rewarded evil for good isnt this that from which my lord drinks and by which he indeed divines you have done evil in so doing he overtook them and he spoke these words to them they said to him why does my lord speak such words as these far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again to you out of the land of canaan how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lords house with whomever of your servants it is found let him die and we also will be my lords bondservants he said now also let it be according to your words he with whom it is found will be my bondservant and you will be blameless then they hurried and each man took his sack down to the ground and each man opened his sack he searched beginning with the eldest and ending at the youngest the cup was found in benjamins sack then they tore their clothes and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city judah and his brothers came to josephs house and he was still there they fell on the ground before him joseph said to them what deed is this that you have done dont you know that such a man as i can indeed divine judah said what will we tell my lord what will we speak or how will we clear ourselves god has found out the iniquity of your servants behold we are my lords bondservants both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found he said far be it from me that i should do so the man in whose hand the cup is found he will be my bondservant but as for you go up in peace to your father parashat vayigash then judah came near to him and said oh my lord please let your servant speak a word in my lords ears and dont let your anger burn against your servant for you are even as pharaoh my lord asked his servants saying have you a father or a brother we said to my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loves him you said to your servants bring him down to me that i may set my eyes on him we said to my lord the boy cant leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die you said to your servants unless your youngest brother comes down with you you will see my face no more it happened when we came up to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord our father said go again buy us a little food we said we cant go down if our youngest brother is with us then we will go down for we may not see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us your servant my father said to us you know that my wife bore me two sons and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i havent seen him since if you take this one also from me and harm happens to him you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol now therefore when i come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us since his life is bound up in the boys life it will happen when he sees that the boy is no more that he will die your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to sheol for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father saying if i dont bring him to you then i will bear the blame to my father forever now therefore please let your servant stay instead of the boy a bondservant to my lord and let the boy go up with his brothers for how will i go up to my father if the boy isnt with me lest i see the evil that will come on my father then joseph couldnt control himself before all those who stood before him and he cried cause everyone to go out from me no one else stood with him while joseph made himself known to his brothers he wept aloud the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard joseph said to his brothers i am joseph does my father still live his brothers couldnt answer him for they were terrified at his presence joseph said to his brothers come near to me please they came near he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt now dont be grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here for god sent me before you to preserve life for these two years the famine has been in the land and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest god sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth and to save you alive by a great deliverance so now it wasnt you who sent me here but god and he has made me a father to pharaoh lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt hurry and go up to my father and tell him this is what your son joseph says god has made me lord of all egypt come down to me dont wait you shall dwell in the land of goshen and you will be near to me you your children your childrens children your flocks your herds and all that you have there i will nourish you for there are yet five years of famine lest you come to poverty you and your household and all that you have behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaks to you you shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that you have seen you shall hurry and bring my father down here he fell on his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept on his neck he kissed all his brothers and wept on them after that his brothers talked with him the report of it was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brothers have come it pleased pharaoh well and his servants pharaoh said to joseph tell your brothers do this load your animals and go travel to the land of canaan take your father and your households and come to me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and you will eat the fat of the land now you are commanded do this take wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come also dont concern yourselves about your belongings for the good of all of the land of egypt is yours the sons of israel did so joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way he gave each one of them changes of clothing but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing he sent the following to his father ten donkeys loaded with the good things of egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way so he sent his brothers away and they departed he said to them see that you dont quarrel on the way they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan to jacob their father they told him saying joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of egypt his heart fainted for he didnt believe them they told him all the words of joseph which he had said to them when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived israel said it is enough joseph my son is still alive i will go and see him before i die israel traveled with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices to the god of his father isaac god spoke to israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob he said here i am he said i am god the god of your father dont be afraid to go down into egypt for there i will make of you a great nation i will go down with you into egypt i will also surely bring you up again joseph will close your eyes jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him they took their livestock and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and he brought all his seed with him into egypt these are the names of the children of israel who came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn the sons of reuben hanoch pallu hezron and carmi the sons of simeon jemuel jamin ohad jachin zohar and shaul the son of a canaanite woman the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari the sons

elon and jahleel these are the sons of leah whom she bore to jacob in paddan aram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty three the sons of gad ziphion haggi shuni ezbon eri arodi and areli the sons of asher imnah ishvah ishvi beriah and serah their sister the sons of beriah heber and malchiel these are the sons of zilpah whom laban gave to leah his daughter and these she bore to jacob even sixteen souls the sons of rachel jacobs wife joseph and benjamin to joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim whom asenath the daughter of

the souls who came with jacob into egypt who were his direct descendants besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were sixty six the sons of joseph who were born to him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob who came into egypt were seventy he sent judah before him to joseph to show the way before him to goshen and they came into the land of goshen joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet israel his father in goshen he presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while israel said to joseph now let me die since i have seen your face that you are still alive joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers house i will go up and speak with pharaoh and will tell him my brothers and my fathers house who were in the land of canaan have come to me these men are shepherds for they have been keepers of livestock and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have it will happen when pharaoh summons you and will say what is your occupation that you shall say your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now both we and our fathers that you may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the egyptians then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said my father and my brothers with their flocks their herds and all that they own have come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to pharaoh pharaoh said to his brothers what is your occupation they said to pharaoh your servants are shepherds both we and our fathers they said to pharaoh we have come to live as foreigners in the land for there is no pasture for your servants flocks for the famine is severe in the land of canaan now therefore please let your servants dwell in the land of goshen pharaoh spoke to joseph saying your father and your brothers have come to you the land of egypt is before you make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land let them dwell in the land of goshen if you know any able men among them then put them in charge of my livestock joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh pharaoh said to jacob how many are the days of the years of your life jacob said to pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh joseph placed his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded joseph nourished his father his brothers and all of his fathers household with bread according to their families there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very severe so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the grain which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came to joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in your presence for our money fails joseph said give me your livestock and i will give you food for your livestock if your money is gone they brought their livestock to joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks and for the herds and for the donkeys and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year when that year was ended they came to him the second year and said to him we will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent and the herds of livestock are my lords there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands why should we die before your eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants to pharaoh give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land wont be desolate so joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for every man of the egyptians sold his field because the famine was severe on them and the land became pharaohs as for the people he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end of it only he didnt buy the land of the priests for the priests had a portion from pharaoh and ate their portion which pharaoh gave them that is why they didnt sell their land then joseph said to the people behold i have bought you and your land today for pharaoh behold here is seed for you and you shall sow the land it will happen at the harvests that you shall give a fifth to pharaoh and four parts will be your own for seed of the field for your food for them of your households and for food for your little ones they said you have saved our lives let us find favor in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants joseph made it a statute concerning the land of egypt to this day that pharaoh should have the fifth only the land of the priests alone didnt become pharaohs parashat vay i israel lived in the land of egypt in the land of goshen and they got themselves possessions therein and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the days of jacob the years of his life were one hundred forty seven years the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said to him if now i have found favor in your sight please put your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me please dont bury me in egypt but when i sleep with my fathers you shall carry me out of egypt and bury me in their burying place he said i will do as you have said he said swear to me and he swore to him israel bowed himself on the beds head it happened after these things that someone said to joseph behold your father is sick he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim someone told jacob and said behold your son joseph comes to you and israel strengthened himself and sat on the bed jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me and said to me behold i will make you fruitful and multiply you and i will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession now your two sons who were born to you in the land of egypt before i came to you into egypt are mine ephraim and manasseh even as reuben and simeon will be mine your issue whom you become the father of after them will be yours they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance as for me when i came from paddan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when there was still some distance to come to ephrath and i buried her there in the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem israel saw josephs sons and said who are these joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god has given me here he said please bring them to me and i will bless them now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he couldnt see he brought them near to him and he kissed them and embraced them israel said to joseph i didnt think i would see your face and behold god has let me see your seed also joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near to him israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand on manassehs head guiding his hands knowingly for manasseh was the firstborn he blessed joseph and said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has fed me all my life long to this day the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of ephraim it displeased him he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head to manassehs head joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put your right hand on his head his father refused and said i know my son i know he also will become a people and he also will be great however his younger brother will be greater than he and his seed will become a multitude of nations he blessed them that day saying in you will israel bless saying god make you as ephraim and as manasseh he set ephraim before manasseh israel said to joseph behold i am dying but god will be with you and bring you again to the land of your fathers moreover i have given to you one portion above your brothers which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow jacob called to his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come assemble yourselves and hear you sons of jacob listen to israel your father reuben you are my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength excelling in dignity and excelling in power boiling over as water you shall not excel because you went up to your fathers bed then defiled it he went up to my couch simeon and levi are brothers their swords are weapons of violence my soul dont come into their council my glory dont be united to their assembly for in their anger they killed men in their self will they hamstrung cattle cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel judah your brothers will praise you your hand will be on the neck of your enemies your fathers sons will bow down before you judah is a lions cub from the prey my son you have gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion as a lioness who will rouse him up the scepter will not depart from judah nor the rulers staff from between his feet until he comes to whom it belongs to him will the obedience of the peoples be binding his foal to the vine his donkeys colt to the choice vine he has washed his garments in wine his robes in the blood of grapes his eyes will be red with wine his teeth white with milk zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea he will be for a haven of ships his border will be on sidon issachar is a strong donkey lying down between the saddlebags he saw a resting place that it was good the land that it was pleasant he bows his shoulder to the burden and becomes a servant doing forced labor dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of israel dan will be a serpent in the way an adder in the path that bites the horses heels so that his rider falls backward i have waited for your salvation the lord a troop will press on gad but he will press on their heel ashers food will be rich he will yield royal dainties naphtali is a doe set free who bears beautiful fawns joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful vine by a spring his branches run over the wall the archers have severely grieved him shot at him and persecute him but his bow remained strong the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty one of jacob from there is the shepherd the stone of israel even by the god of your father who will help you by the almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lies below blessings of the breasts and of the womb the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors above the boundaries of the ancient hills they will be on the head of joseph on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning he will devour the prey at evening he will divide the spoil all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them he blessed everyone according to his blessing he instructed them and said to them i am to be gathered to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field from ephron the hittite as a burial place there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah the field and the cave that is therein which was purchased from the children of heth when jacob made an end of charging his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the spirit and was gathered to his people joseph fell on his fathers face wept on him and kissed him joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel forty days were fulfilled for him for that is how many the days it takes to embalm the egyptians wept for him for seventy days when the days of weeping for him were past joseph spoke to the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found favor in your eyes please speak in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying behold i am dying bury me in my grave which i have dug for myself in the land of canaan now therefore please let me go up and bury my father and i will come again pharaoh said go up and bury your father just like he made you swear joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house all the elders of the land of egypt all the house of joseph his brothers and his fathers house only their little ones their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen there went up with him both chariots and horsemen it was a very great company they came to the threshing floor of atad which is beyond the jordan and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation he mourned for his father seven days when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning by the egyptians therefore its name was called abel mizraim which is beyond the jordan his sons did to him just as he commanded them for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial site from ephron the hittite before mamre joseph returned into egypt he and his brothers and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father when josephs brothers saw that their father was dead they said it may be that joseph will hate us and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him they sent a message to joseph saying your father commanded before he died saying you shall tell joseph now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers and their sin because they did evil to you now please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the god of your father joseph wept when they spoke to him his brothers also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we are your servants joseph said to them dont be afraid for am i in the place of god as for you you meant evil against me but god meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save many people alive now therefore dont be afraid i will nourish you and your little ones he comforted them and spoke kindly to them joseph lived in egypt he and his fathers house joseph lived one hundred ten years joseph saw ephraims children to the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born on josephs knees joseph
