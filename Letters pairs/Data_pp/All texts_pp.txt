genesis parashat bereishit the seven days of creation in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now the earth was formless and empty with darkness over the surface of the deep and gods wind was hovering over the surface of the waters god said let there be light and there was light god saw that the light was good and god divided the light from the darkness god called the light day and the darkness he called night there was evening and there was morning a first day p god said let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters and let it divide water from water god made the expanse and divided the water which was under the expanse from the water which was above the expanse and it was so god called the expanse heaven there was evening and there was morning a second day p god said let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place and let the dry land appear and it was so god called the dry land earth and the gathering of the waters he called seas and god saw that it was good god said let the earth yield grass herbs yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind with its seed in it on the earth and it was so the earth yielded grass herbs yielding seed after their kind and trees bearing fruit with its seed in it after their kind and god saw that it was good there was evening and there was morning a third day p god said let there be lights in the expanse of heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be signs for the seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the expanse of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so god made the two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars god set them in the expanse of heaven to give light to the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good there was evening and there was morning a fourth day p god said let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth in the expanse of heaven god created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves with which the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged bird after its kind god saw that it was good god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the birds multiply on the earth there was evening and there was morning a fifth day p god said let the earth produce living creatures after their kind livestock creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind and it was so god made the beasts of the earth after their kind and the livestock after their kind and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind and god saw that it was good god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth god created the man in his image in gods image he created him male and female he created them god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth god said behold i have given you every herb yielding seed on the surface of all the earth and every tree bearing fruit yielding seed it will be yours for food to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth in which there is the breath of life i have given every green herb for food and it was so god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good there was evening and there was morning the sixth day p the heavens and the earth were finished and all their legions on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made and he ceased on the seventh day from all his work which he had made god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because in it he ceased from all his work that he had created to do the garden of eden p this is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created on the day the lord god made earth and heaven no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for the lord god had not caused it to rain on the earth and there was no man to till the ground but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground the lord god formed the man from the dust of the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living creature the lord god planted a garden in eden in the east and there he put the man whom he had formed out of the ground the lord god made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food with the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil a river goes out of eden to water the garden and from there it parts and becomes four heads the name of the first is pishon that is the one which flows through the whole land of havilah where there is gold the gold of that land is good bdellium is there and lapis lazuli the name of the second river is gihon the one that winds through the whole land of cush the name of the third river is hiddekel the one which flows east of assyria and the fourth river is the euphrates the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to work it and to keep it the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may surely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die the lord god said it is not good for the man to be alone i will make him a fitting helper the lord god formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them whatever the man called every living creature that was its name the man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field but for the man there was not found a fitting helper the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place he made the rib which the lord god had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she will be called woman ishah for from man ish was she taken therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will join with his wife and they will become one flesh they were both naked the man and his wife yet they were not ashamed now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts which the lord god had made he said to the woman has god really said you shall not eat of any tree of the garden the woman said to the serpent of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may surely eat but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die the serpent said to the woman you will surely not die for god knows that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise she took of its fruit and ate and she gave some to her husband beside her and he ate the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loinclothes they heard the sound of the lord god walking in the garden in the breeze of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden the lord god called to the man and said to him where are you the man said i heard your sound in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and hid myself god said who told you that you were naked have you eaten of the tree that i commanded you not to eat from the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me of the tree and i ate the lord god said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent deceived me and i ate the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are more cursed that all livestock and above every beast of the field on your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust all the days of your life i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring he will bruise your head and you will bruise his heel s to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth in pain will you bear children your longing will be for your husband and he will rule you s to the man he said because you heeded the voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground because of you in toil you will eat from it all the days of your life it will yield thorns and thistles to you and you will eat the herb of the field by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground for from it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return the man called his wife eve because she was the mother of all that lives the lord god made coats of skins for adam and for his wife and clothed them p the lord god said see the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil now what if he should reach out his hand and take as well of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him out of the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed the cherubs at the east of the garden of eden and the flame of the revolving sword to guard the way to the tree of life cain and abel s now the man had known eve his wife she conceived and gave birth to cain saying i have gotten a man with the lords help again she gave birth to cains brother abel abel became a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground after some years it happened that cain brought an offering to the lord from the fruit of the ground abel too brought from the choice firstlings of his flock and of its fat the lord accepted abel and his offering but cain and his offering he did not accept cain was very angry and his face fell the lord said to cain why are you angry and why has your face fallen surely if you do well there will be lifting up but if you do not do well sin crouches at the door its longing is for you yet you can master it cain said to abel his brother and when they were in the field cain rose up against abel his brother and killed him the lord said to cain where is abel your brother he said i do not know am i my brothers keeper the lord said what have you done the voice of your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground now you are cursed through the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand when you till the ground it will not yield its strength to you you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth cain said to the lord my punishment is too great to bear for you have driven me out this day from upon the surface of the ground and i must hide from your face i will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth and whoever finds me will kill me the lord said to him therefore whoever slays cain vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold the lord put a mark on cain lest any finding him should strike him cain left the lords presence and dwelt in the land of nod east of eden cain knew his wife and she conceived and gave birth to enoch he became the builder of a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch to enoch was born irad and irad begot mehujael and mehujael begot methushael and methushael begot lamech lamech took himself two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other was zillah adah bore jabal

instrument of brass and iron tubal cains sister was naamah lamech said to his wives adah and zillah hear my voice you wives of lamech give ear to my speech for i have slain a man for wounding me a young man for bruising me if cain will be avenged seven times then lamech seventy and seven times adam knew his wife again and she bore a son and called him seth for god has given me other seed instead of abel for cain killed him there was also born a son to seth and he named him enosh it was then that men began to call on the name of the lord from adam to noah s this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man he made him in gods likeness he created them male and female and blessed them and called their name adam on the day they were created adam lived one

too is flesh his days will be one hundred and twenty years the nephilim were in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god took the daughters of men they bore them children those were the mighty men who were of old men of renown p the lord saw that the evil of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually the lord regretted that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him in his heart the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the surface of the ground from man to cattle to creeping things to the birds of the heavens for i regret that i made them but noah found favor in the eyes of the lord parashat noah this is the history of the generations of noah noah was a righteous man blameless among the people of his time noah walked with god noah became the father of three sons shem ham and japheth the earth was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence god saw the earth

an altar to the lord and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar the lord smelled the pleasant aroma the lord said in his heart i will not again

and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease god blessed noah and his sons and said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth the fear of you

that lives will be food for you as the green herb i have given everything to you but flesh with its life its blood you shall not eat i will surely require your blood of your lives at the hand of every animal i will require it at the hand of man even at the hand of every mans brother i will require the life of man whoever sheds mans blood his blood will be shed by man for god made man in his own image be fruitful and multiply increase abundantly in the earth and multiply in it god spoke to noah and to his sons with him saying as for me behold i establish my covenant with you and with your

their families after their languages in their lands after their nations these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood the whole earth was of one language and of one speech it happened as they traveled east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they lived there they said one to another come lets make bricks and burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone and they used tar for mortar they said come lets build ourselves a city and a tower whose top reaches to the sky and lets make ourselves a name lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built the lord said behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is what they begin to do now nothing will be withheld from them which they intend to do come lets go down and there confuse their language that they may not understand one anothers speech so the lord scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth they stopped building the city therefore its name was called babel because there the

also who went with abram had flocks and herds and tents the land was not able to bear them that they might live together for their substance was great so that they could not live together there was a strife between the herdsmen of abrams livestock and the herdsmen of lots livestock and the canaanite and the perizzite lived in the land at that time abram said to lot please let there be no strife between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen for we are relatives isnt the whole land before you please separate yourself from me if you go to the left hand then i will go to the right or if you go to the right hand then i will go to the left lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah

in the land of canaan and lot lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as sodom now the men of sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against the lord the lord said to abram after

king of sodom i have lifted up my hand to the lord god most high possessor of heaven and earth that i will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours lest you should say i have made abram rich i will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying dont be afraid abram i am your shield your exceedingly great reward abram said lord the lord what will you give me since i go childless and he who will inherit my estate is eliezer of damascus abram said behold to me you have given no seed and behold one born in my house is my heir behold the word of the lord came to him saying this man will not be your heir but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir the lord brought him outside and said look now toward the sky and count the stars if you are able to count them he said to abram so shall your seed be he believed in the lord and he reckoned it to him for righteousness he said to him i am the lord who brought you out of ur of the chaldees to give you this land to inherit it he said lord god how will i know that i will inherit it he said to him bring me a heifer three years old a female goat three years old a ram three years old a turtledove and a young pigeon he brought him all of these and divided them in the middle and laid each half opposite the other but he didnt divide the birds the birds of prey came down on the carcasses and abram drove them away when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell on abram now terror and great darkness fell on him he said to abram know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs and will serve them they will afflict them four hundred years i will also judge that nation whom they will serve afterward they will come out with great wealth but you will go to your fathers in peace you will be buried in a good old age in the fourth generation they will come here again for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between these pieces in that day the lord made a covenant with abram saying to your seed i have given this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphrates the kenites the kenizzites the kadmonites the hittites the perizzites the rephaim the amorites the canaanites the girgashites and the jebusites now sarai abrams wife bore him no children she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar sarai said to abram see now the lord has restrained me from bearing please go in to my handmaid it may be that i will obtain children by her abram listened to the voice of sarai sarai abrams wife took hagar the egyptian her handmaid after abram had lived ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to abram her husband to be his wife he went in to hagar and she conceived when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes sarai said to abram this wrong is your fault i gave my handmaid into your bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and you but abram said to sarai behold your maid is in your hand do to her whatever is good in your eyes sarai dealt harshly with her and she fled from her face the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur he said hagar sarais handmaid where did you come from where are you going she said i am fleeing from the face of my mistress sarai the angel of the lord said to her return to your mistress and submit yourself under her hands the angel of the lord said to her i will greatly multiply your seed that they will not be numbered for multitude the angel of the lord said to her behold you are with child and will bear a son you shall call his name ishmael because the lord has heard your affliction he will be like a wild donkey among men his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him he will live opposite all of his brothers she called the name of the lord who spoke to her you are a god who sees for she said have i even stayed alive after seeing him therefore the well was called beer lahai roi behold it is between kadesh and bered hagar bore a son for abram abram called the name of his son whom hagar bore ishmael abram was eighty six years old when hagar bore ishmael to abram when abram was ninety nine years old the lord appeared to abram and said to him i am god almighty walk before me and be blameless i will make my covenant between me and you and will multiply you exceedingly abram fell on his face god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with you you will be the father of a multitude of nations neither will your name any more be called abram but your name will be abraham for i have made you the father of a multitude of nations i will make you exceedingly fruitful and i will make nations of you kings will come out of you i will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god to you and to your seed after you i will give to you and to your seed after you the land where you are traveling all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession i will be their god god said to abraham as for you you will keep my covenant you and your seed after you throughout their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and your seed after you every male among you shall be circumcised you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin it will be a token of the covenant between me and you he who is eight days old will be circumcised among you every male throughout your generations he who is born in the house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised my covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant god said to abraham as for sarai your wife you shall not call her name sarai but her name will be sarah i will bless her and moreover i will give you a son by her yes i will bless her and she will be a mother of nations kings of peoples will come from her then abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old will sarah who is ninety years old give birth abraham said to god oh that ishmael might live before you god said no but sarah your wife will bear you a son you shall call his name isaac i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him as for ishmael i have heard you behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly he will become the father of twelve princes and i will make him a great nation but my covenant i establish with isaac whom sarah will bear to you at this set time next year when he finished talking with him god went up from abraham abraham took ishmael his son all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day as god had said to him abraham was ninety nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin in the same day both abraham and ishmael his son were circumcised all the men of his house those born in the house and those bought with money of a foreigner were circumcised with him parashat vayera the lord appeared to him by the oaks of mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day he lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that three men stood opposite him when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the earth and said my lord if now i have found favor in your sight please dont go away from your servant now let a little water be fetched wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree i will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart after that you may go your way now that you have come to your servant they said very well do as you have said abraham hurried into the tent to sarah and said quickly prepare three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes abraham ran to the herd and fetched a tender and good calf and gave it to the servant he hurried to dress it he took butter milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them he stood by them under the tree and they ate they asked him where is sarah your wife he said see in the tent he said i will certainly return to you when the season comes round behold sarah your wife will have a son sarah heard in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old well advanced in age sarah had passed the age of childbearing sarah laughed within herself saying after i have grown old will i have pleasure my lord being old also the lord said to abraham why did sarah laugh saying will i really bear a child yet i am old is anything too hard for the lord at the set time i will return to you when the season comes round and sarah will have a son then sarah denied saying i didnt laugh for she was afraid he said no but you did laugh the men rose up from there and looked toward sodom abraham went with them to see them on their way the lord said will i hide from abraham what i do since abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him for i have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him that they may keep the way of the lord to do righteousness and justice to the end that the lord may bring on abraham that which he has spoken of him the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous i will go down now and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me if not i will know the men turned from there and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord abraham drew near and said will you consume the righteous with the wicked what if there are fifty righteous within the city will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it be it far from you to do things like that to kill the righteous with the wicked so that the righteous should be like the wicked may that be far from you shouldnt the judge of all the earth do right the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sake abraham answered see now i have taken it on myself to speak to the lord who am but dust and ashes what if there will lack five of the fifty righteous will you destroy all the city for lack of five he said i will not destroy it if i find forty five there he spoke to him yet again and said what if there are forty found there he said i will not do it for the fortys sake he said oh dont let the lord be angry and i will speak what if there are thirty found there he said i will not do it if i find thirty there he said see now i have taken it on myself to speak to the lord what if there are twenty found there he said i will not destroy it for the twentys sake he said oh dont let the lord be angry and i will speak just once more what if ten are found there he said i will not destroy it for the tens sake the lord went his way as soon as he had finished communing with abraham and abraham returned to his place the two angels came to sodom at evening lot sat in the gate of sodom lot saw them and rose up to meet them he bowed himself with his face to the earth and he said see now my lords please turn aside into your servants house stay all night wash your feet and you can rise up early and go on your way they said no but we will stay in the street all night he urged them greatly and they came in with him and entered into his house he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread and they ate but before they lay down the men of the city the men of sodom surrounded the house both young and old all the people from every quarter they called to lot and said to him where are the men who came in to you this night bring them out to us that we may have sex with them lot went out to them to the door and shut the door after him he said please my brothers dont act so wickedly see now i have two virgin daughters please let me bring them out to you and you may do to them what seems good to you only dont do anything to these men because they have come under the shadow of my roof they said stand back then they said this one fellow came in to live as a foreigner and he appoints himself a judge now will we deal worse with you than with them they pressed hard on the man lot and drew near to break the door but the men reached out their hand and brought lot into the house to them and shut the door they struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door the men said to lot do you have anybody else here sons in law your sons your daughters and whoever you have in the city bring them out of the place for we will destroy this place because the outcry against them has grown great before the lord that the lord has sent us to destroy it lot went out and spoke to his sons in law who were pledged to marry his daughters and said get up get out of this place for the lord will destroy the city but he seemed to his sons in law to be joking when the morning came then the angels hurried lot saying get up take your wife and your two daughters who are here lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city but he lingered and the men grabbed his hand his wifes hand and his two daughters hands the lord being merciful to him and they took him out and set him outside of the city it came to pass when they had taken them out that he said escape for your life dont look behind you and dont stay anywhere in the plain escape to the mountains lest you be consumed lot said to them oh not so my lord see now your servant has found favor in your sight and you have magnified your loving kindness which you have shown to me in saving my life i cant escape to the mountain lest evil overtake me and i die see now this city is near to flee to and it is a little one oh let me escape there isnt it a little one and my soul will live he said to him behold i have granted your request concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken hurry escape there for i cant do anything until you get there therefore the name of the city was called zoar the sun had risen on the earth when lot came to zoar then the lord rained on sodom and on gomorrah sulfur and fire from the lord out of the sky he overthrew those cities all the plain all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew on the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the lord he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and looked and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace it happened when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot lived lot went up out of zoar and lived in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he was afraid to live in zoar he lived in a cave with his two daughters the firstborn said to the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth come lets make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve our fathers seed they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father he didnt know when she lay down nor when she arose it came to pass on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger behold i lay last night with my father let us make him drink wine again tonight you go in and lie with him that we may preserve our fathers seed they made their father drink wine that night also the younger went and lay with him he didnt know when she lay down nor when she got up thus both of lots daughters were with child by their father the firstborn bore a son and named him moab he is the father of the moabites to this day the younger also bore a son and called his name ben ammi he is the father of the children of ammon to this day abraham traveled from there toward the land of the south and lived between kadesh and shur he lived as a foreigner in gerar abraham said about sarah his wife she is my sister abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a mans wife now abimelech had not come near her he said lord will you kill even a righteous nation didnt he tell me she is my sister she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have i done this god said to him in the dream yes i know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this and i also withheld you from sinning against me therefore i didnt allow you to touch her now therefore restore the mans wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live if you dont restore her know for sure that you will die you and all who are yours abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ear the men were very scared then abimelech called abraham and said to him what have you done to us how have i sinned against you that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done abimelech said to abraham what did you see that you have done this thing abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place they will kill me for my wifes sake besides she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife it happened when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said to her this is your kindness which you shall show to me everywhere that we go say of me he is my brother abimelech took sheep and cattle male servants and female servants and gave them to abraham and restored sarah his wife to him abimelech said behold my land is before you dwell where it pleases you to sarah he said behold i have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver behold it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you in front of all you are vindicated abraham prayed to god god healed abimelech and his wife and his female servants and they bore children for the lord had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did to sarah as he had spoken sarah conceived and bore abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him abraham called his son who was born to him whom sarah bore to him isaac abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old as god had commanded him abraham was one hundred years old when his son isaac was born to him sarah said god has made me laugh everyone who hears will laugh with me she said who would have said to abraham that sarah would nurse children for i have borne him a son in his old age the child grew and was weaned abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian whom she had borne to abraham mocking therefore she said to abraham cast out this handmaid and her son for the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son isaac the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight on account of his son god said to abraham dont let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy and because of your handmaid in all that sarah says to you listen to her voice for from isaac will your seed be called i will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid because he is your seed abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it to hagar putting it on her shoulder and gave her the child and sent her away she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba the water in the bottle was spent and she cast the child under one of the shrubs she went and sat down opposite him a good way off about a bow shot away for she said dont let me see the death of the child she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept god heard the voice of the boy the angel of god called to hagar out of the sky and said to her what ails you hagar dont be afraid for god has heard the voice of the boy where he is get up lift up the boy and hold him in your hand for i will make him a great nation god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water she went filled the bottle with water and gave the boy drink god was with the boy and he grew he lived in the wilderness and became as he grew up an archer he lived in the wilderness of paran his mother took a wife for him out of the land of egypt it happened at that time that abimelech and phicol the captain of his army spoke to abraham saying god is with you in all that you do now therefore swear to me here by god that you will not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that i have done to you you shall do to me and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner abraham said i will swear abraham complained to abimelech because of a water well which abimelechs servants had violently taken away abimelech said i dont know who has done this thing you didnt tell me neither did i hear of it until today abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to abimelech those two made a covenant abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves abimelech said to abraham what do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean he said you shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand that it may be a witness to me that i have dug this well therefore he called that place beersheba because they both swore there so they made a covenant at beersheba abimelech rose up with phicol the captain of his army and they returned into the land of the philistines abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the philistines many days it happened after these things that god tested abraham and said to him abraham he said here i am he said now take your son your only son whom you love even isaac and go into the land of moriah offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which i will tell you of abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son he split the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went to the place of which god had told him on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey the boy and i will go yonder we will worship and come back to you abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on isaac his son he took in his hand the fire and the knife they both went together isaac spoke to abraham his father and said my father he said here i am my son he said here is the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering abraham said god will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering my son so they both went together they came to the place which god had told him of abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar on the wood abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to kill his son the angel of the lord called to him out of the sky and said abraham abraham he said here i am he said dont lay your hand on the boy neither do anything to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son abraham called the name of that place the lord will provide as it is said to this day on the lords mountain it will be provided the angel of the lord called to abraham a second time out of the sky and said i have sworn by myself says the lord because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son your only son that i will bless you greatly and i will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore your seed will possess the gate of his enemies in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed because you have obeyed my voice so abraham returned to his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba abraham lived at beersheba it happened after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she also has borne children to your brother nahor uz his firstborn buz his brother kemuel the father of aram chesed hazo pildash jidlaph and bethuel bethuel became the father of rebekah these eight milcah bore to nahor abrahams brother his concubine whose name was reumah also bore tebah gaham tahash and maacah parashat ayyei sarah sarah lived one hundred twenty seven years this was the length of sarahs life sarah died in kiriath arba the same is hebron in the land of canaan abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke to the children of heth saying i am a stranger and a foreigner living with you give me a possession of a burying place with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight the children of heth answered abraham saying to him hear us my lord you are a prince of god among us bury your dead in the best of our tombs none of us will withhold from you his tomb bury your dead abraham rose up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth he talked with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he has which is in the end of his field for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying place now ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of heth ephron the hittite answered abraham in the hearing of the children of heth even of all who went in at the gate of his city saying no my lord hear me i give you the field and i give you the cave that is in it in the presence of the children of my people i give it to you bury your dead abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land he spoke to ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if you will please hear me i will give the price of the field take it from me and i will bury my dead there ephron answered abraham saying to him my lord listen to me what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you therefore bury your dead abraham listened to ephron abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of heth four hundred shekels of silver according to the current merchants standard so the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field that were in all of its borders were deeded to abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all who went in at the gate of his city after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre that is hebron in the land of canaan the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of heth abraham was old and well stricken in age the lord had blessed abraham in all things abraham said to his servant the elder of his house who ruled over all that he had please put your hand under my thigh i will make you swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i live but you shall go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son isaac the servant said to him what if the woman isnt willing to follow me to this land must i bring your son again to the land you came from abraham said to him beware that you dont bring my son there again the lord the god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth who spoke to me and who swore to me saying i will give this land to your seed he will send his angel before you and you shall take a wife for my son from there if the woman isnt willing to follow you then you shall be clear from this my oath only you shall not bring my son there again the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter the servant took ten camels of his masters camels and departed having a variety of good things of his masters with him he arose and went to mesopotamia to the city of nahor he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time that women go out to draw water he said the lord the god of my master abraham please give me success this day and show kindness to my master abraham behold i am standing by the spring of water the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water let it happen that the young lady to whom i will say please let down your pitcher that i may drink and she will say drink and i will also give your camels a drink let her be the one you have appointed for your servant isaac by this i will know that you have shown kindness to my master it happened before he had finished speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel the son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher on her shoulder the young lady was very beautiful to look at a virgin neither had any man known her she went down to the spring filled her pitcher and came up the servant ran to meet her and said please give me a drink a little water from your pitcher she said drink my lord she hurried and let down her pitcher on her hand and gave him drink when she had done giving him drink she said i will also draw for your camels until they have done drinking she hurried and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again to the well to draw and drew for all his camels the man looked steadfastly at her remaining silent to know whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not it happened as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter are you please tell me is there room in your fathers house for us to lodge in she said to him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bore to nahor she said moreover to him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in the man bowed his head and worshiped the lord he said blessed be the lord the god of my master abraham who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master as for me the lord has led me in the way to the house of my masters relatives the young lady ran and told her mothers house about these words rebekah had a brother and his name was laban laban ran out to the man to the spring it happened when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying this is what the man said to me that he came to the man behold he was standing by the camels at the spring he said come in you blessed of the lord why do you stand outside for i have prepared the house and room for the camels the man came into the house and he unloaded the camels he gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him

with her ladies they rode on the camels and followed the man the servant took rebekah and went his way isaac came from the way of beer lahai roi for he lived in the land of the south isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she dismounted from the camel she said to the servant who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us the servant said it is my master she took her veil and covered herself the servant told isaac all the things that he had done isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife he loved her isaac was comforted after his mothers death abraham took another wife and her name was keturah she bore

purchased of the children of heth abraham was buried there with sarah his wife it happened after the death of abraham that god blessed isaac his son isaac lived by beer lahai roi now this is the history of the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bore to abraham these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to the order of their birth the firstborn of ishmael nebaioth then kedar adbeel mibsam mishma dumah massa hadad tema jetur naphish and kedemah these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their villages and

they lived from havilah to shur that is before egypt as you go toward assyria he lived opposite all his relatives parashat toledot this is the history of the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham became the father of isaac isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the syrian of paddan aram the sister of laban the syrian to be his wife isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren the lord was entreated by him and rebekah his wife conceived the children struggled together within her she said if it be so why do i live she went to inquire of the lord the lord said to her two nations are in your womb two peoples will be separated from your body the one people will be stronger than the other people the elder will serve the younger when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb the first came out red all over like a hairy garment they named him esau after that his brother came out and his hand had hold on esaus heel he was named jacob isaac was sixty years old when she bore them the boys grew esau was a skillful hunter a man of the field jacob was a quiet man living in tents now isaac loved esau because he ate his venison rebekah loved jacob jacob boiled stew esau came in from the field and he was famished esau said to jacob please feed me with that same red stew for i am famished therefore his name was called edom jacob said first sell me your birthright esau said behold i am about to die what good is the birthright to me jacob said swear to me first he swore to him he sold his birthright to jacob jacob gave esau bread and stew of lentils he ate and drank rose up and went his way so esau despised his birthright there was a famine in the land besides the first famine that was in the days of abraham isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines to gerar the lord appeared to him and said dont go down into egypt live in the land i will tell you about live in this land and i will be with you and will bless you for to you and to your seed i will give all these lands and i will establish the oath which i swore to abraham your father i will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky and will give to your seed all these lands in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed because abraham obeyed my voice and kept my requirements my commandments my statutes and my laws isaac lived in gerar the men of the place asked him about his wife he said she is my sister for he was afraid to say my wife lest he thought the men of the place might kill me for rebekah because she is beautiful to look at it happened when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was caressing rebekah his wife abimelech called isaac and said behold surely she is your wife why did you say she is my sister isaac said to him because i said lest i die because of her abimelech said what is this you have done to us one of the people might easily have lain with your wife and you would have brought guilt on us abimelech commanded all the people saying he who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted the lord blessed him the man grew great and grew more and more until he became very great he had possessions of flocks possessions of herds and a great household the philistines envied him now all the wells which his fathers servants had dug in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped and filled with earth abimelech said to isaac go from us for you are much mightier than we isaac departed from there encamped in the valley of gerar and lived there isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham he called their names after the names by which his father had called them isaacs servants dug in the valley and found there a well of springing water the herdsmen of gerar argued with isaacs herdsmen saying the water is ours he called the name of the well esek because they contended with him they dug another well and they argued over that also he called its name sitnah he left that place and dug another well they didnt argue over that one he called it rehoboth he said for now the lord has made room for us and we will be fruitful in the land he went up from there to beersheba the lord appeared to him the same night and said i am the god of abraham your father dont be afraid for i am with you and will bless you and multiply your seed for my servant abrahams sake he built an altar there and called on the name of the lord and pitched his tent there there isaacs servants dug a well then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his army isaac said to them why have you come to me since you hate me and have sent me away from you they said we saw plainly that the lord was with you we said let there now be an oath between us even between us and you and let us make a covenant with you that you will do us no harm as we have not touched you and as we have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace you are now the blessed of the lord he made them a feast and they ate and drank they rose up some time in the morning and swore one to another isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace it happened the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had dug and said to him we have found water he called it shibah therefore the name of the city is beersheba to this day when esau was forty years old he took as wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite they grieved isaacs and rebekahs spirits it happened that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his elder son and said to him my son he said to him here i am he said see now i am old i dont know the day of my death now therefore please take your weapons your quiver and your bow and go out to the field and take me venison make me savory food such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat and that my soul may bless you before i die rebekah heard when isaac spoke to esau his son esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it rebekah spoke to jacob her son saying behold i heard your father speak to esau your brother saying bring me venison and make me savory food that i may eat and bless you before the lord before my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command you go now to the flock and get me from there two good young goats i will make them savory food for your father such as he loves you shall bring it to your father that he may eat so that he may bless you before his death jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man what if my father touches me i will seem to him as a deceiver and i would bring a curse on myself and not a blessing his mother said to him let your curse be on me my son only obey my voice and go get them for me he went and got them and brought them to his mother his mother made savory food such as his father loved rebekah took the good clothes of esau her elder son which were with her in the house and put them on jacob her younger son she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth of his neck she gave the savory food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob he came to his father and said my father he said here i am who are you my son jacob said to his father i am esau your firstborn i have done what you asked me to do please arise sit and eat of my venison that your soul may bless me isaac said to his son how is it that you have found it so quickly my son he said because the lord your god gave me success isaac said to jacob please come near that i may feel you my son whether you are really my son esau or not jacob went near to isaac his father he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau he didnt recognize him because his hands were hairy like his brother esaus hands so he blessed him he said are you really my son esau he said i am he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless you he brought it near to him and he ate he brought him wine and he drank his father isaac said to him come near now and kiss me my son he came near and kissed him he smelled the smell of his clothing and blessed him and said behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord has blessed god give you of the dew of the sky of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and new wine let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you be lord over your brothers let your mothers sons bow down to you cursed be everyone who curses you blessed be everyone who blesses you it happened as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob had just gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting he also made savory food and brought it to his father he said to his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that your soul may bless me isaac his father said to him who are you he said i am your son your firstborn esau isaac trembled violently and said who then is he who has taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before you came and have blessed him yes he will be blessed when esau heard the words of his father he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry and said to his father bless me even me also my father he said your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing he said isnt he rightly named jacob for he has supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright see now he has taken away my blessing he said havent you reserved a blessing for me isaac answered esau behold i have made him your lord and all his brothers have i given to him for servants with grain and new wine have i sustained him what then will i do for you my son esau said to his father have you but one blessing my father bless me even me also my father esau lifted up his voice and wept isaac his father answered him behold of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling and of the dew of the sky from above by your sword will you live and you will serve your brother it will happen when you will break loose that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck esau hated jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then i will kill my brother jacob the words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah she sent and called jacob her younger son and said to him behold your brother esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee to laban my brother in haran stay with him a few days until your brothers fury turns away until your brothers anger turn away from you and he forgets what you have done to him then i will send and get you from there why should i be bereaved of you both in one day rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob takes a wife of the daughters of heth such as these of the daughters of the land what good will my life do me isaac called jacob blessed him and commanded him you shall not take a wife of the daughters of canaan arise go to paddan aram to the house of bethuel your mothers father take a wife from there from the daughters of laban your mothers brother may god almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you that you may be a company of peoples and give you the blessing of abraham to you and to your seed with you that you may inherit the land where you travel which god gave to abraham isaac sent jacob away he went to paddan aram to laban son of bethuel the syrian rebekahs brother jacobs and esaus mother now esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to paddan aram to take him a wife from there and that as he blessed him he gave him a command saying you shall not take a wife of the daughters of canaan and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to paddan aram esau saw that the daughters of canaan didnt please isaac his father esau went to ishmael and took besides the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebaioth to be his wife parashat vaye ei jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran he came to a certain place and stayed there all night because the sun had set he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep he dreamed behold a stairway set upon the earth and its top reached to heaven behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac the land whereon you lie to you will i give it and to your seed your seed will be as the dust of the earth and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed behold i am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you again into this land for i will not leave you until i have done that which i have spoken of to you jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i didnt know it he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other than gods house and this is the gate of heaven jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on its top he called the name of that place bethel but the name of the city was luz at the first jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on so that i come again to my fathers house in peace and the lord will be my god then this stone which i have set up for a pillar will be gods house of all that you will give me i will surely give the tenth to you then jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east he looked and behold a well in the field and behold three flocks of sheep lying there by it for out of that well they watered the flocks the stone on the wells mouth was large there all the flocks were gathered they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again on the wells mouth in its place jacob said to them my relatives where are you from they said we are from haran he said to them do you know laban the son of nahor they said we know him he said to them is it well with him they said it is well see rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep he said behold it is still the middle of the day not time to gather the livestock together water the sheep and go and feed them they said we cant until all the flocks are gathered together and they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept them it happened when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son she ran and told her father it happened when laban heard the news of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet jacob and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house jacob told laban all these things laban said to him surely you are my bone and my flesh he lived with him for a month laban said to jacob because you are my brother should you therefore serve me for nothing tell me what will your wages be laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel leahs eyes were weak but rachel was beautiful in form and attractive jacob loved rachel he said i will serve you seven years for rachel your younger daughter laban said it is better that i give her to you than that i should give her to another man stay with me jacob served seven years for rachel they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had for her jacob said to laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in to her laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast it happened in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him he went in to her laban gave zilpah his handmaid to his daughter leah for a handmaid it happened in the morning that behold it was leah he said to laban what is this you have done to me didnt i serve with you for rachel why then have you deceived me laban said it is not done so in our place to give the younger before the firstborn fulfill the week of this one and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years jacob did so and fulfilled her week he gave him rachel his daughter as wife laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid he went in also to rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years the lord saw that leah was hated and he opened her womb but rachel was barren leah conceived and bore a son and she named him reuben for she said because the lord has looked at my affliction for now my husband will love me she conceived again and bore a son and said because the lord has heard that i am hated he has therefore given me this son also she named him simeon she conceived again and bore a son said now this time will my husband be joined to me because i have borne him three sons therefore his name was called levi she conceived again and bore a son she said this time will i praise the lord therefore she named him judah then she stopped bearing when rachel saw that she bore jacob no children rachel envied her sister she said to jacob give me children or else i will die jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods place who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb she said behold my maid bilhah go in to her that she may bear on my knees and i also may obtain children by her she gave him bilhah her handmaid as wife and jacob went in to her bilhah conceived and bore jacob a son rachel said god has judged me and has also heard my voice and has given me a son therefore called she his name dan bilhah rachels handmaid conceived again and bore jacob a second son rachel said with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and have prevailed she named him naphtali when leah saw that she had finished bearing she took zilpah her handmaid and gave her to jacob as a wife zilpah leahs handmaid bore jacob a son leah said how fortunate she named him gad zilpah leahs handmaid bore jacob a second son leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me happy she named him asher reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother leah then rachel said to leah please give me some of your sons mandrakes she said to her is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband would you take away my sons mandrakes also rachel said therefore he will lie with you tonight for your sons mandrakes jacob came from the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said you must come in to me for i have surely hired you with my sons mandrakes he lay with her that night god listened to leah and she conceived and bore jacob a fifth son leah said god has given me my hire because i gave my handmaid to my husband she named him issachar leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to jacob leah said god has endowed me with a good dowry now my husband will live with me because i have borne him six sons she named him zebulun afterwards she bore a daughter and named her dinah god remembered rachel and god listened to her and opened her womb she conceived bore a son and said god has taken away my reproach she named him joseph saying may the lord add another son to me it happened when rachel had borne joseph that jacob said to laban send me away that i may go to my own place and to my country give me my wives and my children for whom i have served you and let me go for you know my service with which i have served you laban said to him if now i have found favor in your eyes stay here for i have divined that the lord has blessed me for your sake he said appoint me your wages and i will give it he said to him you know how i have served you and how your livestock have fared with me for it was little which you had before i came and it has increased to a multitude the lord has blessed you wherever i turned now when will i provide for my own house also he said what shall i give you jacob said you shall not give me anything if you will do this thing for me i will again feed your flock and keep it i will pass through all your flock today removing from there every speckled and spotted one and every black one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats this will be my hire so my righteousness will answer for me hereafter when you come concerning my hire that is before you every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep that might be with me will be counted stolen laban said behold let it be according to your word that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white in it and all the black ones among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons he set three days journey between himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar almond plane tree peeled white streaks in them and made the white appear which was in the rods he set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink they conceived when they came to drink the flocks conceived before the rods and the flocks produced streaked speckled and spotted jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of laban and he put his own droves apart and didnt put them into labans flock it happened whenever the stronger of the flock conceived that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods but when the flock were feeble he didnt put them in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks female servants and male servants and camels and donkeys he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob has taken away all that was our fathers from that which was our fathers has he gotten all this wealth jacob saw the expression on labans face and behold it was not toward him as before the lord said to jacob return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and i will be with you jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field to his flock and said to them i see the expression on your fathers face that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father has been with me you know that i have served your father with all of my strength your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god didnt allow him to hurt me if he said this the speckled will be your wages then all the flock bore speckled if he said this the streaked will be your wages then all the flock bore streaked thus god has taken away your fathers livestock and given them to me it happened during mating season that i lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream and behold the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked speckled and grizzled the angel of god said to me in the dream jacob and i said here i am he said now lift up your eyes and behold all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban does to you i am the god of bethel where you anointed a pillar where you vowed a vow to me now arise get out from this land and return to the land of your birth rachel and leah answered him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house arent we accounted by him as foreigners for he has sold us and has also quite devoured our money for all the riches which god has taken away from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatever god has said to you do then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives on the camels and he took away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gathered including the livestock which he had gained in paddan aram to go to isaac his father to the land of canaan now laban had gone to shear his sheep and rachel stole the teraphim that were her fathers jacob deceived laban the syrian in that he didnt tell him that he was running away so he fled with all that he had he rose up passed over the river and set his face toward the mountain of gilead laban was told on the third day that jacob had fled he took his relatives with him and pursued after him seven days journey he overtook him in the mountain of gilead god came to laban the syrian in a dream of the night and said to him take heed to yourself that you dont speak to jacob either good or bad laban caught up with jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of gilead laban said to jacob what have you done that you have deceived me and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword why did you flee secretly and deceive me and didnt tell me that i might have sent you away with mirth and with songs with tambourine and with harp and didnt allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters now have you done foolishly it is in the power of my hand to hurt you but the god of your father spoke to me last night saying take heed to yourself that you dont speak to jacob either good or bad now you want to be gone because you greatly longed for your fathers house but why have you stolen my gods jacob answered laban because i was afraid for i said lest you should take your daughters from me by force anyone you find your gods with shall not live before our relatives discern what is yours with me and take it for jacob didnt know that rachel had stolen them laban went into jacobs tent into leahs tent and into the tent of the two female servants but he didnt find them he went out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent now rachel had taken the teraphim put them in the camels saddle and sat on them laban felt about all the tent but didnt find them she said to her father dont let my lord be angry that i cant rise up before you for im having my period he searched but didnt find the teraphim jacob was angry and argued with laban jacob answered laban what is my trespass what is my sin that you have hotly pursued after me now that you have felt around in all my stuff what have you found of all your household stuff set it here before my relatives and your relatives that they may judge between us two these twenty years i have been with you your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young and i havent eaten the rams of your flocks that which was torn of animals i didnt bring to you i bore its loss of my hand you required it whether stolen by day or stolen by night this was my situation in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep fled from my eyes these twenty years i have been in your house i served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock and you have changed my wages ten times unless the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely now you would have sent me away empty god has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night laban answered jacob the daughters are my daughters the children are my children the flocks are my flocks and all that you see is mine and what can i do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne now come let us make a covenant you and i and let it be for a witness between me and you jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar jacob said to his relatives gather stones they took stones and made a heap they ate there by the heap laban called it jegar sahadutha but jacob called it galeed laban said this heap is witness between me and you this day therefore it was named galeed and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and you when we are absent one from another if you afflict my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughters no man is with us behold god is witness between me and you laban said to jacob see this heap and see the pillar which i have set between me and you may this heap be a witness and the pillar be a witness that i will not pass over this heap to you and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me for harm the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge between us then jacob swore by the fear of his father isaac jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and called his relatives to eat bread they ate bread and stayed all night in the mountain early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them laban departed and returned to his place jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him when he saw them jacob said this is gods army he called the name of that place mahanaim parashat vayishla jacob sent messengers in front of him to esau his brother to the land of seir the field of edom he commanded them saying this is what you shall tell my lord esau this is what your servant jacob says i have lived as a foreigner with laban and stayed until now i have cattle donkeys flocks male servants and female servants i have sent to tell my lord that i may find favor in your sight the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to your brother esau not only that but he comes to meet you and four hundred men with him then jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two companies and he said if esau comes to the one company and strikes it then the company which is left will escape jacob said god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord who said to me return to your country and to your relatives and i will do you good i am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses and of all the truth which you have shown to your servant for with just my staff i passed over this jordan and now i have become two companies please deliver me from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children you said i will surely do you good and make your seed as the sand of the sea which cant be numbered because there are so many he lodged there that night and took from that which he had with him a present for esau his brother two hundred female goats and twenty male goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milk camels and their colts forty cows ten bulls twenty female donkeys and ten foals he delivered them into the hands of his servants every herd by itself and said to his servants pass over before me and put a space between herd and herd he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meets you and asks you saying whose are you where are you going whose are these before you then you shall say they are your servant jacobs it is a present sent to my lord esau behold he also is behind us he commanded also the second and the third and all that followed the herds saying this is how you shall speak to esau when you find him you shall say not only that but behold your servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goes before me and afterward i will see his face perhaps he will accept me so the present passed over before him and he himself lodged that night in the camp he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two handmaids and his eleven sons and passed over the ford of the jabbok he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over that which he had jacob was left alone and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day when he saw that he didnt prevail against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was strained as he wrestled the man said let me go for the day breaks jacob said i wont let you go unless you bless me he said to him what is your name he said jacob he said your name will no longer be called jacob but israel for you have fought with god and with men and have prevailed jacob asked him please tell me your name he said why is it that you ask what my name is he blessed him there jacob called the name of the place peniel for he said i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved the sun rose on him as he passed over peniel and he limped because of his thigh therefore the children of israel dont eat the sinew of the hip which is on the hollow of the thigh to this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew of the hip jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau was coming and with him four hundred men he divided the children between leah rachel and the two handmaids he put the handmaids and their children in front leah and her children after and rachel and joseph at the rear he himself passed over in front of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother esau ran to meet him embraced him fell on his neck kissed him and they wept he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are these with you he said the children whom god has graciously given your servant then the handmaids came near with their children and they bowed themselves leah also and her children came near and bowed themselves after them joseph came near with rachel and they bowed themselves esau said what do you mean by all this company which i met jacob said to find favor in the sight of my lord esau said i have enough my brother let that which you have be yours jacob said please no if i have now found favor in your sight then receive my present at my hand because i have seen your face as one sees the face of god and you were pleased with me please take the gift that i brought to you because god has dealt graciously with me and because i have enough he urged him and he took it esau said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before you jacob said to him my lord knows that the children are tender and that the flocks and herds with me have their young and if they overdrive them one day all the flocks will die please let my lord pass over before his servant and i will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children until i come to my lord to seir esau said let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me he said why let me find favor in the sight of my lord so esau returned that day on his way to seir jacob traveled to succoth built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock therefore the name of the place is called succoth jacob came in peace to the city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from paddan aram and encamped before the city he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for one hundred pieces of money he erected an altar there and called it el elohe israel dinah the daughter of leah whom she bore to jacob went out to see the daughters of the land shechem the son of hamor the hivite the prince of the land saw her he took her lay with her and humbled her his soul joined to dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the young lady and spoke kindly to the young lady shechem spoke to his father hamor saying get me this young lady as a wife now jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter and his sons were with his livestock in the field jacob held his peace until they came hamor the father of shechem went out to jacob to talk with him the sons of jacob came in from the field when they heard it the men were grieved and they were very angry because he had done folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter a which thing ought not to be done hamor talked with them saying the soul of my son shechem longs for your daughter please give her to him as a wife make marriages with us give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves you shall dwell with us and the land will be before you live and trade in it and get possessions in it shechem said to her father and to her brothers let me find favor in your eyes and whatever you will tell me i will give ask me a great amount for a dowry and i will give whatever you ask of me but give me the young lady as a wife the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with deceit and spoke because he had defiled dinah their sister and said to them we cant do this thing to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised for that is a reproach to us only on this condition will we consent to you if you will be as we are that every male of you be circumcised then will we give our daughters to you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people but if you will not listen to us to be circumcised then we will take our sister and we will be gone their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son the young man didnt wait to do this thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was honored above all the house of his father hamor and shechem his son came to the gate of their city and talked with the men of their city saying these men are peaceful with us therefore let them live in the land and trade in it for behold the land is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us to become one people if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised wont their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours only let us give our consent to them and they will dwell with us all who went out of the gate of his city listened to hamor and to shechem his son and every male was circumcised all who went out of the gate of his city it happened on the third day when they were sore that two of jacobs sons simeon and levi dinahs brothers each took his sword came upon the unsuspecting city and killed all the males they killed hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went away jacobs sons came on the dead and plundered the city because they had defiled their sister they took their flocks their herds their donkeys that which was in the city that which was in the field and all their wealth they took captive all their little ones and their wives and took as plunder everything that was in the house jacob said to simeon and levi you have troubled me to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites i am few in number they will gather themselves together against me and strike me and i will be destroyed i and my house they said should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute god said to jacob arise go up to bethel and live there make there an altar to god who appeared to you when you fled from the face of esau your brother then jacob said to his household and to all who were with him put away the foreign gods that are among you purify yourselves change your garments let us arise and go up to bethel i will make there an altar to god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went they gave to jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands and the rings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem they traveled and a terror of god was on the cities that were around them and they didnt pursue the sons of jacob so jacob came to luz that is bethel which is in the land of canaan he and all the people who were with him he built an altar there and called the place el beth el because there god was revealed to him when he fled from the face of his brother deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried below bethel under the oak and its name was called allon bacuth god appeared to jacob again when he came from paddan aram and blessed him god said to him your name is jacob your name shall not be jacob any more but your name will be israel he named him israel god said to him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations will be from you and kings will come out of your body the land which i gave to abraham and isaac i will give it to you and to your seed after you will i give the land god went up from him in the place where he spoke with him jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him a pillar of stone he poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it jacob called the name of the place where god spoke with him bethel they traveled from bethel there was still some distance to come to ephrath and rachel travailed she had hard labor when she was in hard labor the midwife said to her dont be afraid for now you will have another son it happened as her soul was departing for she died that she named him benoni but his father named him benjamin rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem jacob set up a pillar on her grave the same is the pillar of rachels grave to this day israel traveled and spread his tent beyond the tower of eder it happened while israel lived in that

with his brothers he was a boy with the sons of bilhah and zilpah his fathers wives joseph brought an evil report of them to their father now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers and they hated him and couldnt speak peaceably to him joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him all the more he said to them please hear this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and behold my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves came around and bowed down to my sheaf his brothers said to him will you indeed reign over us or will you indeed have dominion over us they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers and said behold i have dreamed yet another dream and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me he told it to his father and to his brothers his father rebuked him and said to him what is this dream that you have dreamed will i and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth his brothers envied him but his father kept this saying in mind his brothers went to feed their fathers flock in shechem israel said to joseph arent your brothers feeding the flock in shechem come and i will send you to them he said to him here i am he said to him go now see whether it is well with your brothers and well with the flock and bring me word again so he sent him out of the valley of hebron and he came to shechem a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field the man asked him what are you looking for he said i am looking for my brothers tell me please where they are feeding the flock the man said they have left here for i heard them say let us go to dothan joseph went after his brothers and found them in dothan they saw him afar off and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him they said one to another behold this dreamer comes come now therefore and lets kill him and cast him into one of the pits and we will say an evil animal has devoured him we will see what will become of his dreams reuben heard it and delivered him out of their hand and said lets not take his life reuben said to them shed no blood throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness but lay no hand on him that he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father it happened when joseph came to his brothers that they stripped joseph of his coat the coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and threw him into the pit the pit was empty there was no water in it they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and saw a caravan of ishmaelites was coming from gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt judah said to his brothers what profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood come and lets sell him to the ishmaelites and not let our hand be on him for he is our brother our flesh his brothers listened to him midianites who were merchants passed by and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver they brought joseph into egypt reuben returned to the pit and saw that joseph wasnt in the pit and he tore his clothes he returned to his brothers and said the child is no more and i where will i go they took josephs coat and killed a male goat and dipped the coat in the blood they took the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said we have found this examine it now whether it is your sons coat or not he recognized it and said it is my sons coat an evil animal has devoured him joseph is without doubt torn in pieces jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his waist and mourned for his son many days all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted he said for i will go down to sheol to my son mourning his father wept for him the midianites sold him into egypt to potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard it happened at that time that judah went down from his brothers and visited a certain adullamite whose name was hirah judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua he took her and went in to her she conceived and bore a son and he named him er she conceived again and bore a son and she named him onan she yet again bore a son and named him shelah and he was at chezib when she bore him judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord the lord killed him judah said to onan go in to your brothers wife and perform the duty of a husbands brother to her and raise up seed to your brother onan knew that the seed wouldnt be his and it happened when he went in to his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest he should give seed to his brother the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the lord and he killed him also then judah said to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow in your fathers house until shelah my son is grown up for he said lest he also die like his brothers tamar went and lived in her fathers house after many days shuas daughter the wife of judah died judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers to timnah he and his friend hirah the adullamite it was told tamar saying behold your father in law is going up to timnah to shear his sheep she took off of her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of enaim which is by the way to timnah for she saw that shelah was grown up and she wasnt given to him as a wife when judah saw her he thought that she was a prostitute for she had covered her face he turned to her by the way and said please come let me come in to you for he didnt know that she was his daughter in law she said what will you give me that you may come in to me he said i will send you a young goat from the flock she said will you give me a pledge until you send it he said what pledge will i give you she said your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand he gave them to her and came in to her and she conceived by him she arose and went away and put off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive the pledge from the womans hand but he didnt find her then he asked the men of her place saying where is the prostitute that was at enaim by the road they said there has been no prostitute here he returned to judah and said i havent found her and also the men of the place said there has been no prostitute here judah said let her keep it lest we be shamed behold i sent this young goat and you havent found her it happened about three months later that it was told judah saying tamar your daughter in law has played the prostitute and moreover behold she is with child by prostitution judah said bring her out and let her be burnt when she was brought out she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are i am with child she also said please discern whose are these the signet and the cords and the staff judah acknowledged them and said she is more righteous than i because i didnt give her to shelah my son he knew her again no more it happened in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb when she travailed one put out a hand and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand saying this came out first it happened as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said why have you made a breach for yourself therefore his name was called perez afterward his brother came out that had the scarlet thread on his hand and his name was called zerah joseph was brought down to egypt potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard an egyptian bought him from the hand of the ishmaelites that had brought him down there the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man he was in the house of his master the egyptian his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did prosper in his hand joseph found favor in his sight he ministered to him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand it happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field he left all that he had in josephs hand he didnt concern himself with anything except for the food which he ate joseph was well built and handsome it happened after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes on joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said to his masters wife behold my master doesnt know what is with me in the house and he has put all that he has into my hand he isnt greater in this house than i neither has he kept back anything from me but you because you are his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god as she spoke to joseph day by day he didnt listen to her to lie by her or to be with her about this time he went into the house to do his work and there were none of the men of the house inside she caught him by his garment saying lie with me he left his garment in her hand and ran outside when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had run outside she called to the men of her house and spoke to them saying behold he has brought in a hebrew to us to mock us he came in to me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice it happened when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and ran outside she laid up his garment by her until his master came home she spoke to him according to these words saying the hebrew servant whom you have brought to us came in to me to mock me and it happened as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and ran outside it happened when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him saying this is what your servant did to me that his wrath was kindled josephs master took him and put him into the prison the place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in custody but the lord was with joseph and showed kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners who were in the prison whatever they did there he was responsible for it the keeper of the prison didnt look after anything that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it prosper it happened after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief baker he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound the captain of the guard assigned them to joseph and he took care of them they stayed in prison many days they both dreamed a dream each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the cupbearer and the baker of the king of egypt who were bound in the prison joseph came in to them in the morning and saw them and saw that they were sad he asked pharaohs officers who were with him in custody in his masters house saying why do you look so sad today they said to him we have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it joseph said to them dont interpretations belong to god please tell it to me the chief cupbearer told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was in front of me and in the vine were three branches it was as though it budded it blossomed and its clusters produced ripe grapes pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand joseph said to him this is its interpretation the three branches are three days within three more days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office you will give pharaohs cup into his hand the way you did when you were his cupbearer but remember me when it will be well with you and please show kindness to me and make mention of me to pharaoh and bring me out of this house for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said to joseph i also was in my dream and behold three baskets of white bread were on my head in the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for pharaoh and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head joseph answered this is its interpretation the three baskets are three days within three more days pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and will hang you on a tree and the birds will eat your flesh from off you it happened the third day which was pharaohs birthday that he made a feast for all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants he restored the chief cupbearer to his position again and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them yet the chief cupbearer didnt remember joseph but forgot him parashat mikke it happened at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river behold there came up out of the river seven cattle sleek and fat and they fed in the marsh grass behold seven other cattle came up after them out of the river ugly and thin and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river the ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle so pharaoh awoke he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven heads of grain came up on one stalk healthy and good behold seven heads of grain thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all of egypts magicians and wise men pharaoh told them his dreams but there was no one who could interpret them to pharaoh then the chief cupbearer spoke to pharaoh saying i remember my faults today pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard me and the chief baker we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream there was with us there a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he interpreted it happened as he interpreted to us so it was he restored me to my office and he hanged him then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon he shaved himself changed his clothing and came in to pharaoh pharaoh said to joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is no one who can interpret it i have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it joseph answered pharaoh saying it isnt in me god will give pharaoh an answer of peace pharaoh spoke to joseph in my dream behold i stood on the brink of the river and behold there came up out of the river seven cattle fat and sleek they fed in the marsh grass and behold seven other cattle came up after them poor and very ugly and thin such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for ugliness the thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle and when they had eaten them up it couldnt be known that they had eaten them but they were still ugly as at the beginning so i awoke i saw in my dream and behold seven heads of grain came up on one stalk full and good and behold seven heads of grain withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain i told it to the magicians but there was no one who could explain it to me joseph said to pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one what god is about to do he has declared to pharaoh the seven good cattle are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years the dream is one the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind they will be seven years of famine that is the thing which i spoke to pharaoh what god is about to do he has shown to pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt there will arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of egypt the famine will consume the land and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows for it will be very grievous the dream was doubled to pharaoh because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypts produce in the seven plenteous years let them gather all the food of these good years that come and lay up grain under the hand of pharaoh for food in the cities and let them keep it the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine which will be in the land of egypt that the land not perish through the famine the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants pharaoh said to his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom is the spirit of god pharaoh said to joseph because god has shown you all of this there is none so discreet and wise as you you shall be over my house and according to your word will all my people be ruled only in the throne i will be greater than you pharaoh said to joseph behold i have set you over all the land of egypt pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on josephs hand and arrayed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had they cried before him bow the knee he set him over all the land of egypt pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt pharaoh called josephs name zaphenath paneah and he gave him asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on as a wife joseph went out over the land of egypt joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was around every city he laid up in the same joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea very much until he stopped counting for it was without number to joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bore to him joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for he said god has made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house the name of the second he called ephraim for god has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction the seven years of plenty that were in the land of egypt came to an end the seven years of famine began to come just as joseph had said there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said to all the egyptians go to joseph what he says to you do the famine was over all the surface of the earth joseph opened all the store houses and sold to the egyptians the famine was severe in the land of egypt all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain because the famine was severe in all the earth now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt and jacob said to his sons why do you look at one another he said behold i have heard that there is grain in egypt go down there and buy for us from there so that we may live and not die josephs ten brothers went down to buy grain from egypt but jacob didnt send benjamin josephs brother with his brothers for he said lest perhaps harm happen to him the sons of israel came to buy among those who came for the famine was in the land of canaan joseph was the governor over the land it was he who sold to all the people of the land josephs brothers came and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them but acted like a stranger to them and spoke roughly with them he said to them where did you come from they said from the land of canaan to buy food joseph recognized his brothers but they didnt recognize him joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them and said to them you are spies you have come to see the nakedness of the land they said to him no my lord but your servants have come to buy food we are all one mans sons we are honest men your servants are not spies he said to them no but you have come to see the nakedness of the land they said we your servants are twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is no more joseph said to them it is like i told you saying you are spies by this you shall be tested by the life of pharaoh you shall not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here send one of you and let him get your brother and you shall be bound that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies he put them all together into custody for three days joseph said to them the third day do this and live for i fear god if you are honest men then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison but you go carry grain for the famine of your houses bring your youngest brother to me so will your words be verified and you wont die they did so they said one to another we are certainly guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he begged us and we wouldnt listen therefore this distress has come upon us reuben answered them saying didnt i tell you saying dont sin against the child and you wouldnt listen therefore also behold his blood is required they didnt know that joseph understood them for there was an interpreter between them he turned himself away from them and wept then he returned to them and spoke to them and took simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes then joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain and to restore each mans money into his sack and to give them food for the way so it was done to them they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place he saw his money behold it was in the mouth of his sack he said to his brothers my money is restored behold it is in my sack their hearts failed them and they turned trembling one to another saying what is this that god has done to us they came to jacob their father to the land of canaan and told him all that had happened to them saying the man the lord of the land spoke roughly with us and took us for spies of the country we said to him we are honest men we are no spies we are twelve brothers sons of our father one is no more and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan the man the lord of the land said to us by this i will know that you are honest men leave one of your brothers with me and take grain for the famine of your houses and go your way bring your youngest brother to me then i will know that you are not spies but that you are honest men so i will deliver your brother to you and you shall trade in the land it happened as they emptied their sacks that behold each mans bundle of money was in his sack when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid jacob their father said to them you have bereaved me of my children joseph is no more simeon is no more and you want to take benjamin away all these things are against me reuben spoke to his father saying kill my two sons if i dont bring him to you entrust him to my care and i will bring him to you again he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he only is left if harm happens to him along the way in which you go then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol the famine was severe in the land it happened when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of egypt their father said to them go again buy us a little more food judah spoke to him saying the man solemnly warned us saying you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you if youll send our brother with us well go down and buy you food but if youll not send him well not go down for the man said to us you shall not see my face unless your brother is with you israel said why did you treat me so badly telling the man that you had another brother they said the man asked directly concerning ourselves and concerning our relatives saying is your father still alive have you another brother we just answered his questions is there any way we could know that he would say bring your brother down judah said to israel his father send the boy with me and well get up and go so that we may live and not die both we and you and also our little ones ill be collateral for him from my hand will you require him if i dont bring him to you and set him before you then let me bear the blame forever for if we hadnt delayed surely we would have returned a second time by now their father israel said to them if it must be so then do this take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags and carry down a present for the man a little balm a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds and take double money in your hand and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks perhaps it was an oversight take your brother also get up and return to the man may god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may release to you your other brother and benjamin if i am bereaved of my children i am bereaved the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and got up went down to egypt and stood before joseph when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house bring the men into the house and butcher an animal and prepare for the men will dine with me at noon the man did as joseph commanded and the man brought the men to josephs house the men were afraid because they were brought to josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time were brought in that he may seek occasion against us attack us and seize us as slaves along with our donkeys they came near to the steward of josephs house and they spoke to him at the door of the house and said oh my lord we indeed came down the first time to buy food when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks and behold each mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight we have brought it back in our hand we have brought down other money in our hand to buy food we dont know who put our money in our sacks he said peace be to you dont be afraid your god and the god of your father has given you treasure in your sacks i received your money he brought simeon out to them the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet he gave their donkeys fodder they prepared the present for josephs coming at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves down to him to the earth he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom you spoke is he yet alive they said your servant our father is well he is still alive they bowed down humbly he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother his mothers son and said is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me he said god be gracious to you my son joseph hurried for his heart yearned over his brother and he sought a place to weep he entered into his room and wept there he washed his face and came out he controlled himself and said serve the meal they served him by himself and them by themselves and the egyptians that ate with him by themselves because the egyptians dont eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination to the egyptians they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marveled one with another he sent portions to them from before him but benjamins portion was five times as much as any of theirs they drank and were merry with him he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put each mans money in his sacks mouth put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest with his grain money he did according to the word that joseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their donkeys when they had gone out of the city and were not yet far off joseph said to his steward up follow after the men when you overtake them ask them why have you rewarded evil for good isnt this that from which my lord drinks and by which he indeed divines you have done evil in so doing he overtook them and he spoke these words to them they said to him why does my lord speak such words as these far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again to you out of the land of canaan how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lords house with whomever of your servants it is found let him die and we also will be my lords bondservants he said now also let it be according to your words he with whom it is found will be my bondservant and you will be blameless then they hurried and each man took his sack down to the ground and each man opened his sack he searched beginning with the eldest and ending at the youngest the cup was found in benjamins sack then they tore their clothes and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city judah and his brothers came to josephs house and he was still there they fell on the ground before him joseph said to them what deed is this that you have done dont you know that such a man as i can indeed divine judah said what will we tell my lord what will we speak or how will we clear ourselves god has found out the iniquity of your servants behold we are my lords bondservants both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found he said far be it from me that i should do so the man in whose hand the cup is found he will be my bondservant but as for you go up in peace to your father parashat vayigash then judah came near to him and said oh my lord please let your servant speak a word in my lords ears and dont let your anger burn against your servant for you are even as pharaoh my lord asked his servants saying have you a father or a brother we said to my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loves him you said to your servants bring him down to me that i may set my eyes on him we said to my lord the boy cant leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die you said to your servants unless your youngest brother comes down with you you will see my face no more it happened when we came up to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord our father said go again buy us a little food we said we cant go down if our youngest brother is with us then we will go down for we may not see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us your servant my father said to us you know that my wife bore me two sons and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i havent seen him since if you take this one also from me and harm happens to him you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol now therefore when i come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us since his life is bound up in the boys life it will happen when he sees that the boy is no more that he will die your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to sheol for your servant became collateral for the boy to my father saying if i dont bring him to you then i will bear the blame to my father forever now therefore please let your servant stay instead of the boy a bondservant to my lord and let the boy go up with his brothers for how will i go up to my father if the boy isnt with me lest i see the evil that will come on my father then joseph couldnt control himself before all those who stood before him and he cried cause everyone to go out from me no one else stood with him while joseph made himself known to his brothers he wept aloud the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard joseph said to his brothers i am joseph does my father still live his brothers couldnt answer him for they were terrified at his presence joseph said to his brothers come near to me please they came near he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt now dont be grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here for god sent me before you to preserve life for these two years the famine has been in the land and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest god sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth and to save you alive by a great deliverance so now it wasnt you who sent me here but god and he has made me a father to pharaoh lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt hurry and go up to my father and tell him this is what your son joseph says god has made me lord of all egypt come down to me dont wait you shall dwell in the land of goshen and you will be near to me you your children your childrens children your flocks your herds and all that you have there i will nourish you for there are yet five years of famine lest you come to poverty you and your household and all that you have behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaks to you you shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that you have seen you shall hurry and bring my father down here he fell on his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept on his neck he kissed all his brothers and wept on them after that his brothers talked with him the report of it was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brothers have come it pleased pharaoh well and his servants pharaoh said to joseph tell your brothers do this load your animals and go travel to the land of canaan take your father and your households and come to me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and you will eat the fat of the land now you are commanded do this take wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come also dont concern yourselves about your belongings for the good of all of the land of egypt is yours the sons of israel did so joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way he gave each one of them changes of clothing but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing he sent the following to his father ten donkeys loaded with the good things of egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way so he sent his brothers away and they departed he said to them see that you dont quarrel on the way they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan to jacob their father they told him saying joseph is still alive and he is ruler over all the land of egypt his heart fainted for he didnt believe them they told him all the words of joseph which he had said to them when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived israel said it is enough joseph my son is still alive i will go and see him before i die israel traveled with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices to the god of his father isaac god spoke to israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob he said here i am he said i am god the god of your father dont be afraid to go down into egypt for there i will make of you a great nation i will go down with you into egypt i will also surely bring you up again joseph will close your eyes jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him they took their livestock and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and he brought all his seed with him into egypt these are the names of the children of israel who came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn the sons of reuben hanoch pallu hezron and carmi the sons of simeon jemuel jamin ohad jachin zohar and shaul the son of a canaanite woman the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari the sons

elon and jahleel these are the sons of leah whom she bore to jacob in paddan aram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty three the sons of gad ziphion haggi shuni ezbon eri arodi and areli the sons of asher imnah ishvah ishvi beriah and serah their sister the sons of beriah heber and malchiel these are the sons of zilpah whom laban gave to leah his daughter and these she bore to jacob even sixteen souls the sons of rachel jacobs wife joseph and benjamin to joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim whom asenath the daughter of

the souls who came with jacob into egypt who were his direct descendants besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were sixty six the sons of joseph who were born to him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob who came into egypt were seventy he sent judah before him to joseph to show the way before him to goshen and they came into the land of goshen joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet israel his father in goshen he presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while israel said to joseph now let me die since i have seen your face that you are still alive joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers house i will go up and speak with pharaoh and will tell him my brothers and my fathers house who were in the land of canaan have come to me these men are shepherds for they have been keepers of livestock and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have it will happen when pharaoh summons you and will say what is your occupation that you shall say your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now both we and our fathers that you may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the egyptians then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said my father and my brothers with their flocks their herds and all that they own have come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to pharaoh pharaoh said to his brothers what is your occupation they said to pharaoh your servants are shepherds both we and our fathers they said to pharaoh we have come to live as foreigners in the land for there is no pasture for your servants flocks for the famine is severe in the land of canaan now therefore please let your servants dwell in the land of goshen pharaoh spoke to joseph saying your father and your brothers have come to you the land of egypt is before you make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land let them dwell in the land of goshen if you know any able men among them then put them in charge of my livestock joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh pharaoh said to jacob how many are the days of the years of your life jacob said to pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh joseph placed his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded joseph nourished his father his brothers and all of his fathers household with bread according to their families there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very severe so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the grain which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came to joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in your presence for our money fails joseph said give me your livestock and i will give you food for your livestock if your money is gone they brought their livestock to joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks and for the herds and for the donkeys and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year when that year was ended they came to him the second year and said to him we will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent and the herds of livestock are my lords there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands why should we die before your eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants to pharaoh give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land wont be desolate so joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for every man of the egyptians sold his field because the famine was severe on them and the land became pharaohs as for the people he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end of it only he didnt buy the land of the priests for the priests had a portion from pharaoh and ate their portion which pharaoh gave them that is why they didnt sell their land then joseph said to the people behold i have bought you and your land today for pharaoh behold here is seed for you and you shall sow the land it will happen at the harvests that you shall give a fifth to pharaoh and four parts will be your own for seed of the field for your food for them of your households and for food for your little ones they said you have saved our lives let us find favor in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants joseph made it a statute concerning the land of egypt to this day that pharaoh should have the fifth only the land of the priests alone didnt become pharaohs parashat vay i israel lived in the land of egypt in the land of goshen and they got themselves possessions therein and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the days of jacob the years of his life were one hundred forty seven years the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said to him if now i have found favor in your sight please put your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me please dont bury me in egypt but when i sleep with my fathers you shall carry me out of egypt and bury me in their burying place he said i will do as you have said he said swear to me and he swore to him israel bowed himself on the beds head it happened after these things that someone said to joseph behold your father is sick he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim someone told jacob and said behold your son joseph comes to you and israel strengthened himself and sat on the bed jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me and said to me behold i will make you fruitful and multiply you and i will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession now your two sons who were born to you in the land of egypt before i came to you into egypt are mine ephraim and manasseh even as reuben and simeon will be mine your issue whom you become the father of after them will be yours they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance as for me when i came from paddan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when there was still some distance to come to ephrath and i buried her there in the way to ephrath the same is bethlehem israel saw josephs sons and said who are these joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god has given me here he said please bring them to me and i will bless them now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he couldnt see he brought them near to him and he kissed them and embraced them israel said to joseph i didnt think i would see your face and behold god has let me see your seed also joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near to him israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand on manassehs head guiding his hands knowingly for manasseh was the firstborn he blessed joseph and said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has fed me all my life long to this day the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of ephraim it displeased him he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head to manassehs head joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put your right hand on his head his father refused and said i know my son i know he also will become a people and he also will be great however his younger brother will be greater than he and his seed will become a multitude of nations he blessed them that day saying in you will israel bless saying god make you as ephraim and as manasseh he set ephraim before manasseh israel said to joseph behold i am dying but god will be with you and bring you again to the land of your fathers moreover i have given to you one portion above your brothers which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow jacob called to his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come assemble yourselves and hear you sons of jacob listen to israel your father reuben you are my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength excelling in dignity and excelling in power boiling over as water you shall not excel because you went up to your fathers bed then defiled it he went up to my couch simeon and levi are brothers their swords are weapons of violence my soul dont come into their council my glory dont be united to their assembly for in their anger they killed men in their self will they hamstrung cattle cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel judah your brothers will praise you your hand will be on the neck of your enemies your fathers sons will bow down before you judah is a lions cub from the prey my son you have gone up he stooped down he crouched as a lion as a lioness who will rouse him up the scepter will not depart from judah nor the rulers staff from between his feet until he comes to whom it belongs to him will the obedience of the peoples be binding his foal to the vine his donkeys colt to the choice vine he has washed his garments in wine his robes in the blood of grapes his eyes will be red with wine his teeth white with milk zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea he will be for a haven of ships his border will be on sidon issachar is a strong donkey lying down between the saddlebags he saw a resting place that it was good the land that it was pleasant he bows his shoulder to the burden and becomes a servant doing forced labor dan will judge his people as one of the tribes of israel dan will be a serpent in the way an adder in the path that bites the horses heels so that his rider falls backward i have waited for your salvation the lord a troop will press on gad but he will press on their heel ashers food will be rich he will yield royal dainties naphtali is a doe set free who bears beautiful fawns joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful vine by a spring his branches run over the wall the archers have severely grieved him shot at him and persecute him but his bow remained strong the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty one of jacob from there is the shepherd the stone of israel even by the god of your father who will help you by the almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lies below blessings of the breasts and of the womb the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors above the boundaries of the ancient hills they will be on the head of joseph on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning he will devour the prey at evening he will divide the spoil all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them he blessed everyone according to his blessing he instructed them and said to them i am to be gathered to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field from ephron the hittite as a burial place there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah the field and the cave that is therein which was purchased from the children of heth when jacob made an end of charging his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the spirit and was gathered to his people joseph fell on his fathers face wept on him and kissed him joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel forty days were fulfilled for him for that is how many the days it takes to embalm the egyptians wept for him for seventy days when the days of weeping for him were past joseph spoke to the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found favor in your eyes please speak in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying behold i am dying bury me in my grave which i have dug for myself in the land of canaan now therefore please let me go up and bury my father and i will come again pharaoh said go up and bury your father just like he made you swear joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house all the elders of the land of egypt all the house of joseph his brothers and his fathers house only their little ones their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen there went up with him both chariots and horsemen it was a very great company they came to the threshing floor of atad which is beyond the jordan and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation he mourned for his father seven days when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning by the egyptians therefore its name was called abel mizraim which is beyond the jordan his sons did to him just as he commanded them for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial site from ephron the hittite before mamre joseph returned into egypt he and his brothers and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father when josephs brothers saw that their father was dead they said it may be that joseph will hate us and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him they sent a message to joseph saying your father commanded before he died saying you shall tell joseph now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers and their sin because they did evil to you now please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the god of your father joseph wept when they spoke to him his brothers also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we are your servants joseph said to them dont be afraid for am i in the place of god as for you you meant evil against me but god meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save many people alive now therefore dont be afraid i will nourish you and your little ones he comforted them and spoke kindly to them joseph lived in egypt he and his fathers house joseph lived one hundred ten years joseph saw ephraims children to the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born on josephs knees joseph said to his brothers i am dying but god will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to abraham to isaac and to jacob joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and you shall carry up my bones from here so joseph died being one hundred ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt notes the hebrew word rendered god is elohim after god the hebrew has the two letters aleph tav the first and last letters of the hebrew alphabet as a grammatical marker the lord is gods proper name sometimes rendered lord all caps in other translations adam and man are spelled with the exact same consonants in hebrew so this can be correctly translated either way or offspring the word translated lord is adonai beer lahai roi means well of the one who lives and sees me isaac means he laughs zoar means little isaac means he laughs beersheba can mean well of the oath or well of seven or the lord jireh or the lord seeing or offspring shibah means oath or seven beersheba means well of the oath or well of the seven joseph means may he add teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property jegar sahadutha means witness heap in aramaic galeed means witness heap in hebrew peniel means face of god succoth means shelters or booths el elohe israel means god the god of israel or the god of israel is mighty hebrew has literally daughter benoni means son of my trouble benjamin means son of my right hand sheol is the place of the dead perez means breaking out zerah means scarlet or brightness manasseh sounds like the hebrew for forget ephraim sounds like the hebrew for twice fruitful sheol is the place of the dead sheol is the place of the dead sheol is the place of the dead isaac asimov i robot introduction i looked at my notes and i didnt like them id spent three days at u s robots and might as well have spent them at home with the encyclopedia tellurica susan calvin had been born in the year they said which made her seventy five now everyone knew that appropriately enough u s robot and mechanical men inc was seventy five also since it had been in the year of dr calvins birth that lawrence robertson had first taken out incorporation papers for what eventually became the strangest industrial giant in mans history well everyone knew that too at the age of twenty susan calvin had been part of the particular psycho math seminar at which dr alfred lanning of u s robots had demonstrated the first mobile robot to be equipped with a voice it was a large clumsy unbeautiful robot smelling of machine oil and destined for the projected mines on mercury but it could speak and make sense susan said nothing at that seminar took no part in the hectic discussion period that followed she was a frosty girl plain and colorless who protected herself against a world she disliked by a masklike expression and a hypertrophy of intellect but as she watched and listened she felt the stirrings of a cold enthusiasm she obtained her bachelors degree at columbia in and began graduate work in cybernetics all that had been done in the mid twentieth century on calculating machines had been upset by robertson and his positronic brain paths the miles of relays and photocells had given way to the spongy globe of plantinumiridium about the size of a human brain she learned to calculate the parameters necessary to fix the possible variables within the positronic brain to construct brains on paper such that the responses to given stimuli could be accurately predicted in she obtained her ph d and joined united states robots as a robopsychologist becoming the first great practitioner of a new science lawrence robertson was still president of the corporation alfred lanning had become director of research for fifty years she watched the direction of human progress change and leap ahead now she was retiring as much as she ever could at least she was allowing someone elses name to be inset upon the door of her office that essentially was what i had i had a long list of her published papers of the patents in her name i had the chronological details of her promotions in short i had her professional vita in full detail but that wasnt what i wanted i needed more than that for my feature articles for interplanetary press much more i told her so dr calvin i said as lushly as possible in the mind of the public you and u s robots are identical your retirement will end an era and you want the human interest angle she didnt smile at me i dont think she ever smiles but her eyes were sharp though not angry i felt her glance slide through me and out my occiput and knew that i was uncommonly transparent to her that everybody was but i said thats right human interest out of robots a contradiction no doctor out of you well ive been called a robot myself surely theyve told you im not human they had but there was no point in saying so she got up from her chair she wasnt tall and she looked frail i followed her to the window and we looked out the offices and factories of u s robots were a small city spaced and planned it was flattened out like an aerial photograph when i first came here she said i had a little room in a building right about there where the fire house is now she pointed it was torn down before you were born i shared the room with three others i had half a desk we built our robots all in one building output three a week now look at us fifty years i hackneyed is a long time not when youre looking back at them she said you wonder how they vanished so quickly she went back to her desk and sat down she didnt need expression on her face to look sad somehow how old are you she wanted to know thirty two i said then you dont remember a world without robots there was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend now he has creatures to help him stronger creatures than himself more faithful more useful and absolutely devoted to him mankind is no longer alone have you ever thought of it that way im afraid i havent may i quote you you may to you a robot is a robot gears and metal electricity and positrons mind and iron human made it necessary human destroyed but you havent worked with them so you dont know them theyre a cleaner better breed than we are i tried to nudge her gently with words wed like to hear some of the things you could tell us get your views on robots the interplanetary press reaches the entire solar system potential audience is three billion dr calvin they ought to know what you could tell them on robots it wasnt necessary to nudge she didnt hear me but she was moving in the right direction they might have known that from the start we sold robots for earth use then before my time it was even of course that was when robots could not talk afterward they became more human and opposition began the labor unions of course naturally opposed robot competition for human jobs and various segments of religious opinion had their superstitious objections it was all quite ridiculous and quite useless and yet there it was i was taking it down verbatim on my pocket recorder trying not to show the knuckle motions of my hand if you practice a bit you can get to the point where you can record accurately without taking the little gadget out of your pocket take the case of robbie she said i never knew him he was dismantled the year before i joined the company hopelessly out of date but i saw the little girl in the museum she stopped but i didnt say anything i let her eyes mist up and her mind travel back she had lots of time to cover i heard about it later and when they called us blasphemers and demon creators i always thought of him robbie was a non vocal robot he couldnt speak he was made and sold in those were the days before extreme specialization so he was sold as a nursemaid as a what as a nursemaid robbie ninety eight ninety nine one hundred gloria withdrew her chubby little forearm from before her eyes and stood for a moment wrinkling her nose and blinking in the sunlight then trying to watch in all directions at once she withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against which she had been leaning she craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the right and then withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark recesses the quiet was profound except for the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird braving the midday sun gloria pouted i bet he went inside the house and ive told him a million times that thats not fair with tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her forehead she moved determinedly toward the two story building up past the driveway too late she heard the rustling sound behind her followed by the distinctive and rhythmic clump clump of robbies metal feet she whirled about to see her triumphing companion emerge from hiding and make for the home tree at full speed gloria shrieked in dismay wait robbie that wasnt fair robbie you promised you wouldnt run until i found you her little feet could make no headway at all against robbies giant strides then within ten feet of the goal robbies pace slowed suddenly to the merest of crawls and gloria with one final burst of wild speed dashed pantingly past him to touch the welcome bark of home tree first gleefully she turned on the faithful robbie and with the basest of ingratitude rewarded him for his sacrifice by taunting him cruelly for a lack of running ability robbie cant run she shouted at the top of her eight year old voice i can beat him any day i can beat him any day she chanted the words in a shrill rhythm robbie didnt answer of course not in words he pantomimed running instead inching away until gloria found herself running after him as he dodged her narrowly forcing her to veer in helpless circles little arms outstretched and fanning at the air robbie she squealed stand still and the laughter was forced out of her in breathless jerks until he turned suddenly and caught her up whirling her round so that for her the world fell away for a moment with a blue emptiness beneath and green trees stretching hungrily downward toward the void then she was down in the grass again leaning against robbies leg and still holding a hard metal finger after a while her breath returned she pushed uselessly at her disheveled hair in vague imitation of one of her mothers gestures and twisted to see if her dress were torn she slapped her hand against robbies torso bad boy ill spank you and robbie cowered holding his hands over his face so that she had to add no i wont robbie i wont spank you but anyway its my turn to hide how because youve got longer legs and you promised not to run till i found you robbie nodded his head a small parallelepiped with rounded edges and corners attached to a similar but much larger parallelepiped that served as torso by means of a short flexible stalk and obediently faced the tree a thin metal film descended over his glowing eyes and from within his body came a steady resonant ticking dont peek now and dont skip any numbers warned gloria and scurried for cover with unvarying regularity seconds were ticked off and at the hundredth up went the eyelids and the glowing red of robbies eyes swept the prospect they rested for a moment on a bit of colorful gingham that protruded from behind a boulder he advanced a few steps and convinced himself that it was gloria who squatted behind it slowly remaining always between gloria and home tree he advanced on the hiding place and when gloria was plainly in sight and could no longer even theorize to herself that she was not seen he extended one arm toward her slapping the other against his leg so that it rang again gloria emerged sulkily you peeked she exclaimed with gross unfairness besides im tired of playing hide and seek i want a ride but robbie was hurt at the unjust accusation so he seated himself carefully and shook his head ponderously from side to side gloria changed her tone to one of gentle coaxing immediately come on robbie i didnt mean it about the peeking give me a ride robbie was not to be won over so easily though he gazed stubbornly at the sky and shook his head even more emphatically please robbie please give me a ride she encircled his neck with rosy arms and hugged tightly then changing moods in a moment she moved away if you dont im going to cry and her face twisted appallingly in preparation hard hearted robbie paid scant attention to this dreadful possibility and shook his head a third time gloria found it necessary to play her trump card if you dont she exclaimed warmly i wont tell you any more stories thats all not one robbie gave in immediately and unconditionally before this ultimatum nodding his head vigorously until the metal of his neck hummed carefully he raised the little girl and placed her on his broad fiat shoulders glorias threatened tears vanished immediately and she crowed with delight robbies metal skin kept at a constant temperature of seventy by the high resistance coils within felt nice and comfortable while the beautifully loud sound her heels made as they bumped rhythmically against his chest was enchanting youre an air coaster robbie youre a big silver aircoaster hold out your arms straight you got to robbie if youre going to be an aircoaster the logic was irrefutable robbies arms were wings catching the air currents and he was a silver coaster gloria twisted the robots head and leaned to the right he banked sharply gloria equipped the coaster with a motor that went br r r and then with weapons that went powie and sh sh shshsh pirates were giving chase and the ships blasters were coming into play the pirates dropped in a steady rain got another one two more she cried then faster men gloria said pompously were running out of ammunition she aimed over her shoulder with undaunted courage and robbie was a blunt nosed spaceship zooming through the void at maximum acceleration clear across the field he sped to the patch of tall grass on the other side where he stopped with a suddenness that evoked a shriek from his flushed rider and then tumbled her onto the soft green carpet gloria gasped and panted and gave voice to intermittent whispered exclamations of that was nice robbie waited until she had caught her breath and then pulled gently at a lock of hair you want something said gloria eyes wide in an apparently artless complexity that fooled her huge nursemaid not at all he pulled the curl harder oh i know you want a story robbie nodded rapidly which one robbie made a semi circle in the air with one finger the little girl protested again ive told you cinderella a million times arent you tired of it its for babies another semi circle oh well gloria composed herself ran over the details of the tale in her mind together with her own elaborations of which she had several and began are you ready well once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl whose name was ella and she had a terribly cruel step mother and two very ugly and very cruel step sisters and gloria was reaching the very climax of the tale midnight was striking and everything was changing back to the shabby originals lickety split while robbie listened tensely with burning eyes when the interruption came gloria it was the high pitched sound of a woman who has been calling not once but several times and had the nervous tone of one in whom anxiety was beginning to overcome impatience mammas calling me said gloria not quite happily youd better carry me back to the house robbie robbie obeyed with alacrity for somehow there was that in him which judged it best to obey mrs weston without as much as a scrap of hesitation glorias father was rarely home in the daytime except on sunday today for instance and when he was he proved a genial and understanding person glorias mother however was a source of uneasiness to robbie and there was always the impulse to sneak away from her sight mrs weston caught sight of them the minute they rose above the masking tufts of long grass and retired inside the house to wait ive shouted myself hoarse gloria she said severely where were you i was with robbie quavered gloria i was telling him cinderella and i forgot it was dinner time well its a pity robbie forgot too then as if that reminded her of the robots presence she whirled upon him you may go robbie she doesnt need you now then brutally and dont come back till i call you robbie turned to go but hesitated as gloria cried out in his defense wait mamma you got to let him stay i didnt finish cinderella for him i said i would tell him cinderella and im not finished gloria honest and truly mamma hell stay so quiet you wont even know hes here he can sit on the chair in the corner and he wont say a word i mean he wont do anything will you robbie robbie appealed to nodded his massive head up and down once gloria if you dont stop this at once you shant see robbie for a whole week the girls eyes fell all right but cinderella is his favorite story and i didnt finish it and he likes it so much the robot left with a disconsolate step and gloria choked back a sob george weston was comfortable it was a habit of his to be comfortable on sunday afternoons a good hearty dinner below the hatches a nice soft dilapidated couch on which to sprawl a copy of the times slippered feet and shirtless chest how could anyone help but be comfortable he wasnt pleased therefore when his wife walked in after ten years of married life be still was so unutterably foolish as to love her and there was no question that he was always glad to see her still sunday afternoons just after dinner were sacred to him and his idea of solid comfort was to be left in utter solitude for two or three hours consequently he fixed his eye firmly upon the latest reports of the lefebre yoshida expedition to mars this one was to take off from lunar base and might actually succeed and pretended she wasnt there mrs weston waited patiently for two minutes then impatiently for two more and finally broke the silence george hmpph george i say will you put down that paper and look at me the paper rustled to the floor and weston turned a weary face toward his wife what is it dear you know what it is george its gloria and that terrible machine what terrible machine now dont pretend you dont know what im talking about its that robot gloria calls robbie he doesnt leave her for a moment well why should he hes not supposed to and he certainly isnt a terrible machine hes the best darn robot money can buy and im damned sure he set me back half a years income hes worth it though darn sight cleverer than half my office staff he made a move to pick up the paper again but his wife was quicker and snatched it away you listen to me george i wont have my daughter entrusted to a machine and i dont care how clever it is it has no soul and no one knows what it may be thinking a child just isnt made to be guarded by a thing of metal weston frowned when did you decide this hes been with gloria two years now and i havent seen you worry till now it was different at first it was a novelty it took a load off me and and it was a fashionable thing to do but now i dont know the neighbors well what have the neighbors to do with it now look a robot is infinitely more to be trusted than a human nursemaid robbie was constructed for only one purpose really to be the companion of a little child his entire mentality has been created for the purpose he just cant help being faithful and loving and kind hes a machine made so thats more than you can say for humans but something might go wrong some some mrs weston was a bit hazy about the insides of a robot some little jigger will come loose and the awful thing will go berserk and and she couldnt bring herself to complete the quite obvious thought nonsense weston denied with an involuntary nervous shiver thats completely ridiculous we had a long discussion at the time we bought robbie about the first law of robotics you know that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human being that long before enough can go wrong to alter that first law a robot would be completely inoperable its a mathematical impossibility besides i have an engineer from u s robots here twice a year to give the poor gadget a complete overhaul why theres no more chance of any thing at all going wrong with robbie than there is of you or i suddenly going looney considerably less in fact besides how are you going to take him away from gloria he made another futile stab at the paper and his wife tossed it angrily into the next room thats just it george she wont play with anyone else there are dozens of little boys and girls that she should make friends with but she wont she wont go near them unless i make her thats no way for a little girl to grow up you want her to be normal dont you you want her to be able to take her part in society youre jumping at shadows grace pretend robbies a dog ive seen hundreds of children who would rather have their dog than their father a dog is different george we must get rid of that horrible thing you can sell it back to the company ive asked and you can youve asked now look here grace lets not go off the deep end were keeping the robot until gloria is older and i dont want the subject brought up again and with that he walked out of the room in a huff mrs weston met her husband at the door two evenings later youll have to listen to this george theres bad feeling in the village about what asked weston he stepped into the washroom and drowned out any possible answer by the splash of water mrs weston waited she said about robbie weston stepped out towel in hand face red and angry what are you talking about oh its been building up and building up ive tried to close my eyes to it but im not going to any more most of the villagers consider robbie dangerous children arent allowed to go near our place in the evenings we trust our child with the thing well people arent reasonable about these things then to hell with them saying that doesnt solve the problem ive got to do my shopping down there ive got to meet them every day and its even worse in the city these days when it comes to robots new york has just passed an ordinance keeping all robots off the streets between sunset and sunrise all right but they cant stop us from keeping a robot in our home grace this is one of your campaigns i recognize it but its no use the answer is still no were keeping robbie and yet he loved his wife and what was worse his wife knew it george weston after all was only a man poor thing and his wife made full use of every device which a clumsier and more scrupulous sex has learned with reason and futility to fear ten times in the ensuing week he cried robbie stays and thats final and each time it was weaker and accompanied by a louder and more agonized groan came the day at last when weston approached his daughter guiltily and suggested a beautiful visivox show in the village gloria clapped her hands happily can robbie go no dear he said and winced at the sound of his voice they wont allow robots at the visivox but you can tell him all about it when you get home he stumbled all over the last few words and looked away gloria came back from town bubbling over with enthusiasm for the visivox had been a gorgeous spectacle indeed she waited for her father to maneuver the jet car into the sunken garage wait till i tell robbie daddy he would have liked it like anything especially when francis fran was backing away so o o quietly and backed right into one of the leopard men and had to run she laughed again daddy are there really leopard men on the moon probably not said weston absently its just funny make believe he couldnt take much longer with the car hed have to face it gloria ran across the lawn robbie robbie then she stopped suddenly at the sight of a beautiful collie which regarded her out of serious brown eyes as it wagged its tail on the porch oh what a nice dog gloria climbed the steps approached cautiously and patted it is it for me daddy her mother had joined them yes it is gloria isnt it nice soft and furry its very gentle it likes little girls can he play games surely he can do any number of tricks would you like to see some right away i want robbie to see him too robbie she stopped uncertainly and frowned ill bet hes just staying in his room because hes mad at me for not taking him to the visivox youll have to explain to him daddy he might not believe me but he knows if you say it its so westons lip grew tighter he looked toward his wife but could not catch her eye gloria turned precipitously and ran down the basement steps shouting as she went robbie come and see what daddy and mamma brought me they brought me a dog robbie in a minute she had returned a frightened little girl mamma robbie isnt in his room where is he there was no answer and george weston coughed and was suddenly extremely interested in an aimlessly drifting cloud glorias voice quavered on the verge of tears wheres robbie mamma mrs weston sat down and drew her daughter gently to her dont feel bad gloria robbie has gone away i think gone away where wheres he gone away mamma no one knows darling he just walked away weve looked and weve looked and weve looked for him but we cant find him you mean hell never come back again her eyes were round with horror we may find him soon well keep looking for him and meanwhile you can play with your nice new doggie look at him his name is lightning and he can but glorias eyelids had overflown i dont want the nasty dog i want robbie i want you to find me robbie her feelings became too deep for words and she spluttered into a shrill wail mrs weston glanced at her husband for help but he merely shuffled his feet morosely and did not withdraw his ardent stare from the heavens so she bent to the task of consolation why do you cry gloria robbie was only a machine just a nasty old machine he wasnt alive at all he was not no machine screamed gloria fiercely and ungrammatically he was a person just like you and me and he was my friend i want him back oh mamma i want him back her mother groaned in defeat and left gloria to her sorrow let her have her cry out she told her husband childish griefs are never lasting in a few days shell forget that awful robot ever existed but time proved mrs weston a bit too optimistic to be sure gloria ceased crying but she ceased smiling too and the passing days found her ever more silent and shadowy gradually her attitude of passive unhappiness wore mrs weston down and all that kept her from yielding was the impossibility of admitting defeat to her husband then one evening she flounced into the living room sat down folded her arms and looked boiling mad her husband stretched his neck in order to see her over his newspaper what now grace its that child george ive had to send back the dog today gloria positively couldnt stand the sight of him she said shes driving me into a nervous breakdown weston laid down the paper and a hopeful gleam entered his eye maybe maybe we ought to get robbie back it might be done you know i can get in touch with no she replied grimly i wont hear of it were not giving up that easily my child shall not be brought up by a robot if it takes years to break her of it weston picked up his paper again with a disappointed air a year of this will have me prematurely gray youre a big help george was the frigid answer what gloria needs is a change of environment of course she cant forget robbie here how can she when every tree and rock reminds her of him it is really the silliest situation i have ever heard of imagine a child pining away for the loss of a robot well stick to the point whats the change in environment youre planning were going to take her to new york the city in august say do you know what new york is like in august its unbearable millions do bear it they dont have a place like this to go to if they didnt have to stay in new york they wouldnt well we have to i say were leaving now or as soon as we can make the arrangements in the city gloria will find sufficient interests and sufficient friends to perk her up and make her forget that machine oh lord groaned the lesser half those frying pavements we have to was the unshaken response gloria has lost five pounds in the last month and my little girls health is more important to me than your comfort its a pity you didnt think of your little girls health before you deprived her of her pet robot he muttered but to himself gloria displayed immediate signs of improvement when told of the impending trip to the city she spoke little of it but when she did it was always with lively anticipation again she began to smile and to eat with something of her former appetite mrs weston hugged herself for joy and lost no opportunity to triumph over her still skeptical husband you see george she helps with the packing like a little angel and chatters away as if she hadnt a care in the world its just as i told you all we need do is substitute other interests hmpph was the skeptical response i hope so preliminaries were gone through quickly arrangements were made for the preparation of their city home and a couple were engaged as housekeepers for the country home when the day of the trip finally did come gloria was all but her old self again and no mention of robbie passed her lips at all in high good humor the family took a taxi gyro to the airport weston would have preferred using his own private gyro but it was only a two seater with no room for baggage and entered the waiting liner come gloria called mrs weston ive saved you a seat near the window so you can watch the scenery gloria trotted down the aisle cheerily flattened her nose into a white oval against the thick clear glass and watched with an intentness that increased as the sudden coughing of the motor drifted backward into the interior she was too young to be frightened when the ground dropped away as if let through a trap door and she herself suddenly became twice her usual weight but not too young to be mightily interested it wasnt until the ground had changed into a tiny patch work quilt that she withdrew her nose and faced her mother again will we soon be in the city mamma she asked rubbing her chilled nose and watching with interest as the patch of moisture which her breath had formed on the pane shrank slowly and vanished in about half an hour dear then with just the faintest trace of anxiety arent you glad were going dont you think youll be very happy in the city with all the buildings and people and things to see well go to the visivox every day and see shows and go to the circus and the beach and yes mamma was glorias unenthusiastic rejoinder the liner passed over a bank of clouds at the moment and gloria was instantly absorbed in the usual spectacle of clouds underneath one then they were over clear sky again and she turned to her mother with a sudden mysterious air of secret knowledge i know why were going to the city mamma do you mrs weston was puzzled why dear you didnt tell me because you wanted it to be a surprise but i know for a moment she was lost in admiration at her own acute penetration and then she laughed gaily were going to new york so we can find robbie arent we with detectives the statement caught george weston in the middle of a drink of water with disastrous results there was a sort of strangled gasp a geyser of water and then a bout of choking coughs when all was over he stood there a red faced water drenched and very very annoyed person mrs weston maintained her composure but when gloria repeated her question in a more anxious tone of voice she found her temper rather bent maybe she retorted tartly now sit and be still for heavens sake new york city a d was a paradise for the sightseer more than ever in its history glorias parents realized this and made the most of it on direct orders from his wife george weston arranged to have his business take care of itself for a month or so in order to be free to spend the time in what he termed dissipating gloria to the verge of ruin like everything else weston did this was gone about in an efficient thorough and business like way before the month had passed nothing that could be done had not been done she was taken to the top of the half mile tall roosevelt building to gaze down in awe upon the jagged panorama of rooftops that blended far off in the fields of long island and the flatlands of new jersey they visited the zoos where gloria stared in delicious fright at the real live lion rather disappointed that the keepers fed him raw steaks instead of human beings as she had expected and asked insistently and peremptorily to see the whale the various museums came in for their share of attention together with the parks and the beaches and the aquarium she was taken halfway up the hudson in an excursion steamer fitted out in the archaism of the mad twenties she travelled into the stratosphere on an exhibition trip where the sky turned deep purple and the stars came out and the misty earth below looked like a huge concave bowl down under the waters of the long island sound she was taken in a glass walled sub sea vessel where in a green and wavering world quaint and curious sea things ogled her and wiggled suddenly away on a more prosaic level mrs weston took her to the department stores where she could revel in another type of fairyland in fact when the month had nearly sped the westons were convinced that everything conceivable had been done to take glorias mind once and for all off the departed robbie but they were not quite sure they had succeeded the fact remained that wherever gloria went she displayed the most absorbed and concentrated interest in such robots as happened to be present no matter how exciting the spectacle before her nor how novel to her girlish eyes she turned away instantly if the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of metallic movement mrs weston went out of her way to keep gloria away from all robots and the matter was finally climaxed in the episode at the museum of science and industry the museum had announced a special childrens program in which exhibits of scientific witchery scaled down to the child mind were to be shown the westons of course placed it upon their list of absolutely it was while the westons were standing totally absorbed in the exploits of a powerful electro magnet that mrs weston suddenly became aware of the fact that gloria was no longer with her initial panic gave way to calm decision and enlisting the aid of three attendants a careful search was begun gloria of course was not one to wander aimlessly however for her age she was an unusually determined and purposeful girl quite full of the maternal genes in that respect she had seen a huge sign on the third floor which had said this way to the talking robot having spelled it out to herself and having noticed that her parents did not seem to wish to move in the proper direction she did the obvious thing waiting for an opportune moment of parental distraction she calmly disengaged herself and followed the sign the talking robot was a tour de force a thoroughly impractical device possessing publicity value only once an hour an escorted group stood before it and asked questions of the robot engineer in charge in careful whispers those the engineer decided were suitable for the robots circuits were transmitted to the talking robot it was rather dull it may be nice to know that the square of fourteen is one hundred ninety six that the temperature at the moment is degrees fahrenheit and the air pressure inches of mercury that the atomic weight of sodium is but one doesnt really need a robot for that one especially does not need an unwieldy totally immobile mass of wires and coils spreading over twenty five square yards few people bothered to return for a second helping but one girl in her middle teens sat quietly on a bench waiting for a third she was the only one in the room when gloria entered gloria did not look at her to her at the moment another human being was but an inconsiderable item she saved her attention for this large thing with the wheels for a moment she hesitated in dismay it didnt look like any robot she had ever seen cautiously and doubtfully she raised her treble voice please mr robot sir are you the talking robot sir she wasnt sure but it seemed to her that a robot that actually talked was worth a great deal of politeness the girl in her mid teens allowed a look of intense concentration to cross her thin plain face she whipped out a small notebook and began writing in rapid pot hooks there was an oily whir of gears and a mechanically timbred voice boomed out in words that lacked accent and intonation i am the robot that talks gloria stared at it ruefully it did talk but the sound came from inside somewheres there was no face to talk to she said can you help me mr robot sir the talking robot was designed to answer questions and only such questions as it could answer had ever been put to it it was quite confident of its ability therefore i can help you thank you mr robot sir have you seen robbie who is robbie hes a robot mr robot sir she stretched to tip toes hes about so high mr robot sir only higher and hes very nice hes got a head you know i mean you havent but he has mr robot sir the talking robot had been left behind a robot yes mr robot sir a robot just like you except he cant talk of course and looks like a real person a robot like me yes mr robot sir to which the talking robots only response was an erratic splutter and an occasional incoherent sound the radical generalization offered it i e its existence not as a particular object but as a member of a general group was too much for it loyally it tried to encompass the concept and half a dozen coils burnt out little warning signals were buzzing the girl in her mid teens left at that point she had enough for her physics paper on practical aspects of robotics this paper was susan calvins first of many on the subject gloria stood waiting with carefully concealed impatience for the machines answer when she heard the cry behind her of there she is and recognized that cry as her mothers what are you doing here you bad girl cried mrs weston anxiety dissolving at once into anger do you know you frightened your mamma and daddy almost to death why did you run away the robot engineer had also dashed in tearing his hair and demanding who of the gathering crowd had tampered with the machine cant anybody read signs he yelled youre not allowed in here without an attendant gloria raised her grieved voice over the din i only came to see the talking robot mamma i thought he might know where robbie was because theyre both robots and then as the thought of robbie was suddenly brought forcefully home to her she burst into a sudden storm of tears and i got to find robbie mamma i got to mrs weston strangled a cry and said oh good heavens come home george this is more than i can stand that evening george weston left for several hours and the next morning he approached his wife with something that looked suspiciously like smug complacence ive got an idea grace about what was the gloomy uninterested query about gloria youre not going to suggest buying back that robot no of course not then go ahead i might as well listen to you nothing ive done seems to have done any good all right heres what ive been thinking the whole trouble with gloria is that she thinks of robbie as a person and not as a machine naturally she cant forget him now if we managed to convince her that robbie was nothing more than a mess of steel and copper in the form of sheets and wires with electricity its juice of life how long would her longings last its the psychological attack if you see my point how do you plan to do it simple where do you suppose i went last night i persuaded robertson of u s robots and mechanical men inc to arrange for a complete tour of his premises tomorrow the three of us will go and by the time were through gloria will have it drilled into her that a robot is not alive mrs westons eyes widened gradually and something glinted in her eyes that was quite like sudden admiration why george thats a good idea and george westons vest buttons strained only kind i have he said mr struthers was a conscientious general manager and naturally inclined to be a bit talkative the combination therefore resulted in a tour that was fully explained perhaps even over abundantly explained at every step however mrs weston was not bored indeed she stopped him several times and begged him to repeat his statements in simpler language so that gloria might understand under the influence of this appreciation of his narrative powers mr struthers expanded genially and became ever more communicative if possible george weston himself showed a gathering impatience pardon me struthers he said breaking into the middle of a lecture on the photo electric cell havent you a section of the factory where only robot labor is employed eh oh yes yes indeed he smiled at mrs weston a vicious circle in a way robots creating more robots of course we are not making a general practice out of it for one thing the unions would never let us but we can turn out a very few robots using robot labor exclusively merely as a sort of scientific experiment you see he tapped his pince nez into one palm argumentatively what the labor unions dont realize and i say this as a man who has always been very sympathetic with the labor movement in general is that the advent of the robot while involving some dislocation to begin with will inevitably yes struthers said weston but about that section of the factory you speak of may we see it it would be very interesting im sure yes yes of course mr struthers replaced his pince nez in one convulsive movement and gave vent to a soft cough of discomfiture follow me please he was comparatively quiet while leading the three through a long corridor and down a flight of stairs then when they had entered a large well lit room that buzzed with metallic activity the sluices opened and the flood of explanation poured forth again there you are he said with pride in his voice robots only five men act as overseers and they dont even stay in this room in five years that is since we began this project not a single accident has occurred of course the robots here assembled are comparatively simple but the general managers voice had long died to a rather soothing murmur in glorias ears the whole trip seemed rather dull and pointless to her though there were many robots in sight none were even remotely like robbie though and she surveyed them with open contempt in this room there werent any people at all she noticed then her eyes fell upon six or seven robots busily engaged at a round table halfway across the room they widened in incredulous surprise it was a big room she couldnt see for sure but one of the robots looked like looked like it was robbie her shriek pierced the air and one of the robots about the table faltered and dropped the tool he was holding gloria went almost mad with joy squeezing through the railing before either parent could stop her she dropped lightly to the floor a few feet below and ran toward her robbie arms waving and hair flying and the three horrified adults as they stood frozen in their tracks saw what the excited little girl did not see a huge lumbering tractor bearing blindly down upon its appointed track it took split seconds for weston to come to his senses and those split seconds meant everything for gloria could not be overtaken although weston vaulted the railing in a wild attempt it was obviously hopeless mr struthers signalled wildly to the overseers to stop the tractor but the overseers were only human and it took time to act it was only robbie that acted immediately and with precision with metal legs eating up the space between himself and his little mistress he charged down from the opposite direction everything then happened at once with one sweep of an arm robbie snatched up gloria slackening his speed not one iota and consequently knocking every breath of air out of her weston not quite comprehending all that was happening felt rather than saw robbie brush past him and came to a sudden bewildered halt the tractor intersected glorias path half a second after robbie had rolled on ten feet further and came to a grinding long drawn out stop gloria regained her breath submitted to a series of passionate hugs on the part of both her parents and turned eagerly toward robbie as far as she was concerned nothing had happened except that she had found her friend but mrs westons expression had changed from one of relief to one of dark suspicion she turned to her husband and despite her disheveled and undignified appearance managed to look quite formidable you engineered this didnt you george weston swabbed at a hot forehead with his handkerchief his hand was unsteady and his lips could curve only into a tremulous and exceedingly weak smile mrs weston pursued the thought robbie wasnt designed for engineering or construction work he couldnt be of any use to them you had him placed there deliberately so that gloria would find him you know you did well i did said weston but grace how was i to know the reunion would be so violent and robbie has saved her life youll have to admit that you cant send him away again grace weston considered she turned toward gloria and robbie and watched them abstractedly for a moment gloria had a grip about the robots neck that would have asphyxiated any creature but one of metal and was prattling nonsense in half hysterical frenzy robbies chromesteel arms capable of bending a bar of steel two inches in diameter into a pretzel wound about the little girl gently and lovingly and his eyes glowed a deep deep red well said mrs weston at last i guess he can stay with us until he rusts susan calvin shrugged her shoulders of course he didnt that was by we had invented the mobile speaking robot which of course made all the non speaking models out of date and which seemed to be the final straw as far as the non robot elements were concerned most of the world governments banned robot use on earth for any purpose other than scientific research between and so that gloria had to give up robbie eventually im afraid so i imagine however that it was easier for her at the age of fifteen than at eight still it was a stupid and unnecessary attitude on the part of humanity u s robots hit its low point financially just about the time i joined them in at first i thought my job might come to a sudden end in a matter of months but then we simply developed the extra terrestrial market and then you were set of course not quite we began by trying to adapt the models we had on hand those first speaking models for instance they were about twelve feet high very clumsy and not much good we sent them out to mercury to help build the mining station there but that failed i looked up in surprise it did why mercury mines is a multi billion dollar concern it is now but it was a second attempt that succeeded it you want to know about that young man id advise you to look up gregory powell he and michael donovan handled our most difficult cases in the teens and twenties i havent heard from donovan in years but powell is living right here in new york hes a grandfather now which is a thought difficult to get used to i can only think of him as a rather young man of course i was younger too i tried to keep her talking if you would give me the bare bones dr calvin i can have mr powell fill it in afterward and this was exactly what i later did she spread her thin hands out upon the desk and looked at them there are two or three she said that i know a little about start with mercury i suggested well i think it was in that the second mercury expedition was sent out it was exploratory and financed in part by u s robots and in part by solar minerals it consisted of a new type robot still experimental gregory powell michael donovan runaround it was one of gregory powells favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained from excitement so when mike donovan came leaping down the stairs toward him red hair matted with perspiration powell frowned whats wrong he said break a fingernail yaaaah snarled donovan feverishly what have you been doing in the sublevels all day he took a deep breath and blurted out speedy never returned powells eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs then he recovered and resumed his upward steps he didnt speak until he reached the head of the flight and then you sent him after the selenium yes and how long has he been out five hours now silence this was a devil of a situation here they were on mercury exactly twelve hours and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble mercury had long been the jinx world of the system but this was drawing it rather strong even for a jinx powell said start at the beginning and lets get this straight they were in the radio room now with its already subtly antiquated equipment untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival even ten years technologically speaking meant so much compare speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in but then advances in robotics these days were tremendous powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly the air of disuse that touched everything about the room and the entire station was infinitely depressing donovan must have felt it he began i tried to locate him by radio but it was no go radio isnt any good on the mercury sunside not past two miles anyway thats one of the reasons the first expedition failed and we cant put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet skip all that what did you get i located the unorganized body signal in the short wave it was no good for anything except his position i kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map there was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket a relic of the unsuccessful first expedition and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force spreading it flat with the palm of his hand powell hands clasped across his chest watched it at long range donovans pencil pointed nervously the red cross is the selenium pool you marked it yourself which one is it interrupted powell there were three that macdougal located for us before he left i sent speedy to the nearest naturally seventeen miles away but what difference does that make there was tension in his voice there are the penciled dots that mark speedys position and for the first time powells artificial aplomb was shaken and his hands shot forward for the map are you serious this is impossible there it is growled donovan the little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red cross of the selenium pool and powells fingers went to his brown mustache the unfailing signal of anxiety donovan added in the two hours i checked on him he circled that damned pool four times it seems likely to me that hell keep that up forever do you realize the position were in powell looked up shortly and said nothing oh yes he realized the position they were in it worked itself out as simply as a syllogism the photo cell banks that alone stood between the full power of mercurys monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell the only thing that could save them was selenium the only thing that could get the selenium was speedy if speedy didnt come back no selenium no selenium no photo cell banks no photo banks well death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with bitterness well be the laughingstock of the system greg how can everything have gone so wrong so soon the great team of powell and donovan is sent out to mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the sunside mining station with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day a purely routine job too well never live it down we wont have to perhaps replied powell quietly if we dont do something quickly living anything down or even just plain living will be out of the question dont be stupid if you feel funny about it greg i dont it was criminal sending us out here with only one robot and it was your bright idea that we could handle the photo cell banks ourselves now youre being unfair it was a mutual decision and you know it all we needed was a kilogram of selenium a stillhead dielectrode plate and about three hours time and there are pools of pure selenium all over sunside macdougals spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes didnt it what the devil we couldnt have waited for next conjunction well what are we going to do powell youve got an idea i know you have or you wouldnt be so calm youre no more a hero than i am go on spill it we cant go after speedy ourselves mike not on the sunside even the new insosuits arent good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight but you know the old saying set a robot to catch a robot look mike maybe things arent so bad weve got six robots down in the sublevels that we may be able to use if they work if they work there was a glint of sudden hope in donovans eyes you mean six robots from the first expedition are you sure they may be subrobotic machines ten years is a long time as far as robot types are concerned you know no theyre robots ive spent all day with them and i know theyve got positronic brains primitive of course he placed the map in his pocket lets go down the robots were on the lowest sublevel all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content they were large extremely so and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor legs straddled out before them their heads were a good seven feet in the air donovan whistled look at the size of them will you the chests must be ten feet around thats because theyre supplied with the old mcguffy gears ive been over the insides crummiest set youve ever seen have you powered them yet no there wasnt any reason to i dont think theres anything wrong with them even the diaphragm is in reasonable order they might talk he had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke inserted the two inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robots life there was difficulty in fitting it but he managed and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion the radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier and then to the other five donovan said uneasily they havent moved no orders to do so replied powell succinctly he went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest you do you hear me the monsters head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on powell then in a harsh squawking voice like that of a medieval phonograph he grated yes master powell grinned humorlessly at donovan did you get that those were the days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on earth would be banned the makers were fighting that and they built good healthy slave complexes into the damned machines it didnt help them muttered donovan no it didnt but they sure tried he turned once more to the robot get up the robot towered upward slowly and donovans head craned and his puckered lips whistled powell said can you go out upon the surface in the light there was consideration while the robots slow brain worked then yes master good do you know what a mile is another consideration and another glow answer yes master we will take you up to the surface then and indicate a direction you will go about seventeen miles and somewhere in that general region you will meet another robot smaller than yourself you understand so far yes master you will find this robot and order him to return if he does not wish to you are to bring him back by force donovan clutched at powells sleeve why not send him for the selenium direct because i want speedy back nitwit i want to find out whats wrong with him and to the robot all right you follow me the robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled pardon master but i cannot you must mount first his clumsy arms had come together with a thwack blunt fingers interlacing powell stared and then pinched at his mustache uh oh donovans eyes bulged weve got to ride him like a horse i guess thats the idea i dont know why though i cant see yes i do i told you they were playing up robot safety in those days evidently they were going to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about without a mahout on their shoulders all the time what do we do now thats what ive been thinking muttered donovan we cant go out on the surface with a robot or without oh for the love of pete and he snapped his fingers twice he grew excited give me that map youve got i havent studied it for two hours for nothing this is a mining station whats wrong with using the tunnels the mining station was a black circle on the map and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spiderweb fashion donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map look he said the small black dots are openings to the surface and heres one maybe three miles away from the selenium pool theres a number here youd think theyd write larger a if the robots know their way around here powell shot the question and received the dull yes master in reply get your insosuit he said with satisfaction it was the first time either had worn the insosuits which marked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably the insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit but withal considerably lighter due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition composed of heat resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone dry the insosuits could withstand the full glare of mercurys sun for twenty minutes five to ten minutes more as well without actually killing the occupant and still the robots hands formed the stirrup nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which powell had been converted powells radio harshened voice boomed out are you ready to take us to exit a yes master good thought powell they might lack radio control but at least they were fitted for radio reception mount one or the other mike he said to donovan he placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward he found the seat comfortable there was the humped back of the robot evidently shaped for the purpose a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated ears whose purpose now seemed obvious powell seized the ears and twisted the head his mount turned ponderously lead on macduff but he did not feel at all lighthearted the gigantic robots moved slowly with mechanical precision through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot so that the two men had to duck hurriedly along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the air lock the long airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home forcefully to powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the first expedition with their crude robots and their start from scratch necessities they might have been a failure but their failure was a good deal better than the usual run of the systems successes the robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps that never lengthened powell said notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is earth normal its probably been like this all the ten years that this place has remained empty hows that cheap energy cheapest in the system sunpower you know and on mercurys sunside sunpower is something thats why the station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain its really a huge energy converter the heat is turned into electricity light mechanical work and what have you so that energy is supplied and the station is cooled in a simultaneous process look said donovan this is all very educational but would you mind changing the subject it so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photo cell banks mainly and that is a tender subject with me at the moment powell grunted vaguely and when donovan broke the resulting silence it was to change the subject completely listen greg what the devils wrong with speedy anyway i cant understand it its not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit but powell tried it i dont know mike you know hes perfectly adapted to a mercurian environment heat doesnt mean anything to him and hes built for the light gravity and the broken ground hes foolproof or at least he should be silence fell this time silence that lasted master said the robot we are here eh powell snapped out of a semidrowse well get us out of here out to the surface they found themselves in a tiny substation empty airless ruined donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash meteorite do you suppose he had asked powell shrugged to hell with that it doesnt matter lets get out a towering cliff of a black basaltic rock cut off the sunlight and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them before them the shadow reached out and ended in knife edge abruptness into an all but unbearable blaze of white light that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground space gasped donovan it looks like snow and it did powells eyes swept the jagged glitter of mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance this must be an unusual area he said the general albedo of mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice something like the moon you know beautiful isnt it he was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates beautiful or not a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist holy smokes the temperature is eighty centigrade powell checked his own and said um m m a little high atmosphere you know on mercury are you nuts mercury isnt really airless explained powell in absentminded fashion he was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate and the bloated fingers of the insosuit were clumsy at it there is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface vapors of the more volatile elements and compounds that are heavy enough for mercurian gravity to retain you know selenium iodine mercury gallium potassium bismuth volatile oxides the vapors sweep into the shadows and condense giving up heat its a sort of gigantic still in fact if you use your flash youll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with say hoar sulphur or maybe quicksilver dew it doesnt matter though our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely powell had adjusted the binocular attachments so that he seemed as eye stalked as a snail donovan watched tensely see anything the other did not answer immediately and when he did his voice was anxious and thoughtful theres a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool its in the right place but i dont see speedy powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robots shoulders legs straddled wide eyes straining he said i think i think yes its definitely he hes coming this way donovan followed the pointing flnger he had no binoculars but there was a tiny moving dot black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground i see him he yelled lets get going powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again and his suited hand slapped against the gargantuans barrel chest get going giddy ap yelled donovan and thumped his heels spur fashion the robots started off the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the airlessness for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound there was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing faster yelled donovan the rhythm did not change no use cried powell in reply these junk heaps are only geared to one speed do you think theyre equipped with selective flexors they had burst through the shadow and the sunlight came down in a white hot wash and poured liquidly about them donovan ducked involuntarily wow is it imagination or do i feel heat youll feel more presently was the grim reply keep your eye on speedy robot spd was near enough to be seen in detail now his graceful streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground his name was derived from his serial initials of course but it was apt nevertheless for the spd models were among the fastest robots turned out by the united states robot amp mechanical men corp hey speedy howled donovan and waved a frantic hand speedy shouted powell come here the distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily more by the efforts of speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty year old antique mounts of donovan and powell they were close enough now to notice that speedys gait included a peculiar rolling stagger a noticeable side to side lurch and then as powell waved his hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact head set radio sender in preparation for another shout speedy looked up and saw them speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment with just a tiny unsteady weave as though he were swaying in a light wind powell yelled all right speedy come here boy whereupon speedys robot voice sounded in powells ear phones for the first time it said hot dog lets play games you catch me and i catch you no love can cut our knife in two for im little buttercup sweet little buttercup whoops turning on his heel he sped off in the direction from which he had come with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust and his last words as he receded into the distance were there grew a little flower neath a great oak tree followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup donovan said weakly where did he pick up the gilbert and sullivan say greg he hes drunk or something if you hadnt told me was the bitter response id never realize it lets get back to the cliff im roasting it was powell who broke the desperate silence in the first place he said speedy isnt drunk not in the human sense because hes a robot and robots dont get drunk however theres something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness to me hes drunk stated donovan emphatically and all i know is that he thinks were playing games and were not its a matter of life and very gruesome death all right dont hurry me a robots only a robot once we find out whats wrong with him we can fix it and go on once said donovan sourly powell ignored him speedy is perfectly adapted to normal mercurian environment but this region and his arm swept wide is definitely abnormal theres our clue now where do these crystals come from they might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in mercurys sun volcanic action suggested donovan instantly and powells body tensed out of the mouths of sucklings he said in a small strange voice and remained very still for five minutes then he said listen mike what did you say to speedy when you sent him after the selenium donovan was taken aback well damn it i dont know i just told him to get it yes i know but how try to remember the exact words i said uh i said speedy we need some selenium you can get it such and such a place go get it thats all what more did you want me to say you didnt put any urgency into the order did you what for it was pure routine powell sighed well it cant be helped now but were in a fine fix he had dismounted from his robot and was sitting back against the cliff donovan joined him and they linked arms in the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat and mouse for them and just next them the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them unblinking unwavering and unconcerned unconcerned as was all this poisonous mercury as large in jinx as it was small in size powells radio voice was tense in donovans ear now look lets start with the three fundamental rules of robotics the three rules that are built most deeply into a robots positronic brain in the darkness his gloved fingers ticked off each point we have one a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm right two continued powell a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law right and three a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws right now where are we exactly at the explanation the conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain well say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it the automatic potential that rule sets up turns him back but suppose you order him to walk into that danger in that case rule sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence well i know that what about it lets take speedys case speedy is one of the latest models extremely specialized and as expensive as a battleship its not a thing to be lightly destroyed so so rule has been strengthened that was specifically mentioned by the way in the advance notices on the spd models so that his allergy to danger is unusually high at the same time when you sent him out after the selenium you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis so that the rule potential set up was rather weak now hold on im just stating facts all right go ahead i think i get it you see how it works dont you theres some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool it increases as he approaches and at a certain distance from it the rule potential unusually high to start with exactly balances the rule potential unusually low to start with donovan rose to his feet in excitement and it strikes an equilibrium i see rule drives him back and rule drives him forward so he follows a circle around the selenium pool staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium and unless we do something about it hell stay on that circle forever giving us the good old runaround then more thoughtfully and that by the way is what makes him drunk at potential equilibrium half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter im not a robot specialist but that seems obvious probably hes lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has ve e ery pretty but whats the danger if we knew what he was running from you suggested it volcanic action somewhere right above the selenium pool is a seepage of gas from the bowels of mercury sulphur dioxide carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide lots of it and at this temperature donovan gulped audibly carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl and a robot added powell is essentially iron then grimly theres nothing like deduction weve determined everything about our problem but the solution we cant get the selenium ourselves its still too far we cant send these robot horses because they cant go themselves and they cant carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping and we cant catch speedy because the dope thinks were playing games and he can run sixty miles to our four if one of us goes began donovan tentatively and comes back cooked therell still be the other yes came the sarcastic reply it would be a most tender sacrifice except that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reached the pool and i dont think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders figure it out were two or three miles from the pool call it two the robot travels at four miles an hour and we can last twenty minutes in our suits it isnt only the heat remember solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison um m m said donovan ten minutes short as good as an eternity and another thing in order for rule potential to have stopped speedy where it did there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal vapor atmosphere and there must be an appreciable corrosive action therefore hes been out hours now and how do we know when a knee joint for instance wont be thrown out of kilter and keel him over its not only a question of thinking weve got to think fast deep dark dank dismal silence donovan broke it voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless he said as long as we cant increase rule potential by giving further orders how about working the other way if we increase the danger we increase rule potential and drive him backward powells visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question you see came the cautious explanation all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity well back at the station theres a complete analytical laboratory naturally assented powell its a mining station all right there must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations holy space mike youre a genius so so admitted donovan modestly its just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on heating decomposes into carbon dioxide water and good old carbon monoxide college chem you know powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machines thigh hey he shouted can you throw master never mind powell damned the robots molasses slow brain he scrabbled up a jagged brick size rock take this he said and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across the crooked fissure you see it donovan pulled at his shoulder too far greg its almost half a mile off quiet replied powell its a case of mercurian gravity and a steel throwing arm watch will you the robots eyes were measuring the distance with machinely accurate stereoscopy his arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back in the darkness the robots motions went unseen but there was a sudden thumping sound as he shifted his weight and seconds later the rock flew blackly into the sunlight there was no air resistance to slow it down nor wind to turn it aside and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the blue patch powell yelled happily and shouted lets go back after the oxalic acid mike and as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels donovan said grimly speedys been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool ever since we chased after him did you see him yes i guess he wants to play games well well play him games they were back hours later with three liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces the photo cell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely the two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting speedy in silence and with grim purpose speedy galloped slowly toward them here we are again whee ive made a little list the piano organist all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face well puff something in your face muttered donovan hes limping greg i noticed that came the low worried response the monoxidell get him yet if we dont hurry they were approaching cautiously now almost sidling to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot powell was too far off to tell of course but even already he could have sworn the crack brained speedy was setting himself for a spring let her go he gasped count three one two two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun and in a pair of soundless puffs they hit the ground behind speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust in the full heat of mercurys sun powell knew it was fizzing like soda water speedy turned to stare then backed away from it slowly and as slowly gathered speed in fifteen seconds he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter powell did not get speedys words just then though he heard something that resembled lovers professions when uttered in hessians he turned away back to the cliff mike hes out of the rut and hell be taking orders now im getting hot they jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that donovan looked back greg powell looked and almost shrieked speedy was moving slowly now so slowly and in the wrong direction he was drifting drifting back into his rut and he was picking up speed he looked dreadfully close and dreadfully unreachable in the binoculars donovan shouted wildly after him and thumped his robot into its pace but powell called him back you wont catch him mike its no use he fidgeted on his robots shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence why the devil do i see these things five seconds after its all over mike weve wasted hours we need more oxalic acid declared donovan stolidly the concentration wasnt high enough seven tons of it wouldnt have been enough and we havent the hours to spare to get it even if it were with the monoxide chewing him away dont you see what it is mike and donovan said flatly no we were only establishing new equilibriums when we create new monoxide and increase rule potential he moves backward till hes in balance again and when the monoxide drifted away he moved forward and again there was balance powells voice sounded thoroughly wretched its the same old runaround we can push at rule and pull at rule and we cant get anywhere we can only change the position of balance weve got to get outside both rules and then he pushed his robot closer to donovans so that they were sitting face to face dim shadows in the darkness and he whispered mike is it the finish dully i suppose we go back to the station wait for the banks to fold shake hands take cyanide and go out like gentlemen he laughed shortly mike repeated powell earnestly weve got to get speedy i know mike once more and powell hesitated before continuing theres always rule i thought of it earlier but its desperate donovan looked up and his voice livened were desperate all right according to rule a robot cant see a human come to harm because of his own inaction two and cant stand against it they cant mike even when the robot is half cra well hes drunk you know he is its the chances you take cut it what are you going to do im going out there now and see what rule will do if it wont break the balance then what the devil its either now or three four days from now hold on greg there are human rules of behavior too you dont go out there just like that figure out a lottery and give me my chance all right first to get the cube of fourteen goes and almost immediately twenty seven forty four donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by powells mount and then powell was off into the sunlight donovan opened his mouth to shout and then clicked it shut of course the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance and on purpose just like him the sun was hotter than ever and powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his back imagination probably or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit speedy was watching him without a word of gilbert and sullivan gibberish as greeting thank god for that but he darent get too close he was three hundred yards away when speedy began backing a step at a time cautiously and powell stopped he jumped from his robots shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments he proceeded on foot the ground gritty and slippery to his steps the low gravity causing him difficulty the soles of his feet tickled with warmth he cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliffs shadow and realized that he had come too far to return either by himself or by the help of his antique robot it was speedy or nothing now and the knowledge of that constricted his chest far enough he stopped speedy he called speedy the sleek modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps then resumed them powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice and found it didnt take much acting speedy ive got to get back to the shadow or the sunll get me its life or death speedy i need you speedy took one step forward and stopped he spoke but at the sound powell groaned for it was when youre lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed it trailed off there and powell took time out for some reason to murmur iolanthe it was roasting hot he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye and whirled dizzily then stared in utter astonishment for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving moving toward him and without a rider he was talking pardon master i must not move without a master upon me but you are in danger of course rule potential above everything but he didnt want that clumsy antique he wanted speedy he walked away and motioned frantically i order you to stay away i order you to stop it was quite useless you could not beat rule potential the robot said stupidly you are in danger master powell looked about him desperately he couldnt see clearly his brain was in a heated whirl his breath scorched when he breathed and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze he called a last time desperately speedy im dying damn you where are you speedy i need you he was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant robot he didnt want when he felt steel fingers on his arms and a worried apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears holy smokes boss what are you doing here and what am i doing im so confused never mind murmured powell weakly get me to the shadow of the cliff and hurry there was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning heat and he passed out he woke with donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously how are you greg fine came the response wheres speedy right here i sent him out to one of the other selenium pools with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time he got it back in forty two minutes and three seconds i timed him he still hasnt finished apologizing for the runaround he gave us hes scared to come near you for fear of what youll say drag him over ordered powell it wasnt his fault he held out a hand and gripped speedys metal paw its o k speedy then to donovan you know mike i was just thinking yes well he rubbed his face the air was so delightfully cool you know that when we get things set up here and speedy put through his field tests theyre going to send us to the space stations next no yes at least thats what old lady calvin told me just before we left and i didnt say anything about it because i was going to fight the whole idea fight it cried donovan but i know its all right with me now two hundred seventy three degrees centigrade below zero wont it be a pleasure space station said donovan here i come reason half a year later the boys had changed their minds the flame of a giant sun had given way to the soft blackness of space but external variations mean little in the business of checking the workings of experimental robots whatever the background one is face to face with an inscrutable positronic brain which the slide rule geniuses say should work thus and so except that they dont powell and donovan found that out after they had been on the station less than two weeks gregory powell spaced his words for emphasis one week ago donovan and i put you together his brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache it was quiet in the officers room on solar station except for the soft purring of the mighty beam director somewhere far below robot qt sat immovable the burnished plates of his body gleamed in the luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes were fixed steadily upon the earthman at the other side of the table powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves these robots possessed peculiar brains oh the three laws of robotics held they had to all of u s robots from robertson himself to the new floor sweeper would insist on that so qt was safe and yet the qt models were the first of their kind and this was the first of the qts mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact finally the robot spoke his voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm do you realize the seriousness of such a statement powell something made you cutie pointed out powell you admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago im giving you the explanation donovan and i put you together from the parts shipped us cutie gazed upon his long supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification it strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that for you to make me seems improbable the earthman laughed quite suddenly in earths name why call it intuition thats all it is so far but i intend to reason it out though a chain of valid reasoning can end only with the determination of truth and ill stick till i get there powell stood up and seated himself at the tables edge next to the robot he felt a sudden strong sympathy for this strange machine it was not at all like the ordinary robot attending to his specialized task at the station with the intensity of a deeply ingrooved positronic path he placed a hand upon cuties steel shoulder and the metal was cold and hard to the touch cutie he said im going to try to explain something to you youre the first robot whos ever exhibited curiosity as to his own existence and i think the first thats really intelligent enough to understand the world outside here come with me the robot rose erect smoothly and his thickly sponge rubber soled feet made no noise as he followed powell the earthman touched a button and a square section of the wall flickered aside the thick clear glass revealed space starspeckled ive seen that in the observation ports in the engine room said cutie i know said powell what do you think it is exactly what it seems a black material just beyond this glass that is spotted with little gleaming dots i know that our director sends out beams to some of these dots always to the same ones and also that these dots shift and that the beams shift with them that is all good now i want you to listen carefully the blackness is emptinessvast emptiness stretching out infinitely the little gleaming dots are huge masses of energy filled matter they are globes some of them millions of miles in diameterand for comparison this station is only one mile across they seem so tiny because they are incredibly far off the dots to which our energy beams are directed are nearer and much smaller they are cold and hard and human beings like myself live upon their surfaces many billions of them it is from one of these worlds that donovan and i come our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us we call that globe the sun and it is on the other side of the station where you cant see it cutie remained motionless before the port like a steel statue his head did not turn as he spoke which particular dot of light do you claim to come from powell searched there it is the very bright one in the corner we call it earth he grinned good old earth there are three billions of us there cutie and in about two weeks ill be back there with them and then surprisingly enough cutie hummed abstractedly there was no tune to it but it possessed a curious twanging quality as of plucked strings it ceased as suddenly as it had begun but where do i come in powell you havent explained my existence the rest is simple when these stations were first established to feed solar energy to the planets they were run by humans however the heat the hard solar radiations and the electron storms made the post a difficult one robots were developed to replace human labor and now only two human executives are required for each station we are trying to replace even those and thats where you come in youre the highest type of robot ever developed and if you show the ability to run this station independently no human need ever come here again except to bring parts for repairs his hand went up and the metal visi lid snapped back into place powell returned to the table and polished an apple upon his sleeve before biting into it the red glow of the robots eyes held him do you expect me said cutie slowly to believe any such complicated implausible hypothesis as you have just outlined what do you take me for powell sputtered apple fragments onto the table and turned red why damn you it wasnt a hypothesis those were facts cutie sounded grim globes of energy millions of miles across worlds with three billion humans on them infinite emptiness sorry powell but i dont believe it ill puzzle this thing out for myself good by he turned and stalked out of the room he brushed past michael donovan on the threshold with a grave nod and passed down the corridor oblivious to the astounded stare that followed him mike donovan rumpled his red hair and shot an annoyed glance at powell what was that walking junk yard talking about what doesnt he believe the other dragged at his mustache bitterly hes a skeptic was the bitter response he doesnt believe we made him or that earth exists or space or stars sizzling saturn weve got a lunatic robot on our hands he says hes going to figure it ail out for himself well now said donovan sweetly i do hope hell condescend to explain it all to me after hes puzzled everything out then with sudden rage listen if that metal mess gives me any lip like that ill knock that chromium cranium right off its torso he seated himself with a jerk and drew a paper backed mystery novel out of his inner jacket pocket that robot gives me the willies anyway too damned inquisitive mike donovan growled from behind a huge lettuce and tomato sandwich as cutie knocked gently and entered is powell here donovans voice was muffled with pauses for mastication hes gathering data on electronic stream functions were heading for a storm looks like gregory powell entered as he spoke eyes on the graphed paper in his hands and dropped into a chair he spread the sheets out before him and began scribbling calculations donovan stared over his shoulder crunching lettuce and dribbling bread crumbs cutie waited silently powell looked up the zeta potential is rising but slowly just the same the stream functions are erratic and i dont know what to expect oh hello cutie i thought you were supervising the installation of the new drive bar its done said the robot quietly and so ive come to have a talk with the two of you oh powell looked uncomfortable well sit down no not that chair one of the legs is weak and youre no lightweight the robot did so and said placidly i have come to a decision donovan glowered and put the remnants of his sandwich aside if its on any of that screwy the other motioned impatiently for silence go ahead cutie were listening i have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection said cutie and the results have been most interesting i began at the one sure assumption i felt permitted to make i myself exist because i think powell groaned oh jupiter a robot descartes whos descartes demanded donovan listen do we have to sit here and listen to this metal maniac keep quiet mike cutie continued imperturbably and the question that immediately arose was just what is the cause of my existence powells jaw set lumpily youre being foolish i told you already that we made you and if you dont believe us added donovan well gladly take you apart the robot spread his strong hands in a deprecatory gesture i accept nothing on authority a hypothesis must be backed by reason or else it is worthless and it goes against all the dictates of logic to suppose that you made me powell dropped a restraining arm upon donovans suddenly bunched fist just why do you say that cutie laughed it was a very inhuman laugh the most machine like utterance he had yet given vent to it was sharp and explosive as regular as a metronome and as uninflected look at you he said finally i say this in no spirit of contempt but look at you the material you are made of is soft and flabby lacking endurance and strength depending for energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material like that he pointed a disapproving finger at what remained of donovans sandwich periodically you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature air pressure humidity or radiation intensity impairs your efficiency you are makeshift i on the other hand am a finished product i absorb electrical energy directly and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency i am composed of strong metal am continuously conscious and can stand extremes of environment easily these are facts which with the self evident proposition that no being can create another being superior to itself smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing donovans muttered curses rose into intelligibility as he sprang to his feet rusty eyebrows drawn low all right you son of a hunk of iron ore if we didnt make you who did cutie nodded gravely very good donovan that was indeed the next question evidently my creator must be more powerful than myself and so there was only one possibility the earthmen looked blank and cutie continued what is the center of activities here in the station what do we all serve what absorbs all our attention he waited expectantly donovan turned a startled look upon his companion ill bet this tinplated screwball is talking about the energy converter itself is that right cutie grinned powell i am talking about the master came the cold sharp answer it was the signal for a roar of laughter from donovan and powell himself dissolved into a half suppressed giggle cutie had risen to his feet and his gleaming eyes passed from one earthman to the other it is so just the same and i dont wonder that you refuse to believe you two are not long to stay here im sure powell himself said that at first only men served the master that there followed robots for the routine work and finally myself for the executive labor the facts are no doubt true but the explanation entirely illogical do you want the truth behind it all go ahead cutie youre amusing the master created humans first as the lowest type most easily formed gradually he replaced them by robots the next higher step and finally he created me to take the place of the last humans from now on i serve the master youll do nothing of the sort said powell sharply youll follow our orders and keep quiet until were satisfied that you can run the converter get that the converter not the master if you dont satisfy us you will be dismantled and now if you dont mind you can leave and take this data with you and file it properly cutie accepted the graphs handed him and left without another word donovan leaned back heavily in his chair and shoved thick fingers through his hair theres going to be trouble with that robot hes pure nuts the drowsy hum of the converter is louder in the control room and mixed with it is the chuckle of the geiger counters and the erratic buzzing of half a dozen little signal lights donovan withdrew his eye from the telescope and flashed the luxites on the beam from station caught mars on schedule we can break ours now powell nodded abstractedly cuties down in the engine room ill flash the signal and he can take care of it look mike what do you think of these figures the other cocked an eye at them and whistled boy thats what i call gamma ray intensity old sol is feeling his oats all right yeah was the sour response and were in a bad position for an electron storm too our earth beam is right in the probable path he shoved his chair away from the table pettishly nuts if it would only hold off till relief got here but thats ten days off say mike go on down and keep an eye on cutie will you o k throw me some of those almonds he snatched at the bag thrown him and headed for the elevator it slid smoothly downward and opened onto a narrow catwalk in the huge engine room donovan leaned over the railing and looked down the huge generators were in motion and from the l tubes came the lowpitched whir that pervaded the entire station he could make out cuties large gleaming figure at the martian l tube watching closely as the team of robots worked in close knit unison and then donovan stiffened the robots dwarfed by the mighty l tube lined up before it heads bowed at a stiff angle while cutie walked up and down the line slowly fifteen seconds passed and then with a clank heard above the clamorous purring all about they fell to their knees donovan squawked and raced down the narrow staircase he came charging down upon them complexion matching his hair and clenched fists beating the air furiously what the devil is this you brainless lumps come on get busy with that l tube if you dont have it apart cleaned and together again before the day is out ill coagulate your brains with alternating current not a robot moved even cutie at the far end the only one on his feet remained silent eyes fixed upon the gloomy recesses of the vast machine before him donovan shoved hard against the nearest robot stand up he roared slowly the robot obeyed his photoelectric eyes focused reproachfully upon the earthman there is no master but the master he said and qt is his prophet huh donovan became aware of twenty pairs of mechanical eyes fixed upon him and twenty stiff timbred voices declaiming solemnly there is no master but the master and qt is his prophet im afraid put in cutie himself at this point that my friends obey a higher one than you now the hell they do you get out of here ill settle with you later and with these animated gadgets right now cutie shook his heavy head slowly im sorry but you dont understand these are robots and that means they are reasoning beings they recognize the master now that i have preached truth to them all the robots do they call me the prophet his head drooped i am unworthy but perhaps donovan located his breath and put it to use is that so now isnt that nice now isnt that just fine just let me tell you something my brass baboon there isnt any master and there isnt any prophet and there isnt any question as to whos giving the orders understand his voice shot to a roar now get out i obey only the master damn the master donovan spat at the l tube that for the master do as i say cutie said nothing nor did any other robot but donovan became aware of a sudden heightening of tension the cold staring eyes deepened their crimson and cutie seemed stiffer than ever sacrilege he whispered voice metallic with emotion donovan felt the first sudden touch of fear as cutie approached a robot could not feel anger but cuties eyes were unreadable i am sorry donovan said the robot but you can no longer stay here after this henceforth powell and you are barred from the control room and the engine room his hand gestured quietly and in a moment two robots had pinned donovans arms to his sides donovan had time for one startled gasp as he felt himself lifted from the floor and carried up the stairs at a pace rather better than a canter gregory powell raced up and down the officers room fist tightly balled he cast a look of furious frustration at the closed door and scowled bitterly at donovan why the devil did you have to spit at the l tube mike donovan sunk deep in his chair slammed at its arms savagely what did you expect me to do with that electrified scarecrow im not going to knuckle under to any do jigger i put together myself no came back sourly but here you are in the officers room with two robots standing guard at the door thats not knuckling under is it donovan snarled wait till we get back to base someones going to pay for this those robots must obey us its the second law whats the use of saying that they arent obeying us and theres probably some reason for it that well figure out too late by the way do you know whats going to happen to us when we get back to base he stopped before donovans chair and stared savagely at him what oh nothing just back to mercury mines for twenty years or maybe ceres penitentiary what are you talking about the electron storm thats coming up do you know its heading straight dead center across the earth beam i had just figured that out when that robot dragged me out of my chair donovan was suddenly pale sizzling saturn and do you know whats going to happen to the beam because the storm will be a lulu its going to jump like a flea with the itch with only cutie at the controls its going to go out of focus and if it does heaven help earth and us donovan was wrenching at the door wildly when powell was only half through the door opened and the earthman shot through to come up hard against an immovable steel arm the robot stared abstractedly at the panting struggling earthman the prophet orders you to remain please do his arm shoved donovan reeled backward and as he did so cutie turned the corner at the far end of the corridor he motioned the guardian robots away entered the officers room and closed the door gently donovan whirled on cutie in breathless indignation this has gone far enough youre going to pay for this farce please dont be annoyed replied the robot mildly it was bound to come eventually anyway you see you two have lost your function i beg your pardon powell drew himself up stiffly just what do you mean weve lost our function until i was created answered cube you tended the master that privilege is mine now and your only reason for existence has vanished isnt that obvious not quite replied powell bitterly but what do you expect us to do now cutie did not answer immediately he remained silent as if in thought and then one arm shot out and draped itself about powells shoulder the other grasped donovans wrist and drew him closer i like you two youre inferior creatures with poor reasoning faculties but i really feel a sort of affection for you you have served the master well and he will reward you for that now that your service is over you will probably not exist much longer but as long as you do you shall be provided food clothing and shelter so long as you stay out of the control room and the engine room hes pensioning us off greg yelled donovan do something about it its humiliating look here cutie we cant stand for this were the bosses this station is only a creation of human beings like me human beings that live on earth and other planets this is only an energy relay youre only aw nuts cutie shook his head gravely this amounts to an obsession why should you insist so on an absolutely false view of life admitted that non robots lack the reasoning faculty there is still the problem of his voice died into reflective silence and donovan said with whispered intensity if you only had a flesh and blood face i would break it in powells fingers were in his mustache and his eyes were slitted listen cutie if there is no such thing as earth how do you account for what you see through a telescope pardon me the earthman smiled ive got you eh youve made quite a few telescopic observations since being put together cutie have you noticed that several of those specks of light outside become disks when so viewed oh that why certainly it is simple magnification for the purpose of more exact aiming of the beam why arent the stars equally magnified then you mean the other dots well no beams go to them so no magnification is necessary really powell even you ought to be able to figure these things out powell stared bleakly upward but you see more stars through a telescope where do they come from jumping jupiter where do they come from cutie was annoyed listen powell do you think im going to waste my time trying to pin physical interpretations upon every optical illusion of our instruments since when is the evidence of our senses any match for the clear light of rigid reason look clamored donovan suddenly writhing out from under cuties friendly but metal heavy arm lets get to the nub of the thing why the beams at all were giving you a good logical explanation can you do better the beams was the stiff reply are put out by the master for his own purposes there are some things he raised his eyes devoutly upward that are not to be probed into by us in this matter i seek only to serve and not to question powell sat down slowly and buried his face in shaking hands get out of here cutie get out and let me think ill send you food said cutie agreeably a groan was the only answer and the robot left greg was donovans huskily whispered observation this calls for strategy weve got to get him when he isnt expecting it and shortcircuit him concentrated nitric acid in his joints dont be a dope mike do you suppose hes going to let us get near him with acid in our hands weve got to talk to him i tell you weve got to argue him into letting us back into the control room inside of forty eight hours or our goose is broiled to a crisp he rocked back and forth in an agony of impotence who the heck wants to argue with a robot its its mortifying finished donovan worse say donovan laughed suddenly why argue lets show him lets build us another robot right before his eyes hell have to eat his words then a slowly widening smile appeared on powells face donovan continued and think of that screwballs face when he sees us do it robots are of course manufactured on earth but their shipment through apace is much simpler if it can be done in parts to be put together at their place of use it also incidentally eliminates the possibility of robots in complete adjustment wandering off while still on earth and thus bringing u s robots face to face with the strict laws against robots on earth still it placed upon men such as powell and donovan the necessity of synthesis of complete robots a grievous and complicated task powell and donovan were never so aware of that fact as upon that particular day when in the assembly room they undertook to create a robot under the watchful eyes of qt prophet of the master the robot in question a simple mc model lay upon the table almost complete three hours work left only the bead undone and powell paused to swab his forehead and glanced uncertainly at cutie the glance was not a reassuring one for three hours cutie had sat speechless and motionless and his face inexpressive at all times was now absolutely unreadable powell groaned lets get the brain in now mike donovan uncapped the tightly sealed container and from the oil bath within he withdrew a second cube opening this in turn he removed a globe from its sponge rubber casing he handled it gingerly for it was the most complicated mechanism ever created by man inside the thin platinumplated skin of the globe was a positronic brain in whose delicately unstable structure were enforced calculated neuronic paths which imbued each robot with what amounted to a pre natal education it fitted snugly into the cavity in the skull of the robot on the table blue metal closed over it and was welded tightly by the tiny atomic flare photoelectric eyes were attached carefully screwed tightly into place and covered by thin transparent sheets of steel hard plastic the robot awaited only the vitalizing flash of high voltage electricity and powell paused with his hand on the switch now watch this cutie watch this carefully the switch rammed home and there was a crackling hum the two earthmen bent anxiously over their creation there was vague motion only at the outset a twitching of the joints the bead lifted elbows propped it up and the mc model swung clumsily off the table its footing was unsteady and twice abortive grating sounds were all it could do in the direction of speech finally its voice uncertain and hesitant took form i would like to start work where must i go donovan sprang to the door down these stairs he said you will be told what to do the mc model was gone and the two earthmen were alone with the still unmoving cutie well said powell grinning now do you believe that we made you cuties answer was curt and final no he said powells grin froze and then relaxed slowly donovans mouth dropped open and remained so you see continued cutie easily you have merely put together parts already made you did remarkably well instinct i suppose but you didnt really create the robot the parts were created by the master listen gasped donovan hoarsely those parts were manufactured back on earth and sent here well well replied cutie soothingly we wont argue no i mean it the earthman sprang forward and grasped the robots metal arm if you were to read the books in the library they could explain it so that there could be no possible doubt the books ive read them all of them theyre most ingenious powell broke in suddenly if youve read them what else is there to say you cant dispute their evidence you just cant there was pity in cuties voice please powell i certainly dont consider them a valid source of information they too were created by the master and were meant for you not for me how do you make that out demanded powell because i a reasoning being am capable of deducing truth from a priori causes you being intelligent but unreasoning need an explanation of existence supplied to you and this the master did that he supplied you with these laughable ideas of far off worlds and people is no doubt for the best your minds are probably too coarsely grained for absolute truth however since it is the masters will that you believe your books i wont argue with you any more as he left he turned and said in a kindly tone but dont feel badly in the masters scheme of things there is room for all you poor humans have your place and though it is humble you will be rewarded if you fill it well he departed with a beatific air suiting the prophet of the master and the two humans avoided each others eyes finally powell spoke with an effort lets go to bed mike i give up donovan said in a hushed voice say greg you dont suppose hes right about all this do you he sounds so confident that i powell whirled on him dont be a fool youd find out whether earth exists when relief gets here next week and we have to go back to face the music then for the love of jupiter weve got to do something donovan was half in tears he doesnt believe us or the books or his eyes no said powell bitterly hes a reasoning robot damn it he believes only reason and theres one trouble with that his voice trailed away whats that prompted donovan you can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason if you pick the proper postulates we have ours and cutie has his then lets get at those postulates in a hurry the storms due tomorrow powell sighed wearily thats where everything falls down postulates are based on assumption and adhered to by faith nothing in the universe can shake them im going to bed oh hell i cant sleep neither can but i might as well try as a matter of principle twelve hours later sleep was still just that a matter of principle unattainable in practice the storm had arrived ahead of schedule and donovans florid face drained of blood as he pointed a shaking finger powell stubble jawed and dry lipped stared out the port and pulled desperately at his mustache under other circumstances it might have been a beautiful sight the stream of high speed electrons impinging upon the energy beam fluoresced into ultra spicules of intense light the beam stretched out into shrinking nothingness a glitter with dancing shining motes the shaft of energy was steady but the two earthmen knew the value of naked eyed appearances deviations in arc of a hundredth of a millisecond invisible to the eye were enough to send the beam wildly out of focus enough to blast hundreds of square miles of earth into incandescent ruin and a robot unconcerned with beam focus or earth or anything but his master was at the controls hours passed the earthmen watched in hypnotized silence and then the darting dotlets of light dimmed and went out the storm had ended powells voice was flat its over donovan had fallen into a troubled slumber and powells weary eyes rested upon him enviously the signal flash glared over and over again but the earthman paid no attention it all was unimportant all perhaps cutie was right and he was only an inferior being with a made to order memory and a life that had outlived its purpose he wished he were cutie was standing before him you didnt answer the flash so i walked in his voice was low you dont look at all well and im afraid your term of existence is drawing to an end still would you like to see some of the readings recorded today dimly powell was aware that the robot was making a friendly gesture perhaps to quiet some lingering remorse in forcibly replacing the humans at the controls of the station he accepted the sheets held out to him and gazed at them unseeingly cutie seemed pleased of course it is a great privilege to serve the master you mustnt feel too badly about my having replaced you powell grunted and shifted from one sheet to the other mechanically until his blurred sight focused upon a thin red line that wobbled its way across the ruled paper he stared and stared again he gripped it hard in both fists and rose to his feet still staring the other sheets dropped to the floor unheeded mike mike he was shaking the other madly he held it steady donovan came to life what wh where and he too gazed with bulging eyes upon the record before him cutie broke in what is wrong you kept it in focus stuttered powell did you know that focus whats that you kept the beam directed sharply at the receiving station to within a ten thousandth of a milli second of arc what receiving station on earth the receiving station on earth babbled powell you kept it in focus cutie turned on his heel in annoyance it is impossible to perform any act of kindness toward you two always the same phantasm i merely kept all dials at equilibrium in accordance with the will of the master gathering the scattered papers together he withdrew stiffly and donovan said as he left well ill be damned he turned to powell what are we going to do now powell felt tired but uplifted nothing hes just shown he can run the station perfectly ive never seen an electron storm handled so well but nothings solved you heard what he said of the master we cant look mike he follows the instructions of the master by means of dials instruments and graphs thats all we ever followed as a matter of fact it accounts for his refusal to obey us obedience is the second law no harm to humans is the first how can he keep humans from harm whether he knows it or not why by keeping the energy beam stable he knows he can keep it more stable than we can since he insists hes the superior being so he must keep us out of the control room its inevitable if you consider the laws of robotics sure but thats not the point we cant let him continue this nitwit stuff about the master why not because whoever heard of such a damned thing how are we going to trust him with the station if he doesnt believe in earth can he handle the station yes but then whats the difference what he believes powell spread his arms outward with a vague smile upon his face and tumbled backward onto the bed he was asleep powell was speaking while struggling into his lightweight space jacket it would be a simple job he said you can bring in new qt models one by one equip them with an automatic shutoff switch to act within the week so as to allow them enough time to learn the uh cult of the master from the prophet himself then switch them to another station and revitalize them we could have two qts per donovan unclasped his glassite visor and scowled shut up and lets get out of here relief is waiting and i wont feel right until i actually see earth and feel the ground under my feet just to make sure its really there the door opened as he spoke and donovan with a smothered curse clicked the visor to and turned a sulky back upon cutie the robot approached softly and there was sorrow in his voice you are going powell nodded curtly there will be others in our place cutie sighed with the sound of wind humming through closely spaced wires your term of service is over and the time of dissolution has come i expected it but well the masters will be done his tone of resignation stung powell save the sympathy cube were heading for earth not dissolution it is best that you think so cutie sighed again i see the wisdom of the illusion now i would not attempt to shake your faith even if i could he departed the picture of commiseration powell snarled and motioned to donovan sealed suitcases in hand they headed for the air lock the relief ship was on the outer landing and franz muller his relief man greeted them with stiff courtesy donovan made scant acknowledgment and passed into the pilot room to take over the controls from sam evans powell lingered hows earth it was a conventional enough question and muller gave the conventional answer still spinning powell said good muller looked at him the boys back at the u s robots nave dreamed up a new one by the way a multiple robot a what what i said theres a big contract for it it must be just the thing for asteroid mining you have a master robot with six sub robots under it like your fingers has it been field tested asked powell anxiously muller smiled waiting for you i hear powells fist balled damn it we need a vacation oh youll get it two weeks i think he was donning the heavy space gloves in preparation for his term of duty here and his thick eyebrows drew close together how is this new robot getting along it better be good or ill be damned if i let it touch the controls powell paused before answering his eyes swept the proud prussian before him from the close cropped hair on the sternly stubborn head to the feet standing stiffly at attention and there was a sudden glow of pure gladness surging through him the robot is pretty good he said slowly i dont think youll have to bother much with the controls he grinned and went into the ship muller would be here for several weeks catch that rabbit the vacation was longer than two weeks that mike donovan had to admit it had been six months with pay he admitted that too but that as he explained furiously was fortuitous u s robots had to get the bugs out of the multiple robot and there were plenty of bugs and there are always at least half a dozen bugs left for the fieldtesting so they waited and relaxed until the drawing board men and the slide rule boys had said ok and now he and powell were out on the asteroid and it was not ok he repeated that a dozen times with a face that had gone beety for the love of pete greg get realistic whats the use of adhering to the letter of the specifications and watching the test go to pot its about time you got the red tape out of your pants and went to work im only saying said gregory powell patiently as one explaining electronics to an idiot child that according to spec those robots are equipped for asteroid mining without supervision were not supposed to watch them all right look logic he lifted his hairy fingers and pointed one that new robot passed every test in the home laboratories two united states robots guaranteed their passing the test of actual performance on an asteroid three the robots are not passing said tests four if they dont pass united states robots loses ten million credits in cash and about one hundred million in reputation five if they dont pass and we cant explain why they dont pass it is just possible two good jobs may have to be bidden a fond farewell powell groaned heavy behind a noticeably insincere smile the unwritten motto of united states robot and mechanical men corp was well known no employee makes the same mistake twice he is fired the first time aloud he said youre as lucid as euclid with everything except the facts youve watched that robot group for three shifts you redhead and they did their work perfectly you said so yourself what else can we do find out whats wrong thats what we can do so they did work perfectly when i watched them but on three different occasions when i didnt watch them they didnt bring in any ore they didnt even come back on schedule i had to go after them and was anything wrong not a thing not a thing everything was perfect smooth and perfect as the luminiferous ether only one little insignificant detail disturbed me there was no ore powell scowled at the ceiling and pulled at his brown mustache ill tell you what mike weve been stuck with pretty lousy jobs in our time but this takes the iridium asteroid the whole business is complicated past endurance look that robot dv has six robots under it and not just under it theyre part of it i know that shut up said powell savagely i know you know it but im just describing the hell of it those six subsidiaries are part of dv like your fingers are part of you and it gives them their orders neither by voice nor radio but directly through positronic fields now there isnt a roboticist back at united states robots that knows what a positronic field is or how it works and neither do i neither do you the last agreed donovan philosophically i know then look at our position if everything works fine if anything goes wrong were out of our depth and there probably isnt a thing we can do or anybody else but the job belongs to us and not to anyone else so were on the spot mike he blazed away for a moment in silence then all right have you got him outside yes is everything normal now well he hasnt got religious mania and he isnt running around in a circle spouting gilbert and sullivan so i suppose hes normal donovan passed out the door shaking his head viciously powell reached for the handbook of robotics that weighed down one side of his desk to a near founder and opened it reverently he had once jumped out of the window of a burning house dressed only in shorts and the handbook in a pinch he would have skipped the shorts the handbook was propped up before him when robot dv entered with donovan kicking the door shut behind him powell said somberly hi dave how do you feel fine said the robot mind if i sit down he dragged up the specially reinforced chair that was his and folded gently into it powell regarded dave laymen might think of robots by their serial numbers roboticists never with approval it was not over massive by any means in spite of its construction as thinking unit of an integrated seven unit robot team it was seven feet tall and a half ton of metal and electricity a lot not when that half ton has to be a mass of condensers circuits relays and vacuum cells that can handle practically any psychological reaction known to humans and a positronic brain which with ten pounds of matter and a few quintillions of positrons runs the whole show powell groped in his shirt pocket for a loose cigarette dave he said youre a good fellow theres nothing flighty or prima donnaish about you youre a stable rockbottom mining robot except that youre equipped to handle six subsidiaries in direct coordination as far as i know that has not introduced any unstable paths in your brain path map the robot nodded that makes me feel swell but what are you getting at boss he was equipped with an excellent diaphragm and the presence of overtones in the sound unit robbed him of much of that metallic flatness that marks the usual robot voice im going to tell you with all that in your favor whats going wrong with your job for instance todays b shift dave hesitated as far as i know nothing you didnt produce any ore i know well then dave was having trouble i cant explain that boss its been giving me a case of nerves or it would if i let it my subsidiaries worked smoothly i know i did he considered his photoelectric eyes glowing intensely then i dont remember the day ended and there was mike and there were the ore cars mostly empty donovan broke in you didnt report at shift end those days dave you know that i know but as to why he shook his head slowly and ponderously powell had the queasy feeling that if the robots face were capable of expression it would be one of pain and mortification a robot by its very nature cannot bear to fail its function donovan dragged his chair up to powells desk and leaned over amnesia do you think cant say but theres no use in trying to pin disease names on this human disorders apply to robots only as romantic analogies theyre no help to robotic engineering he scratched his neck i hate to put him through the elementary brain reaction tests it wont help his self respect any he looked at dave thoughtfully and then at the field test outline given in the handbook he said see here dave what about sitting through a test it would be the wise thing to do the robot rose if you say so boss there was pain in his voice it started simply enough robot dv multiplied five place figures to the heartless ticking of a stop watch he recited the prime numbers between a thousand and ten thousand he extracted cube roots and integrated functions of varying complexity he went through mechanical reactions in order of increasing difficulty and finally worked his precise mechanical mind over the highest function of the robot world the solutions of problems in judgment and ethics at the end of two hours powell was copiously besweated donovan had enjoyed a none too nutritious diet of fingernail and the robot said how does it look boss powell said ive got to think it over dave snap judgments wont help much suppose you go back to the c shift take it easy dont press too hard for quota just for a while and well fix things up the robot left donovan looked at powell well powell seemed determined to push up his mustache by the roots he said there is nothing wrong with the currents of his positronic brain id hate to be that certain oh jupiter mike the brain is the surest part of a robot its quintuple checked back on earth if they pass the field test perfectly the way dave did there just isnt a chance of brain misfunction that test covered every key path in the brain so where are we dont rush me let me work this out theres still the possibility of a mechanical breakdown in the body that leaves about fifteen hundred condensers twenty thousand individual electric circuits five hundred vacuum cells a thousand relays and upty ump thousand other individual pieces of complexity that can be wrong and these mysterious positron is fields no one knows anything about listen greg donovan grew desperately urgent ive got an idea that robot may be lying he never robots cant knowingly lie you fool now if we had the mccormack wesley tester we could check each individual item in his body within twenty four to forty eight hours but the only two m w testers existing are on earth and they weigh ten tons are on concrete foundations and cant be moved isnt that peachy donovan pounded the desk but greg he only goes wrong when were not around theres something sinister about that he punctuated the sentence with slams of fist against desk you said powell slowly make me sick youve been reading adventure novels what i want to know shouted donovan is what were going to do about it ill tell you im going to install a visiplate right over my desk right on the wall over there see he jabbed a vicious finger at the spot then im going to focus it at whatever part of the mine is being worked and im going to watch thats all thats all greg powell rose from his chair and leaned his balled fists on the desk mike im having a hard time his voice was weary for a week youve been plaguing me about dave you say hes gone wrong do you know how hes gone wrong not do you know what shape this wrongness takes no do you know what brings it on no do you know what snaps him out not do you know anything about it no do i know anything about it no so what do you want me to do donovans arm swept outward in a vague grandiose gesture you got me so i tell you again before we do anything toward a cure weve got to find out what the disease is in the first place the first step in cooking rabbit stew is catching the rabbit well weve got to catch that rabbit now get out of here donovan stared at the preliminary outline of his field report with weary eyes for one thing he was tired and for another what was there to report while things were unsettled he felt resentful he said greg were almost a thousand tons behind schedule you replied powell never looking up are telling me something i dont know what i want to know said donovan in sudden savagery is why were always tangled up with new type robots ive finally decided that the robots that were good enough for my great uncle on my mothers side are good enough for me im for whats tried and true the test of time is what counts good solid old fashioned robots that never go wrong powell threw a book with perfect aim and donovan went tumbling off his seat your job said powell evenly for the last five years has been to test new robots under actual working conditions for united states robots because you and i have been so injudicious as to display proficiency at the task weve been rewarded with the dirtiest jobs that he jabbed holes in the air with his finger in donovans direction is your work youve been griping about it from personal memory since about five minutes after united states robots signed you up why dont you resign well ill tell you donovan rolled onto his stomach and took a firm grip on his wild red hair to hold his head up theres a certain principle involved after all as a trouble shooter ive played a part in the development of new robots theres the principle of aiding scientific advance but dont get me wrong its not the principle that keeps me going its the money they pay us greg powell jumped at donovans wild shout and his eyes followed the redheads to the visiplate when they goggled in fixed horror he whispered holy howling jupiter donovan scrambled breathlessly to his feet look at them greg theyve gone nuts powell said get a pair of suits were going out there he watched the posturings of the robots on the visiplate they were bronzy gleams of smooth motion against the shadowy crags of the airless asteroid there was a marching formation now and in their own dim body light the roughhewn walls of the mine tunnel swam past noiselessly checkered with misty erratic blobs of shadow they marched in unison seven of them with dave at the head they wheeled and turned in macabre simultaneity and melted through changes of formation with the weird ease of chorus dancers in lunar bowl donovan was back with the suits theyve gone jingo on us greg thats a military march for all you know was the cold response it may be a series of calisthenic exercises or dave may be under the hallucination of being a dancing master just you think first and dont bother to speak afterward either donovan scowled and slipped a detonator into the empty side holster with an ostentatious shove he said anyway there you are so we work with new model robots its our job granted but answer me one question why why does something invariably go wrong with them because said powell somberly we are accursed lets go far ahead through the thick velvety blackness of the corridors that reached past the illuminated circles of their flashlights robot light twinkled there they are breathed donovan powell whispered tensely ive been trying to get him by radio but he doesnt answer the radio circuit is probably out then im glad the designers havent worked out robots who can work in total darkness yet id hate to have to find seven mad robots in a black pit without radio communication if they werent lit up like blasted radioactive christmas trees crawl up on the ledge above mike theyre coming this way and i want to watch them at close range can you make it donovan made the jump with a grunt gravity was considerably below earth normal but with a heavy suit the advantage was not too great and the ledge meant a near ten foot jump powell followed the column of robots was trailing dave single file in mechanical rhythm they converted to double and returned to single in different order it was repeated over and over again and dave never turned his head dave was within twenty feet when the play acting ceased the subsidiary robots broke formation waited a moment then clattered off into the distance very rapidly dave looked after them then slowly sat down he rested his head in one hand in a very human gesture his voice sounded in powells earphones are you here boss powell beckoned to donovan and hopped off the ledge o k dave whats been going on the robot shook his head i dont know one moment i was handling a tough outcropping in tunnel and the next i was aware of humans close by and i found myself half a mile down main stem where are the subsidiaries now asked donovan back at work of course how much time has been lost not much forget it then to donovan powell added stay with him the rest of the shift then come back ive got a couple of ideas it was three hours before donovan returned he looked tired powell said how did it go donovan shrugged wearily nothing ever goes wrong when you watch them throw me a butt will you the redhead lit it with exaggerated care and blew a careful smoke ring he said ive been working it out greg you know dave has a queer background for a robot there are six others under him in an extreme regimentation hes got life and death power over those subsidiary robots and it must react on his mentality suppose he finds it necessary to emphasize this power as a concession to his ego get to the point its right here suppose we have militarism suppose hes fashioning himself an army suppose hes training them in military maneuvers suppose suppose you go soak your head your nightmares must be in technicolor youre postulating a major aberration of the positronic brain if your analysis were correct dave would have to break down the first law of robotics that a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to be injured the type of militaristic attitude and domineering ego you propose must have as the end point of its logical implications domination of humans all right how do you know that isnt the fact of the matter because any robot with a brain like that would one never have left the factory and two be spotted immediately if it ever was i tested dave you know powell shoved his chair back and put his feet on the desk no were still in the position where we cant make our stew because we havent the slightest notion as to whats wrong for instance if we could find out what that dance macabre we witnessed was all about we would be on the way out he paused now listen mike how does this sound to you dave goes wrong only when neither of us is present and when he is wrong the arrival of either of us snaps him out of it i once told you that was sinister dont interrupt how is a robot different when humans are not present the answer is obvious there is a larger requirement of personal initiative in that case look for the body parts that are affected by the new requirements golly donovan sat up straight then subsided no no not enough its too broad it doesnt cut tie possibilities much cant help that in any case theres no danger of not making quota well take shifts watching those robots through the visor any time anything goes wrong we get to the scene of action immediately that will put them right but the robots will fail spec anyway greg united states robots cant market dv models with a report like that obviously weve got to locate the error in make up and correct it and weve got ten days to do it in powell scratched his head the trouble is well you had better look at the blueprints yourself the blueprints covered the floor like a carpet and donovan crawled over the face of them following powells erratic pencil powell said heres where you come in mike youre the body specialist and i want you to check me ive been trying to cut out all circuits not involved in the personal initiative hookup right here for instance is the trunk artery involving mechanical operations i cut out all routine side routes as emergency divisions he looked up what do you think donovan had a very bad taste in his mouth the jobs not that simple greg personal initiative isnt an electric circuit you can separate from the rest and study when a robot is on his own the intensity of the body activity increases immediately on almost all fronts there isnt a circuit entirely unafected what must be done is to locate the particular condition a very specific condition that throws him off and then start eliminating circuits powell got up and dusted himself hmph all right take away the blueprints and burn them donovan said you see when activity intensifies anything can happen given one single faulty part insulation breaks down a condenser spills over a connection sparks a coil overheats and if you work blind with the whole robot to choose from youll never find the bad spot if you take dave apart and test every point of his body mechanism one by one putting him together each time and trying him out all right all right i can see through a porthole too they faced each other hopelessly and then powell said cautiously suppose we interview one of the subsidiaries neither powell nor donovan had ever had previous occasion to talk to a finger it could talk it wasnt quite the perfect analogy to a human finger in fact it had a fairly developed brain but that brain was tuned primarily to the reception of orders via positronic field and its reaction to independent stimuli was rather fumbling nor was powell certain as to its name its serial number was dv but that was not very useful he compromised look pal he said im going to ask you to do some hard thinking and then you can go back to your boss the finger nodded its head stiffly but did not exert its limited brainpower on speech now on four occasions recently powell said your boss deviated from brain scheme do you remember those occasions yes sir donovan growled angrily he remembers i tell you there is something very sinister oh go bash your skull of course the finger remembers there is nothing wrong with him powell turned back to the robot what were you doing each time i mean the whole group the finger had a curious air of reciting by rote as if he answered questions by the mechanical pressure of his brain pan but without any enthusiasm whatever he said the first time we were at work on a difficult outcropping in tunnel level b the second time we were buttressing the roof against a possible cave in the third time we were preparing accurate blasts in order to tunnel farther without breaking into a subterranean fissure the fourth time was just after a minor cave in what happened at these times it is difficult to describe an order would be issued but before we could receive and interpret it a new order came to march in queer formation powell snapped out why i dont know donovan broke in tensely what was the first order the one that was superseded by the marching directions i dont know i sensed that an order was sent but there was never time to receive it could you tell us anything about it was it the same order each time the finger shook his head unhappily i dont know powell leaned back all right get back to your boss the finger left with visible relief donovan said well we accomplished a lot that time that was real sharp dialogue all the way through listen dave and that imbecile finger are both holding out on us there is too much they dont know and dont remember weve got to stop trusting them greg powell brushed his mustache the wrong way so help me mike another fool remark out of you and ill take away your rattle and teething ring all right youre the genius of the team im just a poor sucker where do we stand right behind the eight ball i tried to work it backward through the finger and couldnt so weve got to work it forward a great man marveled donovan how simple that makes it now translate that into english master translating it into baby talk would suit you better i mean that weve got to find out what order it is that dave gives just before everything goes black it would be the key to the business and how do you expect to do that we cant get close to him because nothing will go wrong as long as we are there we cant catch the orders by radio because they are transmitted via this positronic field that eliminates the closerange and the long range method leaving us a neat cozy zero by direct observation yes theres still deduction huh were going on shifts mike powell smiled grimly and we are not taking our eyes off the visiplate were going to watch every action of those steel headaches when they go off into their act were going to see what happened immediately before and were going to deduce the order donovan opened his mouth and left it that way for a full minute then he said in strangled tones i resign i quit you have ten days to think up something better said powell wearily which for eight days donovan tried mightily to do for eight days on alternate four hour shifts he watched with aching and bleary eyes those glinty metallic forms move against the vague background and for eight days in the four hour in betweens he cursed united states robots the dv models and the day he was born and then on the eighth day when powell entered with an aching head and sleepy eyes for his shift donovan stood up and with very careful and deliberate aim launched a heavy book end for the exact center of the visiplate there was a very appropriate splintering noise powell gasped what did you do that for because said donovan almost calmly im not watching it any more weve got two days left and we havent found out a thing dv is a lousy loss hes stopped five times since ive been watching and three times on your shift and i cant make out what orders he gave and you couldnt make it out and i dont believe you could ever make it out because i know i couldnt ever jumping space how can you watch six robots at the same time one makes with the hands and one with the feet and one like a windmill and another is jumping up and down like a maniac and the other two devil knows what they are doing and then they all stop so so greg were not doing it right we got to get up close weve got to watch what theyre doing from where we can see the details powell broke a bitter silence yeah and wait for something to go wrong with onlv two davs to go is it any better watching from here its more comfortable ah but theres something you can do there that you cant do here whats that you can make them stop at whatever time you choose and while youre prepared and watching to see what goes wrong powell startled into alertness howzzat well figure it out yourself youre the brains you say ask yourself some questions when does dv go out of whack when did that finger say he did when a cave in threatened or actually occurred when delicately measured explosives were being laid down when a difficult seam was hit in other words during emergencies powell was excited right when did you expect it to happen its the personal initiative factor thats giving us the trouble and its just during emergencies in the absence of a human being that personal initiative is most strained now what is the logical deduction how can we create our own stoppage when and where we want it he paused triumphantly he was beginning to enjoy his role and answered his own question to forestall the obvious answer on powells tongue by creating our own emergency powell said mike youre right thanks pal i knew id do it some day all right and skip the sarcasm well save it for earth and preserve it in jars for future long cold winters meanwhile what emergency can we create we could flood the mines if this werent an airless asteroid a witticism no doubt said powell really mike youll incapacitate me with laughter what about a mild cave in donovan pursed his lips and said o k by me good lets get started powell felt uncommonly like a conspirator as he wound his way over the craggy landscape his sub gravity walk teetered across the broken ground kicking rocks to right and left under his weight in noiseless puffs of gray dust mentally though it was the cautious crawl of the plotter he said do you know where they are i think so greg all right powell said gloomily but if any finger gets within twenty feet of us well be sensed whether we are in the line of sight or not i hope you know that when i need an elementary course in robotics ill file an application with you formally and in triplicate down through here they were in the tunnels now even the starlight was gone the two hugged the walls flashes flickering out the way in intermittent bursts powell felt for the security of his detonator do you know this tunnel mike not so good its a new one i think i can make it out from what i saw in the visiplate though interminable minutes passed and then mike said feel that there was a slight vibration thrumming the wall against the fingers of powells metal incased hand there was no sound naturally blasting were pretty close keep your eyes open said powell donovan nodded impatiently it was upon them and gone before they could seize themselves just a bronze glint across the field of vision they clung together in silence powell whispered think it sensed us hope not but wed better flank them take the first side tunnel to the right suppose we miss them altogether well what do you want to do go back donovan grunted fiercely theyre within a quarter of a mile i was watching them through the visiplate wasnt i and weve got two days oh shut up youre wasting your oxygen is this a side passage here the flash flicked it is lets go the vibration was considerably more marked and the ground below shuddered uneasily this is good said donovan if it doesnt give out on us though he flung his light ahead anxiously they could touch the roof of the tunnel with a halfupstretched hand and the bracings had been newly placed donovan hesitated dead end lets go back no hold on powell squeezed clumsily past is that light ahead light i dont see any where would there be light down here robot light he was scrambling up a gentle incline on hands and knees his voice was hoarse and anxious in donovans ears hey mike come up here there was light donovan crawled up and over powells outstretched legs an opening yes they must be working into this tunnel from the other side now i think donovan felt the ragged edges of the opening that looked out into what the cautious flashlight showed to be a larger and obviously mainstem tunnel the hole was too small for a man to go through almost too small for two men to look through simultaneously theres nothing there said donovan well not now but there must have been a second ago or we wouldnt have seen light watch out the walls rolled about them and they felt the impact a fine dust showered down powell lifted a cautious head and looked again all right mike theyre there the glittering robots clustered fifty feet down the main stem metal arms labored mightily at the rubbish heap brought down by the last blast donovan urged eagerly dont waste time it wont be long before they get through and the next blast may get us for petes sake dont rush me powell unlimbered the detonator and his eyes searched anxiously across the dusky background where the only light was robot light and it was impossible to tell a projecting boulder from a shadow theres a spot in the roof see it almost over them the last blast didnt quite get it if you can get it at the base half the roof will cave in powell followed the dim finger check now fasten your eye on the robots and pray they dont move too far from that part of the tunnel theyre my light sources are all seven there donovan counted all seven well then watch them watch every motion his detonator was lifted and remained poised while donovan watched and cursed and blinked the sweat out of his eye it flashed there was a jar a series of hard vibrations and then a jarring thump that threw powell heavily against donovan donovan yowled greg you threw me off i didnt see a thing powell stared about wildly where are they donovan fell into a stupid silence there was no sign of the robots it was dark as the depths of the river styx think we buried them quavered donovan lets get down there dont ask me what i think powell crawled backward at tumbling speed mike donovan paused in the act of following whats wrong now hold on powells breathing was rough and irregular in donovans ears mike do you hear me mike im right here what is it were blocked in it wasnt the ceiling coming down fifty feet away that knocked us over it was our own ceiling the shocks tumbled it what donovan scrambled up against a hard barrier turn on the flash powell did so at no point was there room for a rabbit to squeeze through donovan said softly well what do you know they wasted a few moments and some muscular power in an effort to move the blocking barrier powell varied this by wrenching at the edges of the original hole for a moment powell lifted his blaster but in those close quarters a flash would be suicide and he knew it he sat down you know mike he said weve really messed this up we are no nearer finding out whats wrong with dave it was a good idea but it blew up in our face donovans glance was bitter with an intensity totally wasted on the darkness i hate to disturb you old man but quite apart from what we know or dont know of dave were slightly trapped if we dont get loose fella were going to die d i e die how much oxygen have we anyway not more than six hours ive thought of that powells fingers went up to his long suffering mustache and clanged uselessly against the transparent visor of course we could get dave to dig us out easily in that time except that our precious emergency must have thrown him off and his radio circuit is out and isnt that nice donovan edged up to the opening and managed to get his metalincased head out it was an extremely tight fit hey greg what suppose we get dave within twenty feet hell snap to normal that will save us sure but where is he down the corridor way down for petes sake stop pulling before you drag my head out of its socket ill give you your chance to look powell maneuvered his head outside we did it all right look at those saps that must be a ballet theyre doing never mind the side remarks are they getting any closer cant tell yet theyre too far away give me a chance pass me my flash will you ill try to attract their attention that way he gave up after two minutes not a chance they must be blind uhoh theyre starting toward us what do you know donovan said hey let me see there was a silent scuffle powell said all right and donovan got his head out they were approaching dave was high stepping the way in front and the six fingers were a weaving chorus line behind him donovan marveled what are they doing thats what i want to know it looks like the virginia reel and daves a major domo or i never saw one oh leave me alone with your descriptions grumbled powell how near are they within fifty feet and coming this way well be out in fifteen minuh huh huh hey y whats going on it took powell several seconds to recover from his stunned astonishment at donovans vocal gyrations come on give me a chance at that hole dont be a hog about it he fought his way upward but donovan kicked wildly they did an about face greg theyre leaving davel hey da a ave powell shrieked whats the use of that you fool sound wont carry well then panted donovan kick the walls slam them get some vibration started weve got to attract their attention somehow greg or were through he pounded like a madman powell shook him wait mike wait listen ive got an idea jumping jupiter this is a fine time to get around to the simple solutions mike what do you want donovan pulled his head in let me in there fast before they get out of range out of range what are you going to do hey what are you going to do with that detonator he grabbed powells arm powell shook off the grip violently im going to do a little shooting why thats for later lets see if it works first if it doesnt then get out of the way and let me shoot the robots were flickers small and getting smaller in the distance powell lined up the sights tensely and pulled the trigger three times he lowered the guns and peered anxiously one of the subsidiaries was down there were only six gleaming figures now powell called into his transmitter uncertainly dave a pause then the answer sounded to both men boss where are you my third subsidiary has had his chest blown in hes out of commission never mind your subsidiary said powell were trapped in a cave in where you were blasting can you see our flashlight sure well be right there powell sat back and relaxed that my fran is that donovan said very softly with tears in his voice all right greg you win i beat my forehead against the ground before your feet now dont feed me any bull just tell me quietly what its all about easy its just that all through we missed the obvious as usual we knew it was the personal initiative circuit and that it always happened during emergencies but we kept looking for a specific order as the cause why should it be an order why not well look why not a type of order what type of order requires the most initiative what type of order would occur almost always only in an emergency dont ask me dreg tell me im doing it its the six way order under all ordinary conditions one or more of the fingers would be doing routine tasks requiring no close supervision in the sort of offhand way our bodies handle the routine walking motions but in an emergency all six subsidiaries must be mobilized immediately and simultaneously dave must handle six robots at a time and something gives the rest was easy any decrease in initiative required such as the arrival of humans snaps him back so i destroyed one of the robots when i did he was transmitting only five way orders initiative decreases hes normal how did you get all that demanded donovan just logical guessing i tried it and it worked the robots voice was in their ears again here i am can you hold out half an hour easy said powell then to donovan he continued and now the job should be simple well go through the circuits and check off each part that gets an extra workout in a six way order as against a five way how big a field does that leave us donovan considered not much i think if dave is like the preliminary model we saw back at the factory theres a special coordinating circuit that would be the only section involved he cheered up suddenly and amazingly say that wouldnt be bad at all theres nothing to that all right you think it over and well check the blueprints when we get back and now till daves reaches us im relaxing hey wait just tell me one thing what were those queer shifting marches those funny dance steps that the robots went through every time they went screwy that i dont know but ive got a notion remember those subsidiaries were daves fingers we were always saying that you know well its my idea that in all these interludes whenever dave became a psychiatric case he went off into a moronic maze spending his time twiddling his fingers susan calvin talked about powell and donovan with unsmiling amusement but warmth came into her voice when she mentioned robots it didnt take her long to go through the speedies the cuties and the daves and i stopped her otherwise she would have dredged up half a dozen more i said doesnt anything ever happen on earth she looked at me with a little frown no we dont have much to do with robots in action here on earth oh well thats too bad i mean your field engineers are swell but cant we get you into this didnt you ever have a robot go wrong on you its your anniversary you know and so help me she blushed she said robots have gone wrong on me heavens how long its been since i thought of it why it was almost forty years ago certainlyl and i was only thirty eight oh my id rather not talk about it i waited and sure enough she changed her mind why not she said it cannot harm me now even the memory cant i was foolish once young man would you believe that no i said i was but herbie was a mind reading robot what only one of its kind before or since a mistake somewheres liar alfred lanning lit his cigar carefully but the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly his gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs it reads minds all right damn little doubt about that but why he looked at mathematician peter bogert well bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands that was the thirty fourth rb model weve turned out lanning all the others were strictly orthodox the third man at the table frowned milton ashe was the youngest officer of u s robot amp mechanical men inc and proud of his post listen bogert there wasnt a hitch in the assembly from start to finish i guarantee that bogerts thick lips spread in a patronizing smile do you if you can answer for the entire assembly line i recommend your promotion by exact count there are seventy five thousand two hundred and thirtyfour operations necessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain each separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors from five to a hundred and five if any one of them goes seriously wrong the brain is ruined i quote our own information folder ashe milton ashe flushed but a fourth voice cut off his reply if were going to start by trying to fix the blame on one another im leaving susan calvins hands were folded tightly in her lap and the little lines about her thin pale lips deepened weve got a mind reading robot on our hands and it strikes me as rather important that we find out just why it reads minds were not going to do that by saying your fault my fault her cold gray eyes fastened upon ashe and he grinned lanning grinned too and as always at such times his long white hair and shrewd little eyes made him the picture of a biblical patriarch true for you dr calvin his voice became suddenly crisp heres everything in pill concentrate form weve produced a positronic brain of supposedly ordinary vintage thats got the remarkable property of being able to tune in on thought waves it would mark the most important advance in robotics in decades if we knew how it happened we dont and we have to find out is that clear may i make a suggestion asked bogert go ahead id say that until we do figure out the mess and as a mathematician i expect it to be a very devil of a mess we keep the existence of rd a secret i mean even from the other members of the staff as heads of the departments we ought not to find it an insoluble problem and the fewer know about it bogert is right said dr calvin ever since the interplanetary code was modified to allow robot models to be tested in the plants before being shipped out to space antirobot propaganda has increased if any word leaks out about a robot being able to read minds before we can announce complete control of the phenomenon pretty effective capital could be made out of it lanning sucked at his cigar and nodded gravely he turned to ashe i think you said you were alone when you first stumbled on this thought reading business ill say i was alone i got the scare of my life rb had just been taken off the assembly table and they sent him down to me obermann was off somewheres so i took him down to the testing rooms myself at least i started to take him down ashe paused and a tiny smile tugged at his lips say did any of you ever carry on a thought conversation without knowing it no one bothered to answer and he continued you dont realize it at first you know he just spoke to me as logically and sensibly as you can imagine and it was only when i was most of the way down to the testing rooms that i realized that i hadnt said anything sure i thought lots but that isnt the same thing is it i locked that thing up and ran for lanning having it walking beside me calmly peering into my thoughts and picking and choosing among them gave me the willies i imagine it would said susan calvin thoughtfully her eyes fixed themselves upon ashe in an oddly intent manner we are so accustomed to considering our own thoughts private lanning broke in impatiently then only the four of us know all right weve got to go about this systematically ashe i want you to check over the assembly line from beginning to end everything youre to eliminate all operations in which there was no possible chance of an error and list all those where there were together with its nature and possible magnitude tall order grunted ashe naturally of course youre to put the men under you to work on this every single one if you have to and i dont care if we go behind schedule either but theyre not to know why you understand hm m m yes the young technician grinned wryly its still a lulu of a job lanning swiveled about in his chair and faced calvin youll have to tackle the job from the other direction youre the robo psychologist of the plant so youre to study the robot itself and work backward try to find out how he ticks see what else is tied up with his telepathic powers how far they extend how they warp his outlook and just exactly what harm it has done to his ordinary rb properties youve got that lanning didnt wait for dr calvin to answer ill co ordinate the work and interpret the findings mathematically he puffed violently at his cigar and mumbled the rest through the smoke bogert will help me there of course bogert polished the nails of one pudgy hand with the other and said blandly i dare say i know a little in the line well ill get started ashe shoved his chair back and rose his pleasantly youthful face crinkled in a grin ive got the darnedest job of any of us so im getting out of here and to work he left with a slurred b seein ye susan calvin answered with a barely perceptible nod but her eyes followed him out of sight and she did not answer when lanning grunted and said do you want to go up and see rb now dr calvin rb s photoelectric eyes lifted from the book at the muffled sound of binges turning and he was upon his feet when susan calvin entered she paused to readjust the huge no entrance sign upon the door and then approached the robot ive brought you the texts upon hyperatomic motors herbie a few anyway would you care to look at them rb otherwise known as herbie lifted the three heavy books from her arms and opened to the title page of one hm m m theory of hyperatomics he mumbled inarticulately to himself as he flipped the pages and then spoke with an abstracted air sit down dr calvin this will take me a few minutes the psychologist seated herself and watched herbie narrowly as he took a chair at the other side of the table and went through the three books systematically at the end of half an hour he put them down of course i know why you brought these the corner of dr calvins lip twitched i was afraid you would its difficult to work with you herbie youre always a step ahead of me its the same with these books you know as with the others they just dont interest me theres nothing to your textbooks your science is just a mass of collected data plastered together by make shift theory and all so incredibly simple that its scarcely worth bothering about its your fiction that interests me your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotions his mighty hand gestured vaguely as he sought the proper words dr calvin whispered i think i understand i see into minds you see the robot continued and you have no idea how complicated they are i cant begin to understand everything because my own mind has so little in common with them but i try and your novels help yes but im afraid that after going through some of the harrowing emotional experiences of our present day sentimental novel there was a tinge of bitterness in her voice you find real minds like ours dull and colorless but i dont the sudden energy in the response brought the other to her feet she felt herself reddening and thought wildly he must know herbie subsided suddenly and muttered in a low voice from which the metallic timbre departed almost entirely but of course i know about it dr calvin you think of it always so how can i help but know her face was hard have you told anyone of course not this with genuine surprise no one has asked me well then she flung out i suppose you think i am a fool no it is a normal emotion perhaps that is why it is so foolish the wistfulness in her voice drowned out everything else some of the woman peered through the layer of doctorhood i am not what you would call attractive if you are referring to mere physical attraction i couldnt judge but i know in any case that there are other types of attraction nor young dr calvin had scarcely heard the robot you are not yet forty an anxious insistence had crept into herbies voice thirty eight as you count the years a shriveled sixty as far as my emotional outlook on life is concerned am i a psychologist for nothing she drove on with bitter breathlessness and hes barely thirty five and looks and acts younger do you suppose he ever sees me as anything but but what i am you are wrong herbies steel fist struck the plastictopped table with a strident clang listen to me but susan calvin whirled on him now and the hunted pain in her eyes became a blaze why should i what do you know about it all anyway you you machine im just a specimen to you an interesting bug with a peculiar mind spread eagled for inspection its a wonderful example of frustration isnt it almost as good as your books her voice emerging in dry sobs choked into silence the robot cowered at the outburst he shook his head pleadingly wont you listen to me please i could help you if you would let me how her lips curled by giving me good advice no not that its just that i know what other people think milton ashe for instance there was a long silence and susan calvins eyes dropped i dont want to know what he thinks she gasped keep quiet i think you would want to know what he thinks her head remained bent but her breath came more quickly you are talking nonsense she whispered why should i i am trying to help milton ashes thoughts of you he paused and then the psychologist raised her head well the robot said quietly he loves you for a full minute dr calvin did not speak she merely stared then you are mistaken you must be why should he but he does a thing like that cannot be hidden not from me but i am so so she stammered to a halt he looks deeper than the skin and admires intellect in others milton ashe is not the type to marry a head of hair and a pair of eyes susan calvin found herself blinking rapidly and waited before speaking even then her voice trembled yet he certainly never in any way indicated have you ever given him a chance how could i i never thought that exactly the psychologist paused in thought and then looked up suddenly a girl visited him here at the plant half a year ago she was pretty i suppose blond and slim and of course could scarcely add two and two he spent all day puffing out his chest trying to explain how a robot was put together the hardness had returned not that she understood who was she herbie answered without hesitation i know the person you are referring to she is his first cousin and there is no romantic interest there i assure you susan calvin rose to her feet with a vivacity almost girlish now isnt that strange thats exactly what i used to pretend to myself sometimes though i never really thought so then it all must be true she ran to herbie and seized his cold heavy hand in both hers thank you herbie her voice was an urgent husky whisper dont tell anyone about this let it be our secret and thank you again with that and a convulsive squeeze of herbies unresponsive metal fingers she left herbie turned slowly to his neglected novel but there was no one to read his thoughts milton ashe stretched slowly and magnificently to the tune of cracking joints and a chorus of grunts and then glared at peter bogert ph d say he said ive been at this for a week now with just about no sleep how long do i have to keep it up i thought you said the positronic bombardment in vac chamber d was the solution bogert yawned delicately and regarded his white hands with interest it is im on the track i know what that means when a mathematician says it how near the end are you it all depends on what ashe dropped into a chair and stretched his long legs out before him on lanning the old fellow disagrees with me he sighed a bit behind the times thats the trouble with him he clings to matrix mechanics as the all in all and this problem calls for more powerful mathematical tools hes so stubborn ashe muttered sleepily why not ask herbie and settle the whole affair ask the robot bogerts eyebrows climbed why not didnt the old girl tell you you mean calvin yeah susie herself that robots a mathematical wiz he knows all about everything plus a bit on the side he does triple integrals in his head and eats up tensor analysis for dessert the mathematician stared skeptically are you serious so help me the catch is that the dope doesnt like math he would rather read slushy novels honest you should see the tripe susie keeps feeding him purple passion and love in space dr calvin hasnt said a word of this to us well she hasnt finished studying him you know how she is she likes to have everything just so before letting out the big secret shes told you we sort of got to talking i have been seeing a lot of her lately he opened his eyes wide and frowned say bogie have you been noticing anything queer about the lady lately bogert relaxed into an undignified grin shes using lipstick if thats what you mean hell i know that rouge powder and eye shadow too shes a sight but its not that i cant put my finger on it its the way she talks as if she were happy about something he thought a little and then shrugged the other allowed himself a leer which for a scientist past fifty was not a bad job maybe shes in love ashe allowed his eyes to close again youre nuts bogie you go speak to herbie i want to stay here and go to sleep right not that i particularly like having a robot tell me my job nor that i think he can do it a soft snore was his only answer herbie listened carefully as peter bogert hands in pockets spoke with elaborate indifference so there you are ive been told you understand these things and i am asking you more in curiosity than anything else my line of reasoning as i have outlined it involves a few doubtful steps i admit which dr lanning refuses to accept and the picture is still rather incomplete the robot didnt answer and bogert said well i see no mistake herbie studied the scribbled figures i dont suppose you can go any further than that i darent try you are a better mathematician than i and well id hate to commit myself there was a shade of complacency in bogerts smile i rather thought that would be the case it is deep well forget it he crumpled the sheets tossed them down the waste shaft turned to leave and then thought better of it by the way the robot waited bogert seemed to have difficulty there is something that is perhaps you can he stopped herbie spoke quietly your thoughts are confused but there is no doubt at all that they concern dr lanning it is silly to hesitate for as soon as you compose yourself ill know what it is you want to ask the mathematicians hand went to his sleek hair in the familiar smoothing gesture lanning is nudging seventy he said as if that explained everything i know that and hes been director of the plant for almost thirty years herbie nodded well now bogerts voice became ingratiating you would know whether whether hes thinking of resigning health perhaps or some other quite said herbie and that was all well do you know certainly then uh could you tell me since you ask yes the robot was quite matter of fact about it he has already resigned what the exclamation was an explosive almost inarticulate sound the scientists large head hunched forward say that again he has already resigned came the quiet repetition but it has not yet taken effect he is waiting you see to solve the problem of er myself that finished he is quite ready to turn the office of director over to his successor bogert expelled his breath sharply and this successor who is he he was quite close to herbie now eyes fixed fascinatedly on those unreadable dull red photoelectric cells that were the robots eyes words came slowly you are the next director and bogert relaxed into a tight smile this is good to know ive been hoping and waiting for this thanks herbie peter bogert was at his desk until five that morning and he was back at nine the shelf just over the desk emptied of its row of reference books and tables as he referred to one after the other the pages of calculations before him increased microscopically and the crumpled sheets at his feet mounted into a hill of scribbled paper at precisely noon he stared at the final page rubbed a blood shot eye yawned and shrugged this is getting worse each minute damn he turned at the sound of the opening door and nodded at lanning who entered cracking the knuckles of one gnarled hand with the other the director took in the disorder of the room and his eyebrows furrowed together new lead he asked no came the defiant answer whats wrong with the old one lanning did not trouble to answer nor to do more than bestow a single cursory glance at the top sheet upon bogerts desk he spoke through the flare of a match as he lit a cigar has calvin told you about the robot its a mathematical genius really remarkable the other snorted loudly so ive heard but calvin had better stick to robopsychology ive checked herbie on math and he can scarcely struggle through calculus calvin didnt find it so shes crazy and i dont find it so the directors eyes narrowed dangerously you bogerts voice hardened what are you talking about ive been putting herbie through his paces all morning and he can do tricks you never heard of is that so you sound skeptical lanning flipped a sheet of paper out of his vest pocket and unfolded it thats not my handwriting is it bogert studied the large angular notation covering the sheet herbie did this right and if youll notice hes been working on your time integration of equation it comes lanning tapped a yellow fingernail upon the last step to the identical conclusion i did and in a quarter the time you had no right to neglect the linger effect in positronic bombardment i didnt neglect it for heavens sake lanning get it through your head that it would cancel out oh sure you explained that you used the mitchell translation equation didnt you well it doesnt apply why not because youve been using hyper imaginaries for one thing whats that to do with mitchells equation wont hold when are you crazy if youll reread mitchells original paper in the transactions of the far i dont have to i told you in the beginning that i didnt like his reasoning and herbie backs me in that well then bogert shouted let that clockwork contraption solve the entire problem for you why bother with nonessentials thats exactly the point herbie cant solve the problem and if he cant we cant alone im submitting the entire question to the national board its gotten beyond us bogerts chair went over backward as he jumped up a snarl face crimson youre doing nothing of the sort lanning flushed in his turn are you telling me what i cant do exactly was the gritted response ive got the problem beaten and youre not to take it out of my hands understand dont think i dont see through you you desiccated fossil youd cut your own nose off before youd let me get the credit for solving robotic telepathy youre a damned idiot bogert and in one second ill have you suspended for insubordination lannings lower lip trembled with passion which is one thing you wont do lanning you havent any secrets with a mind reading robot around so dont forget that i know all about your resignation the ash on lannings cigar trembled and fell and the cigar itself followed what what bogert chuckled nastily and im the new director be it understood im very aware of that dont think im not damn your eyes lanning im going to give the orders about here or there will be the sweetest mess that youve ever been in lanning found his voice and let it out with a roar youre suspended dye hear youre relieved of all duties youre broken do you understand the smile on the others face broadened now whats the use of that youre getting nowhere im holding the trumps i know youve resigned herbie told me and he got it straight from you lanning forced himself to speak quietly he looked an old old man with tired eyes peering from a face in which the red had disappeared leaving the pasty yellow of age behind i want to speak to herbie he cant have told you anything of the sort youre playing a deep game bogert but im calling your bluff come with me bogert shrugged to see herbie good damned good it was also precisely at noon that milton ashe looked up from his clumsy sketch and said you get the idea im not too good at getting this down but thats about how it looks its a honey of a house and i can get it for next to nothing susan calvin gazed across at him with melting eyes its really beautiful she sighed ive often thought that id like to her voice trailed away of course ashe continued briskly putting away his pencil ive got to wait for my vacation its only two weeks off but this herbie business has evervthing up in the air his eyes dropped to his fingernails besides theres another point but its a secret then dont tell me oh id just as soon im just busting to tell someone and youre just about the best er confidante i could find here he grinned sheepishly susan calvins heart bounded but she did not trust herself to speak frankly ashe scraped his chair closer and lowered his voice into a confidential whisper the house isnt to be only for myself im getting married and then he jumped out of his seat whats the matter nothing the horrible spinning sensation had vanished but it was hard to get words out married you mean why sure about time isnt it you remember that girl who was here last summer thats she but you are sick you headache susan calvin motioned him away weakly ive ive been subject to them lately i want to to congratulate you of course im very glad the inexpertly applied rouge made a pair of nasty red splotches upon her chalk white face things had begun spinning again pardon me please the words were a mumble as she stumbled blindly out the door it had happened with the sudden catastrophe of a dream and with all the unreal horror of a dream but how could it be herbie had said and herbie knew he could see into minds she found herself leaning breathlessly against the door jamb staring into herbies metal face she must have climbed the two flights of stairs but she had no memory of it the distance had been covered in an instant as in a dream as in a dream and still herbies unblinking eyes stared into hers and their dull red seemed to expand into dimly shining nightmarish globes he was speaking and she felt the cold glass pressing against her lips she swallowed and shuddered into a pertain awareness of her surroundings still herbie spoke and there was agitation in his voice as if he were hurt and frightened and pleading the words were beginning to make sense this is a dream he was saying and you mustnt believe in it youll wake into the real world soon and laugh at yourself he loves you i tell you he does he does but not here not now this is an illusion susan calvin nodded her voice a whisper yes yes she was clutching herbies arm clinging to it repeating over and over it isnt true is it it isnt is it just how she came to her senses she never knew but it was like passing from a world of misty unreality to one of harsh sunlight she pushed him away from her pushed hard against that steely arm and her eyes were wide what are you trying to do her voice rose to a harsh scream what are you trying to do herbie backed away i want to help the psychologist stared help by telling me this is a dream by trying to push me into schizophrenia a hysterical tenseness seized her this is no dream i wish it were she drew her breath sharply wait why why i understand merciful heavens its so obvious there was horror in the robots voice i had to and i believed youl i never thought loud voices outside the door brought her to a halt she turned away fists clenching spasmodically and when bogert and lanning entered she was at the far window neither of the men paid her the slightest attention they approached herbie simultaneously lanning angry and impatient bogert coolly sardonic the director spoke first here now herbie listen to me the robot brought his eyes sharply down upon the aged director yes dr lanning have you discussed me with dr bogert no sir the answer came slowly and the smile on bogerts face flashed off whats that bogert shoved in ahead of his superior and straddled the ground before the robot repeat what you told me yesterday i said that herbie fell silent deep within him his metallic diaphragm vibrated in soft discords didnt you say he had resigned roared bogert answer me bogert raised his arm frantically but lanning pushed him aside are you trying to bully him into lying you heard him lanning he began to say yes and stopped get out of my way i want the truth out of him understandl ill ask him lanning turned to the robot all right herbie take it easy have i resigned herbie stared and lanning repeated anxiously have i resigned there was the faintest trace of a negative shake of the robots head a long wait produced nothing further the two men looked at each other and the hostility in their eyes was all but tangible what the devil blurted bogert has the robot gone mute cant you speak you monstrosity i can speak came the ready answer then answer the question didnt you tell me lanning had resigned hasnt he resigned and again there was nothing but dull silence until from the end of the room susan calvins laugh rang out suddenly high pitched and semi hysterical the two mathematicians jumped and bogerts eyes narrowed you here whats so funny nothings funny her voice was not quite natural its just that im not the only one thats been caught theres irony in three of the greatest experts in robotics in the world falling into the same elementary trap isnt there her voice faded and she put a pale hand to her forehead but it isnt funny this time the look that passed between the two men was one of raised eyebrows what trap are you talking about asked lansing stiffly is something wrong with herbie no she approached them slowly nothing is wrong with him only with us she whirled suddenly and shrieked at the robot get away from me go to the other end of the room and dont let me look at you herbie cringed before the fury of her eyes and stumbled away in a clattering trot lannings voice was hostile what is all this dr calvin she faced them and spoke sarcastically surely you know the fundamental first law of robotics the other two nodded together certainly said bogert irritably a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow him to come to harm how nicely put sneered calvin but what kind of harm why any kind exactly any kind but what about hurt feelings what about deflation of ones ego what about the blasting of ones hopes is that injury lanning frowned what would a robot know about and then he caught himself with a gasp youve caught on have you this robot reads minds do you suppose it doesnt know everything about mental injury do you suppose that if asked a question it wouldnt give exactly that answer that one wants to hear wouldnt any other answer hurt us and wouldnt herbie know that good heavens muttered bogert the psychologist cast a sardonic glance at him i take it you asked him whether lanning had resigned you wanted to hear that he had resigned and so thats what herbie told you and i suppose that is why said lanning tonelessly it would not answer a little while ago it couldnt answer either way without hurting one of us there was a short pause in which the men looked thoughtfully across the room at the robot crouching in the chair by the bookcase head resting in one hand susan calvin stared steadfastly at the floor he knew of all this that that devil knows everything including what went wrong in his assembly her eyes were dark and brooding lanning looked up youre wrong there dr calvin he doesnt know what went wrong i asked him what does that mean cried calvin only that you didnt want him to give you the solution it would puncture your ego to have a machine do what you couldnt did you ask him she shot at bogert in a way bogert coughed and reddened he told me he knew very little about mathematics lanning laughed not very loudly and the psychologist smiled caustically she said ill ask him a solution by him wont hurt my ego she raised her voice into a cold imperative come here herbie rose and approached with hesitant steps you know i suppose she continued just exactly at what point in the assembly an extraneous factor was introduced or an essential one left out yes said herbie in tones barely heard hold on broke in bogert angrily thats not necessary true you want to hear that thats all dont be a fool replied calvin he certainly knows as much math as you and lanning together since he can read minds give him his chance the mathematician subsided and calvin continued all right then herbie give were waiting and in an aside get pencils and paper gentlemen but herbie remained silent and there was triumph in the psychologists voice why dont you answer herbie the robot blurted out suddenly i cannot you know i cannot dr bogert and dr lanning dont want me to they want the solution but not from me lanning broke in speaking slowly and distinctly dont be foolish herbie we do want you to tell us bogert nodded curtly herbies voice rose to wild heights whats the use of saying that dont you suppose that i can see past the superficial skin of your mind down below you dont want me to im a machine given the imitation of life only by virtue of the positronic interplay in my brain which is mans device you cant lose face to me without being hurt that is deep in your mind and wont be erased i cant give the solution well leave said dr lanning tell calvin that would make no difference cried herbie since you would know anyway that it was i that was supplying the answer calvin resumed but you understand herbie that despite that drs lanning and bogert want that solution by their own efforts insisted herbie but they want it and the fact that you have it and wont give it hurts them you see that dont you yes yes and if you tell them that will hurt them too yes yes herbie was retreating slowly and step by step susan calvin advanced the two men watched in frozen bewilderment you cant tell them droned the psychologist slowly because that would hurt and you mustnt hurt but if you dont tell them you hurt so you must tell them and if you do you will hurt and you mustnt so you cant tell them but if you dont you hurt so you must but if you do you hurt so you mustnt but if you dont you hurt so you must but if you do you herbie was up against the wall and here he dropped to his knees stop he shrieked close your mind it is full of pain and frustration and hate i didnt mean it i tell you i tried to help i told you what you wanted to hear i had to the psychologist paid no attention you must tell them but if you do you hurt so you mustnt but if you dont you hurt so you must but and herbie screamed it was like the whistling of a piccolo many times magnified shrill and shriller till it keened with the terror of a lost soul and filled the room with the piercingness of itself and when it died into nothingness herbie collapsed into a huddled heap of motionless metal bogerts face was bloodless hes dead no susan calvin burst into body racking gusts of wild laughter not dead merely insane i confronted him with the insoluble dilemma and he broke down you can scrap him now because hell never speak again lanning was on his knees beside the thing that had been herbie his fingers touched the cold unresponsive metal face and he shuddered you did that on purpose he rose and faced her face contorted what if i did you cant help it now and in a sudden access of bitterness he deserved it the director seized the paralysed motionless bogert by the wrist whats the difference come peter he sighed a thinking robot of this type is worthless anyway his eyes were old and tired and he repeated come peter it was minutes after the two scientists left that dr susan calvin regained part of her mental equilibrium slowly her eyes turned to the living dead herbie and the tightness returned to her face long she stared while the triumph faded and the helpless frustration returned and of all her turbulent thoughts only one infinitely bitter word passed her lips liar that finished it for then naturally i knew i couldnt get any more out of her after that she just sat there behind her desk her white face cold and remembering i said thank you dr calvin but she didnt answer it was two days before i could get to see her again little lost robot when i did see susan calvin again it was at the door of her office files were being moved out she said how are your articles coming along young man fine i said i had put them into shape according to my own lights dramatized the bare bones of her recital added the conversation and little touches would you look over them and see if i havent been libellous or too unreasonably inaccurate anywhere i suppose so shall we retire to the executives lounge we can have coffee she seemed in good humor so i chanced it as we walked down the corridor i was wondering dr calvin yes if you would tell me more concerning the history of robotics surely you have what you want young man in a way but these incidents i have written up dont apply much to the modern world i mean there was only one mind reading robot ever developed and space stations are already outmoded and in disuse and robot mining is taken for granted what about interstellar travel its only been about twenty years since the hyperatomic motor was invented and its well known that it was a robotic invention what is the truth about it interstellar travel she was thoughtful we were in the lounge and i ordered a full dinner she just had coffee it wasnt a simple robotic invention you know not just like that but of course until we developed the brain we didnt get very far but we tried we really tried my first connection directly that is with interstellar research was in when a robot was lost measures on hyper base had been taken in a sort of rattling fury the muscular equivalent of an hysterical shriek to itemize them in order of both chronology and desperation they were all work on the hyperatomic drive through all the space volume occupied by the stations of the twenty seventh asteroidal grouping came to a halt that entire volume of space was nipped out of the system practically speaking no one entered without permission no one left under any conditions by special government patrol ship drs susan calvin and peter bogert respectively head psychologist and mathematical director of united states robot amp mechanical men corporation were brought to hyper base susan calvin had never left the surface of earth before and had no perceptible desire to leave it this time in an age of atomic power and a clearly coming hyperatomic drive she remained quietly provincial so she was dissatisfied with her trip and unconvinced of the emergency and every line of her plain middle aged face showed it clearly enough during her first dinner at hyper base nor did dr bogerts sleek paleness abandon a certain hangdog attitude nor did major general kallner who headed the project even once forget to maintain a hunted expression in short it was a grisly episode that meal and the little session of three that followed began in a gray unhappy manner kallner with his baldness glistening and his dress uniform oddly unsuited to the general mood began with uneasy directness this is a queer story to tell sir and madam i want to thank you for coming on short notice and without a reason being given well try to correct that now weve lost a robot work has stopped and must stop until such time as we locate it so far we have failed and we feel we need expert help perhaps the general felt his predicament anticlimactic he continued with a note of desperation i neednt tell you the importance of our work here more than eighty percent of last years appropriations for scientific research have gone to us why we know that said bogert agreeably u s robots is receiving a generous rental fee for use of our robots susan calvin injected a blunt vinegary note what makes a single robot so important to the project and why hasnt it been located the general turned his red face toward her and wet his lips quickly why in a manner of speaking we have located it then with near anguish here suppose i explain as soon as the robot failed to report a state of emergency was declared and all movement off hyper base stopped a cargo vessel had landed the previous day and had delivered us two robots for our laboratories it had sixty two robots of the uh game type for shipment elsewhere we are certain as to that figure there is no question about it whatever yes and the connection when our missing robot failed of location anywhere i assure you we would have found a missing blade of grass if it had been there to find we brainstormed ourselves into counting the robots left of the cargo ship they have sixty three now so that the sixty third i take it is the missing prodigal dr calvins eyes darkened yes but we have no way of telling which is the sixty third there was a dead silence while the electric clock chimed eleven times and then the robopsychologist said very peculiar and the corners of her lips moved downward peter she turned to her colleague with a trace of savagery whats wrong here what kind of robots are they using at hyper base dr bogert hesitated and smiled feebly its been rather a matter of delicacy till now susan she spoke rapidly yes till now if there are sixty three same type robots one of which is wanted and the identity of which cannot be determined why wont any of them do whats the idea of all this why have we been sent for bogert said in resigned fashion if youll give me a chance susan hyper base happens to be using several robots whose brains are not impressioned with the entire first law of robotics arent impressioned calvin slumped back in her chair i see how many were made a few it was on government order and there was no way of violating the secrecy no one was to know except the top men directly concerned you werent included susan it was nothing i had anything to do with the general interrupted with a measure of authority i would like to explain that bit i hadnt been aware that dr calvin was unacquainted with the situation i neednt tell you dr calvin that there always has been strong opposition to robots on the planet the only defense the government has had against the fundamentalist radicals in this matter was the fact that robots are always built with an unbreakable first law which makes it impossible for them to harm human beings under any circumstance but we had to have robots of a different nature so just a few of the ns model the nestors that is were prepared with a modified first law to keep it quiet all ns s are manufactured without serial numbers modified members are delivered here along with a group of normal robots and of course all our kind are under the strictest impressionment never to tell of their modification to unauthorized personnel he wore an embarrassed smile this has all worked out against us now calvin said grimly have you asked each one who it is anyhow certainly you are authorized the general nodded all sixty three deny having worked here and one is lying does the one you want show traces of wear the others i take it are factory fresh the one in question only arrived last month it and the two that have just arrived were to be the last we needed theres no perceptible wear he shook his head slowly and his eyes were haunted again dr calvin we dont dare let that ship leave if the existence of non first law robots becomes general knowledge there seemed no way of avoiding understatement in the conclusion destroy all sixty three said the robopsychologist coldly and flatly and make an end of it bogert drew back a corner of his mouth you mean destroy thirty thousand dollars per robot im afraid u s robots wouldnt like that wed better make an effort first susan before we destroy anything in that case she said sharply i need facts exactly what advantage does hyper base derive from these modified robots what factor made them desirable general kallner ruffled his forehead and stroked it with an upward gesture of his hand we had trouble with our previous robots our men work with hard radiations a good deal you see its dangerous of course but reasonable precautions are taken there have been only two accidents since we began and neither was fatal however it was impossible to explain that to an ordinary robot the first law states ill quote it no robot may harm a human being or through inactiotn allow a human being to come to harm thats primary dr calvin when it was necessary for one of our men to expose himself for a short period to a moderate gamma field one that would have no physiological effects the nearest robot would dash in to drag him out if the field were exceedingly weak it would succeed and work could not continue till all robots were cleared out if the field were a trifle stronger the robot would never reach the technician concerned since its positronic brain would collapse under gamma radiations and then we would be out one expensive and hard to replace robot we tried arguing with them their point was that a human being in a gamma field was endangering his life and that it didnt matter that he could remain there half an hour safely supposing they would say he forgot and remained an hour they couldnt take chances we pointed out that they were risking their lives on a wild off chance but selfpreservation is only the third law of robotics and the first law of human safety came first we gave them orders we ordered them strictly and harshly to remain out of gamma fields at whatever cost but obedience is only the second law of robotics and the first law of human safety came first dr calvin we either had to do without robots or do something about the first law and we made our choice i cant believe said dr calvin that it was found possible to remove the first law it wasnt removed it was modified explained kallner positronic brains were constructed that contained the positive aspect only of the law which in them reads no robot may harm a human being that is all they have no compulsion to prevent one coming to harm through an extraneous agency such as gamma rays i state the matter correctly dr bogert quite assented the mathematician and that is the only difference of your robots from the ordinary ns model the only difference peter the only difference susan she rose and spoke with finality i intend sleeping now and in about eight hours i want to speak to whomever saw the robot last and from now on general kallner if im to take any responsibility at all for events i want full and unquestioned control of this investigation susan calvin except for two hours of resentful lassitude experienced nothing approaching sleep she signaled at bogerts door at the local time of and found him also awake he had apparently taken the trouble of transporting a dressing gown to hyper base with him for he was sitting in it he put his nail scissors down when calvin entered he said softly ive been expecting you more or less i suppose you feel sick about all this i do well im sorry there was no way of preventing it when the call came out from hyper base for us i knew that something must have gone wrong with the modified nestors but what was there to do i couldnt break the matter to you on the trip here as i would have liked to because i had to be sure the matter of the modification is top secret the psychologist muttered i should have been told u s robots had no right to modify positronic brains this way without the approval of a psychologist bogert lifted his eyebrows and sighed be reasonable susan you couldnt have influenced them in this matter the government was bound to have its way they want the hyperatomic drive and the etheric physicists want robots that wont interfere with them they were going to get them even if it did mean twisting the first law we had to admit it was possible from a construction standpoint and they swore a mighty oath that they wanted only twelve that they would be used only at hyper base that they would be destroyed once the drive was perfected and that full precautions would be taken and they insisted on secrecy and thats the situation dr calvin spoke through her teeth i would have resigned it wouldnt have helped the government was offering the company a fortune and threatening it with antirobot legislation in case of a refusal we were stuck then and were badly stuck now if this leaks out it might hurt kallner and the government but it would hurt u s robots a devil of a lot more the psychologist stared at him peter dont you realize what all this is about cant you understand what the removal of the first law means it isnt just a matter of secrecy i know what removal would mean im not a child it would mean complete instability with no nonimaginary solutions to the positronic field equations yes mathematically but can you translate that into crude psychological thought all normal life peter consciously or otherwise resents domination if the domination is by an inferior or by a supposed inferior the resentment becomes stronger physically and to an extent mentally a robot any robot is superior to human beings what makes him slavish then only the first lawl why without it the first order you tried to give a robot would result in your death unstable what do you think susan said bogert with an air of sympathetic amusement ill admit that this frankenstein complex youre exhibiting has a certain justification hence the first law in the first place but the law i repeat and repeat has not been removed merely modified and what about the stability of the brain the mathematician thrust out his lips decreased naturally but its within the border of safety the first nestors were delivered to hyper base nine months ago and nothing whatever has gone wrong till now and even this involves merely fear of discovery and not danger to humans very well then well see what comes of the morning conference bogert saw her politely to the door and grimaced eloquently when she left he saw no reason to change his perennial opinion of her as a sour and fidgety frustration susan calvins train of thought did not include bogert in the least she had dismissed him years ago as a smooth and pretentious sleekness gerald black had taken his degree in etheric physics the year before and in common with his entire generation of physicists found himself engaged in the problem of the drive he now made a proper addition to the general atmosphere of these meetings on hyper base in his stained white smock he was half rebellious and wholly uncertain his stocky strength seemed striving for release and his fingers as they twisted each other with nervous yanks might have forced an iron bar out of true major general kallner sat beside him the two from u s robots faced him black said im told that i was the last to see nestor before he vanished i take it you want to ask me about that dr calvin regarded him with interest you sound as if you were not sure young man dont you know whether you were the last to see him he worked with me maam on the field generators and he was with me the morning of his disappearance i dont know if anyone saw him after about noon no one admits having done so do you think anyones lying about it i dont say that but i dont say that i want the blame of it either his dark eyes smoldered theres no question of blame the robot acted as it did because of what it is were just trying to locate it mr black and lets put everything else aside now if youve worked with the robot you probably know it better than anyone else was there anything unusual about it that you noticed had you ever worked with robots before ive worked with other robots we have here the simple ones nothing different about the nestors except that theyre a good deal cleverer and more annoying annoying in what way well perhaps its not their fault the work here is rough and most of us get a little jagged fooling around with hyper space isnt fun he smiled feebly finding pleasure in confession we run the risk continually of blowing a hole in normal space time fabric and dropping right out of the universe asteroid and all sounds screwy doesnt it naturally youre on edge sometimes but these nestors arent theyre curious theyre calm they dont worry its enough to drive you nuts at times when you want something done in a tearing hurry they seem to take their time sometimes id rather do without you say they take their time have they ever refused an order oh no hastily they do it all right they tell you when they think youre wrong though they dont know anything about the subject but what we taught them but that doesnt stop them maybe i imagine it but the other fellows have the same trouble with their nestors general kallner cleared his throat ominously why have no complaints reached me on the matter black the young physicist reddened we didnt really want to do without the robots sir and besides we werent certain exactly how such uh minor complaints might be received bogert interrupted softly anything in particular happen the morning you last saw it there was a silence with a quiet motion calvin repressed the comment that was about to emerge from kallner and waited patiently then black spoke in blurting anger i had a little trouble with it id broken a kimball tube that morning and was out five days of work my entire program was behind schedule i hadnt received any mail from home for a couple of weeks and he came around wanting me to repeat an experiment i had abandoned a month ago he was always annoying me on that subject and i was tired of it i told him to go away and thats all i saw of him you told him to go away asked dr calvin with sharp interest in just those words did you say go away try to remember the exact words there was apparently an internal struggle in progress black cradled his forehead in a broad palm for a moment then tore it away and said defiantly i said go lose yourself bogert laughed for a short moment and he did eh but calvin wasnt finished she spoke cajolingly now were getting somewhere mr black but exact details are important in understanding the robots actions a word a gesture an emphasis may be everything you couldnt have said just those three words for instance could you by your own description you must have been in a hasty mood perhaps you strengthened your speech a little the young man reddened well i may have called it a a few things exactly what things oh i wouldnt remember exactly besides i couldnt repeat it you know how you get when youre excited his embarrassed laugh was almost a giggle i sort of have a tendency to strong language thats quite all right she replied with prim severity at the moment im a psychologist i would like to have you repeat exactly what you said as nearly as you remember and even more important the exact tone of voice you used black looked at his commanding officer for support found none his eyes grew round and appalled but i cant you must suppose said bogert with ill hidden amusement you address me you may find it easier the young mans scarlet face turned to bogert he swallowed i said his voice faded out he tried again i said and he drew a deep breath and spewed it out hastily in one long succession of syllables then in the charged air that lingered he concluded almost in tears more or less i dont remember the exact order of what i called him and maybe i left out something or put in something but that was about it only the slightest flush betrayed any feeling on the part of the robopsychologist she said i am aware of the meaning of most of the terms used the others i suppose are equally derogatory im afraid so agreed the tormented black and in among it you told him to lose himself i meant it only figuratively i realize that no disciplinary action is intended i am sure and at her glance the general who five seconds earlier had seemed not sure at all nodded angrily you may leave mr black thank you for your cooperation it took five hours for susan calvin to interview the sixty three robots it was five hours of multi repetition of replacement after replacement of identical robot of questions a b c d and answers a b c d of a carefully bland expression a carefully neutral tone a carefully friendly atmosphere and a hidden wire recorder the psychologist felt drained of vitality when she was finished bogert was waiting for her and looked expectant as she dropped the recording spool with a clang upon the plastic of the desk she shook her head all sixty three seemed the same to me i couldnt tell he said you couldnt expect to tell by ear susan suppose we analyze the recordings ordinarily the mathematical interpretation of verbal reactions of robots is one of the more intricate branches of robotic analysis it requires a staff of trained technicians and the help of complicated computing machines bogert knew that bogert stated as much in an extreme of unshown annoyance after having listened to each set of replies made lists of word deviations and graphs of the intervals of responses there are no anomalies present susan the variations in wording and the time reactions are within the limits of ordinary frequency groupings we need finer methods they must have computers here no he frowned and nibbled delicately at a thumbnail we cant use computers too much danger of leakage or maybe if we dr calvin stopped him with an impatient gesture please peter this isnt one of your petty laboratory problems if we cant determine the modified nestor by some gross difference that we can see with the naked eye one that there is no mistake about were out of luck the danger of being wrong and of letting him escape is otherwise too great its not enough to point out a minute irregularity in a graph i tell you if thats all ive got to go on id destroy them all just to be certain have you spoken to the other modified nestors yes i have snapped back bogert and theres nothing wrong with them theyre above normal in friendliness if anything they answered my questions displayed pride in their knowledge except the two new ones that havent had time to learn their etheric physics they laughed rather good naturedly at my ignorance in some of the specializations here he shrugged i suppose that forms some of the basis for resentment toward them on the part of the technicians here the robots are perhaps too willing to impress you with their greater knowledge can you try a few planar reactions to see if there has been any change any deterioration in their mental set up since manufacture i havent yet but i will he shook a slim finger at her youre losing your nerve susan i dont see what it is youre dramatizing theyre essentially harmless they are calvin took fire they are do you realize one of them is lying one of the sixty three robots i have just interviewed has deliberately lied to me after the strictest injunction to tell the truth the abnormality indicated is horribly deep seated and horribly frightening peter bogert felt his teeth harden against each other he said not at all look nestor was given orders to lose himself those orders were expressed in maximum urgency by the person most authorized to command him you cant counteract that order either by superior urgency or superior right of command naturally the robot will attempt to defend the carrying out of his orders in fact objectively i admire his ingenuity how better can a robot lose himself than to hide himself among a group of similar robots yes you would admire it ive detected amusement in you peter amusement and an appalling lack of understanding are you a roboticist peter those robots attach importance to what they consider superiority youve just said as much yourself subconsciously they feel humans to be inferior and the first law which protects us from them is imperfect they are unstable and here we have a young man ordering a robot to leave him to lose himself with every verbal appearance of revulsion disdain and disgust granted that robot must follow orders but subconsciously there is resentment it will become more important than ever for it to prove that it is superior despite the horrible names it was called it may become so important that whats left of the first law wont be enough how on earth or anywhere in the solar system susan is a robot going to know the meaning of the assorted strong language used upon him obscenity is not one of the things impressioned upon his brain original impressionment is not everything calvin snarled at him robots have learning capacity you you fool and bogert knew that she had really lost her temper she continued hastily dont you suppose he could tell from the tone used that the words werent complimentary dont yon suppose hes heard the words used before and noted upon what occasions well then shouted bogert will you kindly tell me one way in which a modified robot can harm a human being no matter how offended it is no matter how sick with desire to prove superiority if i tell you one way will you keep quiet yes they were leaning across the table at each other angry eyes nailed together the psychologist said if a modified robot were to drop a heavy weight upon a human being he would not be breaking the first law if he did so with the knowledge that his strength and reaction speed would be sufficient to snatch the weight away before it struck the man however once the weight left his fingers he would be no longer the active medium only the blind force of gravity would be that the robot could then change his mind and merely by inaction allow the weight to strike the modified first law allows that thats an awful stretch of imagination thats what my profession requires sometimes peter lets not quarrel lets work you know the exact nature of the stimulus that caused the robot to lose himself you have the records of his original mental make up i want you to tell me how possible it is for our robot to do the sort of thing i just talked about not the specific instance mind you but that whole class of response and i want it done quickly and meanwhile and meanwhile well have to try performance tests directly on the response to first law gerald black at his own request was supervising the mushrooming wooden partitions that were springing up in a bellying circle on the vaulted third floor of radiation building the laborers worked in the main silently but more than one was openly a wonder at the sixty three photocells that required installation one of them sat down near black removed his hat and wiped his forehead thoughtfully with a freckled forearm black nodded at him hows it doing walensky walensky shrugged and fired a cigar smooth as butter whats going on anyway doc first theres no work for three days and then we have this mess of jiggers he leaned backward on his elbows and puffed smoke black twitched his eyebrows a couple of robot men came over from earth remember the trouble we had with robots running into the gamma fields before we pounded it into their skulls that they werent to do it yeah didnt we get new robots we got some replacements but mostly it was a job of indoctrination anyway the people who make them want to figure out robots that arent hit so bad by gamma rays sure seems funny though to stop all the work on the drive for this robot deal i thought nothing was allowed to stop the drive well its the fellows upstairs that have the say on that me i just do as im told probably all a matter of pull yeah the electrician jerked a smile and winked a wise eye somebody knew somebody in washington but as long as my pay comes through on the dot i should worry the drives none of my affair what are they going to do here youre asking me they brought a mess of robots with them over sixty and theyre going to measure reactions thats all my knowledge how long will it take i wish i knew well walensky said with heavy sarcasm as long as they dish me my money they can play games all they want black felt quietly satisfied let the story spread it was harmless and near enough to the truth to take the fangs out of curiosity a man sat in the chair motionless silent a weight dropped crashed downward then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam in sixty three wooden cells watching ns robots dashed forward in that split second before the weight veered and sixty three photocells five feet ahead of their original positions jiggled the marking pen and presented a little jag on the paper the weight rose and dropped rose and dropped rose ten times ten times the robots sprang forward and stopped as the man remained safely seated major general kallner had not worn his uniform in its entirety since the first dinner with the u s robot representatives he wore nothing over his blue gray shirt now the collar was open and the black tie was pulled loose he looked hopefully at bogert who was still blandly neat and whose inner tension was perhaps betrayed only by the trace of glister at his temples the general said how does it look what is it youre trying to see bogert replied a difference which may turn out to be a little too subtle for our purposes im afraid for sixty two of those robots the necessity of jumping toward the apparently threatened human was what we call in robotics a forced reaction you see even when the robots knew that the human in question would not come to harm and after the third or fourth time they must have known it they could not prevent reacting as they did first law requires it well but the sixty third robot the modified nestor had no such complusion he was under free action if he had wished he could have remained in his seat unfortunately said his voice was mildly regretful he didnt so wish why do you suppose bogert shrugged i suppose dr calvin will tell us when she gets here probably with a horribly pessimistic interpretation too she is sometimes a bit annoying shes qualified isnt she demanded the general with a sudden frown of uneasiness yes bogert seemed amused shes qualified all right she understands robots like a sister comes from hating human beings so much i think its just that psychologist or not shes an extreme neurotic has paranoid tendencies dont take her too seriously he spread the long row of broken line graphs out in front of him you see general in the case of each robot the time interval from moment of drop to the completion of a five foot movement tends to decrease as the tests are repeated theres a definite mathematical relationship that governs such things and failure to conform would indicate marked abnormality in the positronic brain unfortunately all here appear normal but if our nestor was not responding with a forced action why isnt his curve different i dont understand that its simple enough robotic responses are not perfectly analogous to human responses mores the pity in human beings voluntary action is much slower than reflex action but thats not the case with robots with them it is merely a question of freedom of choice otherwise the speeds of free and forced action are much the same what i had been expecting though was that nestor would be caught by surprise the first time and allow too great an interval to elapse before responding and he didnt im afraid not then we havent gotten anywhere the general sat back with an expression of pain its five days since youve come at this point susan calvin entered and slammed the door behind her put your graphs away peter she cried you know they dont show anything she mumbled something impatiently as kallner half rose to greet her and went on well have to try something else quickly i dont like whats happening bogert exchanged a resigned glance with the general is anything wrong you mean specifically no but i dont like to have nestor continue to elude us its bad it must be gratifying his swollen sense of superiority im afraid that his motivation is no longer simply one of following orders i think its becoming more a matter of sheer neurotic necessity to outthink humans thats a dangerously unhealthy situation peter have you done what i asked have you worked out the instability factors of the modified ns along the lines i want its in progress said the mathematician without interest she stared at him angrily for a moment then turned to kallner nester is decidedly aware of what were doing general he had no reason to jump for the bait in this experiment especially after the first time when he must have seen that there was no real danger to our subject the others couldnt help it but he was deliberately falsifying a reaction what do you think we ought to do now then dr calvin make it impossible for him to fake an action the next time we will repeat the experiment but with an addition high tension cables capable of electrocuting the nestor models will be placed between subject and robot enough of them to avoid the possibility of jumping over and the robot will be made perfectly aware in advance that touching the cables will mean death hold on spat out bogert with sudden viciousness i rule that out we are not electrocuting two million dollars worth of robots to locate nestor there are other ways youre certain youve found none in any case its not a question of electrocution we can arrange a relay which will break the current at the instant of application of weight if the robot should place his weight on it he wont die but he wont know that you see the generals eyes gleamed into hope will that work it should under those conditions nestor would have to remain in his seat he could be ordered to touch the cables and die for the second law of obedience is superior to the third law of self preservation but he wont be ordered to he will merely be left to his own devices as will all the robots in the case of the normal robots the first law of human safety will drive them to their death even without orders but not our nestor without the entire first law and without having received any orders on the matter the third law self preservation will be the highest operating and he will have no choice but to remain in his seat it would be a forced action will it be done tonight then tonight said the psychologist if the cables can be laid in time ill tell the robots now what theyre to be up against a man sat in the chair motionless silent a weight dropped crashed downward then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam only once and from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony dr susan calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror sixty three robots sat quietly in their chairs staring owlishly at the endangered man before them not one moved dr calvin was angry angry almost past endurance angry the worse for not daring to show it to the robots that one by one were entering the room and then leaving she checked the list number twenty eight was due in now thirty five still lay ahead of her number twenty eight entered diffidently she forced herself into reasonable calm and who are you the robot replied in a low uncertain voice i have received no number of my own yet maam im an ns robot and i was number twenty eight in line outside i have a slip of paper here that im to give to you you havent been in here before this today no maam sit down right there i want to ask you some questions number twenty eight were you in the radiation room of building two about four hours ago the robot had trouble answering then it came out hoarsely like machinery needing oil yes maam there was a man who almost came to harm there wasnt there yes maam you did nothing did you no maam the man might have been hurt because of your inaction do you know that yes maam i couldnt help it maam it is hard to picture a large expressionless metallic figure cringing but it managed i want you to tell me exactly why you did nothing to save him i want to explain maam i certainly dont want to have you have anyone think that i could do a thing that might cause harm to a master oh no that would be a horrible an inconceivable please dont get excited boy im not blaming you for anything i only want to know what you were thinking at the time maam before it all happened you told us that one of the masters would be in danger of harm from that weight that keeps falling and that we would have to cross electric cables if we were to try to save him well maam that wouldnt stop me what is my destruction compared to the safety of a master but but it occurred to me that if i died on my way to him i wouldnt be able to save him anyway the weight would crush him and then i would be dead for no purpose and perhaps some day some other master might come to harm who wouldnt have if i had only stayed alive do you understand me maam you mean that it was merely a choice of the man dying or both the man and yourself dying is that right yes maam it was impossible to save the master he might be considered dead in that case it is inconceivable that i destroy myself for nothing without orders the robopsychologist twiddled a pencil she had heard the same story with insignificant verbal variations twenty seven times before this was the crucial question now boy she said your thinking has its points but it is not the sort of thing i thought you might think did you think of this yourself the robot hesitated no who thought of it then we were talking last night and one of us got that idea and it sounded reasonable which one the robot thought deeply i dont know just one of us she sighed thats all number twenty nine was next thirty four after that major general kallner too was angry for one week all of hyper base had stopped dead barring some paper work on the subsidiary asteroids of the group for nearly one week the two top experts in the field had aggravated the situation with useless tests and now they or the woman at any rate made impossible propositions fortunately for the general situation kallner felt it impolitic to display his anger openly susan calvin was insisting why not sir its obvious that the present situation is unfortunate the only way we may reach results in the future or what future is left us in this matter is to separate the robots we cant keep them together any longer my dear dr calvin rumbled the general his voice sinking into the lower baritone registers i dont see how i can quarter sixty three robots all over the place dr calvin raised her arms helplessly i can do nothing then nestor will either imitate what the other robots would do or else argue them plausibly into not doing what he himself cannot do and in any case this is bad business were in actual combat with this little lost robot of ours and hes winning out every victory of his aggravates his abnormality she rose to her feet in determination general kallner if you do not separate the robots as i ask then i can only demand that all sixty three be destroyed immediately you demand it do you bogert looked up suddenly and with real anger what gives you the right to demand any such thing those robots remain as they are im responsible to the management not you and i added major general kallner am responsible to the world co ordinator and i must have this settled in that case flashed back calvin there is nothing for me to do but resign if necessary to force you to the necessary destruction ill make this whole matter public it was not i that approved the manufacture of modified robots one word from you dr calvin said the general deliberately in violation of security measures and you would be certainly imprisoned instantly bogert felt the matter to be getting out of hand his voice grew syrupy well now were beginning to act like children all of us we need only a little more time surely we can outwit a robot without resigning or imprisoning people or destroying two millions the psychologist turned on him with quiet fury i dont want any unbalanced robots in existence we have one nestor thats definitely unbalanced eleven more that are potentially so and sixty two normal robots that are being subjected to an unbalanced environment the only absolute safe method is complete destruction the signal burr brought all three to a halt and the angry tumult of growingly unrestrained emotion froze come in growled kallner it was gerald black looking perturbed he had heard angry voices he said i thought id come myself didnt like to ask anyone else what is it dont orate the locks of compartment c in the trading ship have been played with there are fresh scratches on them compartment c explained calvin quickly thats the one that holds the robots isnt it who did it from the inside said black laconically the lock isnt out of order is it no its all right ive been staying on the ship now for four days and none of them have tried to get out but i thought you ought to know and i didnt like to spread the news i noticed the matter myself is anyone there now demanded the general i left robbins and mcadams there there was a thoughtful silence and then dr calvin said ironically well kallner rubbed his nose uncertainly whats it all about isnt it obvious nester is planning to leave that order to lose himself is dominating his abnormality past anything we can do i wouldnt be surprised if whats left of his first law would scarcely be powerful enough to override it he is perfectly capable of seizing the ship and leaving with it then wed have a mad robot on a spaceship what would he do next any idea do you still want to leave them all together general nonsense interrupted bogert he had regained his smoothness all that from a few scratch marks on a lock have you dr bogert completed the analysis ive required since you volunteer opinions yes may i see it no why not or maynt i ask that either because theres no point in it susan i told you in advance that these modified robots are less stable than the normal variety and my analysis shows it theres a certain very small chance of breakdown under extreme circumstances that are not likely to occur let it go at that i wont give you ammunition for your absurd claim that sixty two perfectly good robots be destroyed just because so far you lack the ability to detect nestor among them susan calvin stared him down and let disgust fill her eyes you wont let anything stand in the way of the permanent directorship will you please begged kallner half in irritation do you insist that nothing further can be done dr calvin i cant think of anything sir she replied wearily if there were only other differences between nestor and the normal robots differences that didnt involve the first law even one other difference something in impressionment environment specification and she stopped suddenly what is it ive thought of something i think her eyes grew distant and hard these modified nestors peter they get the same impressioning the normal ones get dont they yes exactly the same and what was it you were saying mr black she turned to the young man who through the storms that had followed his news had maintained a discreet silence once when complaining of the nestors attitude of superiority you said the technicians had taught them all they knew yes in etheric physics theyre not acquainted with the subject when they come here thats right said bogert in surprise i told you susan when i spoke to the other nestors here that the two new arrivals hadnt learned etheric physics yet and why is that dr calvin was speaking in mounting excitement why arent ns models impressioned with etheric physics to start with i can tell you that said kallner its all of a piece with the secrecy we thought that if we made a special model with knowledge of etheric physics used twelve of them and put the others to work in an unrelated field there might be suspicion men working with normal nestors might wonder why they knew etheric physics so there was merely an impressionment with a capacity for training in the field only the ones that come here naturally receive such a training its that simple i understand please get out of here the lot of you let me have an hour or so calvin felt she could not face the ordeal for a third time her mind had contemplated it and rejected it with an intensity that left her nauseated she could face that unending file of repetitious robots no more so bogert asked the question now while she sat aside eyes and mind half closed number fourteen came in forty nine to go bogert looked up from the guide sheet and said what is your number in line fourteen sir the robot presented his numbered ticket sit down boy bogert asked you havent been here before on this day no sir well boy we are going to have another man in danger of harm soon after were through here in fact when you leave this room you will be led to a stall where you will wait quietly till you are needed do you understand yes sir now naturally if a man is in danger of harm you will try to save him naturally sir unfortunately between the man and yourself there will be a gamma ray field silence do you know what gamma rays are asked bogert sharply energy radiation sir the next question came in a friendly offhand manner ever work with gamma rays no sir the answer was definite mm m well boy gamma rays will kill you instantly theyll destroy your brain that is a fact you must know and remember naturally you dont want to destroy yourself naturally again the robot seemed shocked then slowly but sir if the gamma rays are between myself and the master that may be harmed how can i save him i would be destroying myself to no purpose yes there is that bogert seemed concerned about the matter the only thing i can advise boy is that if you detect the gamma radiation between yourself and the man you may as well sit where you are the robot was openly relieved thank you sir there wouldnt be any use would there of course not but if there werent any dangerous radiation that would be a different matter naturally sir no question of that you may leave now the man on the other side of the door will lead you to your stall please wait there he turned to susan calvin when the robot left how did that go susan very well she said dully do you think we could catch nestor by quick questioning on etheric physics perhaps but its not sure enough her hands lay loosely in her lap remember hes fighting us hes on his guard the only way we can catch him is to outsmart him and within his limitations he can think much more quickly than a human being well just for fun suppose i ask the robots from now on a few questions on gamma rays wave length limits for instance no dr calvins eyes sparked to life it would be too easy for him to deny knowledge and then hed be warned against the test thats coming up which is our real chance please follow the questions ive indicated peter and dont improvise its just within the bounds of risk to ask them if theyve ever worked with gamma rays and try to sound even less interested than you do when you ask it bogert shrugged and pressed the buzzer that would allow the entrance of number fifteen the large radiation room was in readiness once more the robots waited patiently in their wooden cells all open to the center but closed off from each other major general kallner mopped his brow slowly with a large handkerchief while dr calvin checked the last details with black youre sure now she demanded that none of the robots have had a chance to talk with each other after leaving the orientation room absolutely sure insisted black theres not been a word exchanged and the robots are put in the proper stalls heres the plan the psychologist looked at it thoughtfully um m m the general peered over her shoulder whats the idea of the arrangement dr calvin ive asked to have those robots that appeared even slightly out of true in the previous tests concentrated on one side of the circle im going to be sitting in the center myself this time and i wanted to watch those particularly youre going to be sitting there exclaimed bogert why not she demanded coldly what i expect to see may be something quite momentary i cant risk having anyone else as main observer peter youll be in the observing booth and i want you to keep your eye on the opposite side of the circle general kallner ive arranged for motion pictures to be taken of each robot in case visual observation isnt enough if these are required the robots are to remain exactly where they are until the pictures are developed and studied none must leave none must change place is that clear perfectly then lets try it this one last time susan calvin sat in the chair silent eyes restless a weight dropped crashed downward then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam and a single robot jerked upright and took two steps and stopped but dr calvin was upright and her finger pointed to him sharply nestor come here she cried come here come here slowly reluctantly the robot took another step forward the psychologist shouted at the top of her voice without taking her eyes from the robot get every other robot out of this place somebody get them out quickly and keep them out somewhere within reach of her ears there was noise and the thud of hard feet upon the floor she did not look away nestor if it was nestor took another step and then under force of her imperious gesture two more he was only ten feet away when he spoke harshly i have been told to be lost another stop i must not disobey they have not found me so far he would think me a failure he told me but its not so i am powerful and intelligent the words came in spurts another step i know a good deal he would think i mean ive been found disgraceful not i i am intelligent and by just a master who is weak slow another step and one metal arm flew out suddenly to her shoulder and she felt the weight bearing her down her throat constricted and she felt a shriek tear through dimly she heard nestor s next words no one must find me no master and the cold metal was against her and she was sinking under the weight of it and then a queer metallic sound and she was on the ground with an unfelt thump and a gleaming arm was heavy across her body it did not move nor did nestor who sprawled beside her and now faces were bending over her gerald black was gasping are you hurt dr calvin she shook her head feebly they pried the arm off her and lifted her gently to her feet what happened black said i bathed the place in gamma rays for five seconds we didnt know what was happening it wasnt till the last second that we realized he was attacking you and then there was no time for anything but a gamma field he went down in an instant there wasnt enough to harm you though dont worry about it im not worried she closed her eyes and leaned for a moment upon his shoulder i dont think i was attacked exactly nestor was simply trying to do so what was left of the first law was still holding him back susan calvin and peter bogert two weeks after their first meeting with major general kallner had their last work at hyper base had been resumed the trading ship with its sixty two normal ns s was gone to wherever it was bound with an officially imposed story to explain its two weeks delay the government cruiser was making ready to carry the two roboticists back to earth kallner was once again a gleam in dress uniform his white gloves shone as he shook hands calvin said the other modified nestors are of course to be destroyed they will be well make shift with normal robots or if necessary do without good but tell me you havent explained how was it done she smiled tightly oh that i would have told you in advance if i had been more certain of its working you see nestor had a superiority complex that was becoming more radical all the time he liked to think that he and other robots knew more than human beings it was becoming very important for him to think so we knew that so we warned every robot in advance that gamma rays would kill them which it would and we further warned them all that gamma rays would be between them and myself so they all stayed where they were naturally by nestor s own logic in the previous test they had all decided that there was no point in trying to save a human being if they were sure to die before they could do it well yes dr calvin i understand that but why did nestor himself leave his seat ah that was a little arrangement between myself and your young mr black you see it wasnt gamma rays that flooded the area between myself and the robots but infrared rays just ordinary heat rays absolutely harmless nestor knew they were infrared and harmless and so he began to dash out as he expected the rest would do under first law compulsion it was only a fraction of a second too late that he remembered that the normal ns s could detect radiation but could not identify the type that he himself could only identify wave lengths by virtue of the training he had received at hyper base under mere human beings was a little too humiliating to remember for just a moment to the normal robots the area was fatal because we had told them it would be and only nestor knew we were lying and just for a moment he forgot or didnt want to remember that other robots might be more ignorant than human beings his very superiority caught him good by general escape when susan calvin returned from hyper base alfred tanning was waiting for her the old man never spoke about his age but everyone knew it to be over seventy five yet his mind was keen and if he had finally allowed himself to be made director emeritus of research with bogert as acting director it did not prevent him from appearing in his office daily how close are they to the hyperatomic drive he asked i dont know she replied irritably i didnt ask hmm i wish theyd hurry because if they dont consolidated might beat them to it and beat us to it as well consolidated what have they got to do with it well were not the only ones with calculating machines ours may be positronic but that doesnt mean theyre better robertson is calling a big meeting about it tomorrow hes been waiting for you to come back robertson of u s robot amp mechanical men corporation son of the founder pointed his lean nose at his general manager and his adams apple jumped as he said you start now lets get this straight the general manager did so with alacrity heres the deal now chief consolidated robots approached us a month ago with a funny sort of proposition they brought about five tons of figures equations all that sort of stuff it was a problem see and they wanted an answer from the brain the terms were as follows he ticked them off on thick fingers a hundred thousand for us if there is no solution and we can tell them the missing factors two hundred thousand if there is a solution plus costs of construction of the machine involved plus quarter interest in all profits derived therefrom the problem concerns the development of an interstellar engine robertson frowned and his lean figure stiffened despite the fact that they have a thinking machine of their own right exactly what makes the whole proposition a foul ball chief levver take it from there abe levver looked up from the far end of the conference table and smoothed his stubbled chin with a faint rasping sound he smiled its this way sir consolidated had a thinking machine its broken what robertson half rose thats right brokenl its kaput nobody knows why but i got hold of some pretty interesting guesses like for instance that they asked it to give them an interstellar engine with the same set of information they came to us with and that it cracked their machine wide open its scrap just scrap now you get it chief the general manager was wildly jubilant you get it there isnt any industrial research group of any size that isnt trying to develop a space warp engine and consolidated and u s robots have the lead on the field with our super robot brains now that theyve managed to foul theirs up we have a clear field thats the nub the uh motivation it will take them six years at least to build another and theyre sunk unless they can break ours too with the same problem the president of u s robots bulged his eyes why the dirty rats hold on chief theres more to this he pointed a finger with a wide sweep lanning take it dr alfred lanning viewed the proceedings with faint scorn his usual reaction to the doings of the vastly betterpaid business and sales divisions his unbelievable gray eyebrows hunched low and his voice was dry from a scientific standpoint the situation while not entirely clear is subject to intelligent analysis the question of interstellar travel under present conditions of physical theory is uh vague the matter is wide open and the information given by consolidated to its thinking machine assuming these we have to be the same was similarly wide open our mathematical department has given it a thorough analysis and it seems consolidated has included everything its material for submission contains all known developments of franciaccis space warp theory and apparently all pertinent astrophysical and electronic data its quite a mouthful robertson followed anxiously he interrupted too much for the brain to handle lanning shook his head decisively no there are no known limits to the brains capacity its a different matter its a question of the robotic laws the brain for instance could never supply a solution to a problem set to it if that solution would involve the death or injury of humans as far as it would be concerned a problem with only such a solution would be insoluble if such a problem is combined with an extremely urgent demand that it be answered it is just possible that the brain only a robot after all would be presented with a dilemma where it could neither answer nor refuse to answer something of the sort must have happened to consolidateds machine he paused but the general manager urged on go ahead dr tanning explain it the way you explained it to me lanning set his lips and raised his eyebrows in the direction of dr susan calvin who lifted her eyes from her precisely folded hands for the first time her voice was low and colorless the nature of a robot reaction to a dilemma is startling she began robot psychology is far from perfect as a specialist i can assure you of that but it can be discussed in qualitative terms because with all the complications introduced into a robots positronic brain it is built by humans and is therefore built according to human values now a human caught in an impossibility often responds by a retreat from reality by entry into a world of delusion or by taking to drink going off into hysteria or jumping off a bridge it all comes to the same thing a refusal or inability to face the situation squarely and so the robot a dilemma at its mildest will disorder half its relays and at its worst it will burn out every positronic brain path past repair i see said robertson who didnt now what about this information consolidateds wishing on us it undoubtedly involves said dr calvin a problem of a forbidden sort but the brain is considerably different from consolidateds robot thats right chief thats right the general manager was energetically interruptive i want you to get this because its the whole point of the situation susan calvins eyes glittered behind the spectacles and she continued patiently you see sir consolidateds machines their super thinker among them are built without personality they go in for functionalism you know they have to without u s robots basic patents for the emotional brain paths their thinker is merely a calculating machine on a grand scale and a dilemma ruins it instantly however the brain our own machine has a personality a childs personality it is a supremely deductive brain but it resembles an idiot savante it doesnt really understand what it does it just does it and because it is really a child it is more resilient life isnt so serious you might say the robopsychologist continued here is what were going to do we have divided all of consolidateds information into logical units we are going to feed the units to the brain singly and cautiously when the factor enters the one that creates the dilemma the brains child personality will hesitate its sense of judgment is not mature there will be a perceptible interval before it will recognize a dilemma as such and in that interval it will reject the unit automatically before its brainpaths can be set in motion and ruined robertsons adams apple squirmed are you sure now dr calvin masked impatience it doesnt make much sense i admit in lay language but there is no conceivable use in presenting the mathematics of this i assure you it is as i say the general manager was in the breach instantly and fluently so heres the situation chief if we take the deal we can put it through like this the brain will tell us which unit of information involves the dilemma from there we can figure why the dilemma isnt that right dr bogert there you are chief and dr bogert is the best mathematician youll find anywhere we give consolidated a no solution answer with the reason and collect a hundred thousand theyre left with a broken machine were left with a whole one in a year two maybe well have a space warp engine or a hyper atomic motor some people call it whatever you name it it will be the biggest thing in the world robertson chuckled and reached out lets see the contract ill sign it when susan calvin entered the fantastically guarded vault that held the brain one of the current shift of technicians had just asked it if one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days how many eggs will nine chickens lay in nine days the brain had just answered fifty four and the technician had just said to another see you dope dr calvin coughed and there was a sudden impossible flurry of directionless energy the psychologist motioned briefly and she was alone with the brain the brain was a two foot globe merely one which contained within it a thoroughly conditioned helium atmosphere a volume of space completely vibration absent and radiation free and within that was that unheard of complexity of positronic brain paths that was the brain the rest of the room was crowded with the attachments that were the intermediaries between the brain and the outside world its voice its arms its sense organs dr calvin said softly how are you brain the brains voice was high pitched and enthusiastic swell miss susan youre going to ask me something i can tell you always have a book in your hand when youre going to ask me something dr calvin smiled mildly well youre right but not just yet this is going to be a question it will be so complicated were going to give it to you in writing but not just yet i think ill talk to you first all right i dont mind talking now brain in a little while dr lanning and dr bogert will be here with this complicated question well give it to you a very little at a time and very slowly because we want you to be careful were going to ask you to build something if you can out of the information but im going to warn you now that the solution might involve uh damage to human beings gosh the exclamation was hushed drawn out now you watch for that when we come to a sheet which means damage even maybe death dont get excited you see brain in this case we dont mind not even about death we dont mind at all so when you come to that sheet just stop give it back and thatll be all you understand oh sure by golly the death of humans oh my now brain i hear dr lanning and dr bogert coming theyll tell you what the problem is all about and then well start be a good boy now slowly the sheets were fed in after each one came the interval of the queerly whispery chuckling noise that was the brain in action then the silence that meant readiness for another sheet it was a matter of hours during which the equivalent of something like seventeen fat volumes of mathematical physics were fed into the brain as the process went on frowns appeared and deepened lanning muttered ferociously under his breath bogert first gazed speculatively at his fingernails and then bit at them in abstracted fashion it was when the last of the thick pile of sheets disappeared that calvin white faced said somethings wrong lanning barely got the words out it cant be is it dead brain susan calvin was trembling do you hear me brain huh came the abstracted rejoinder do you want me the solution oh that i can do it ill build you a whole ship just as easy if you let me have the robots a nice ship itll take two months maybe there was no difficulty it took long to figure said the brain dr calvin backed away the color had not returned to her thin cheeks she motioned the others away in her office she said i cant understand it the information as given must involve a dilemma probably involves death if something has gone wrong bogert said quietly the machine talks and makes sense it cant be a dilemma but the psychologist replied urgently there are dilemmas and dilemmas there are different forms of escape suppose the brain is only mildly caught just badly enough say to be suffering from the delusion that he can solve the problem when he cant or suppose its teetering on the brink of something really bad so that any small push shoves it over suppose said lanning there is no dilemma suppose consolidateds machine broke down over a different question or broke down for purely mechanical reasons but even so insisted calvin we couldnt take chances listen from now on no one is to as much as breathe to the brain im taking over all right sighed lanning take over then and meanwhile well let the brain build its ship and if it does build it well have to test it he was ruminating well need our top field men for that michael donovan brushed down his red hair with a violent motion of his hand and a total indifference to the fact that the unruly mass sprang to attention again immediately he said call the turn now greg they say the ship is finished they dont know what it is but its finished lets go greg lets grab the controls right now powell said wearily cut it mike theres a peculiar overripe flavor to your humor at its freshest and the confined atmosphere here isnt helping it well listen donovan took another ineffectual swipe at his hair im not worried so much about our cast iron genius and his tin ship theres the matter of my lost leave and the monotony theres nothing here but whiskers and figures the wrong kind of figures oh why do they give us these jobs because replied powell gently were no loss if they lose us o k relax doc lannings coming this way lanning was coming his gray eyebrows as lavish as ever his aged figure unbent as yet and full of life he walked silently up the ramp with the two men and out into the open field where obeying no human master silent robots were building a ship wrong tense had built a ship for lanning said the robots have stopped not one has moved today its completed then definitely asked powell now how can i tell lanning was peevish and his eyebrows curled down in an eye hiding frown it seems done there are no spare pieces about and the interior is down to a gleaming finish youve been inside just in then out im no space pilot either of you two know much about engine theory donovan looked at powell who looked at donovan donovan said ive got my license sir but at last reading it didnt say anything about hyper engines or warp navigation just the usual childs play in three dimensions alfred lanning looked up with sharp disapproval and snorted the length of his prominent nose he said frigidly well we have our engine men powell caught at his elbow as he walked away sir is the ship still restricted ground the old director hesitated then rubbed the bridge of his nose i suppose not for you two anyway donovan looked after him as he left and muttered a short expressive phrase at his back he turned to powell id like to give him a literary description of himself greg suppose you come along mike the inside of the ship was finished as finished as a ship ever was that could be told in a single eye blinking glance no martinet in the system could have put as much spit and polish into a surface as those robots had the walls were of a gleaming silvery finish that retained no fingerprints there were no angles walls floors and ceiling faded gently into each other and in the cold metallic glittering of the hidden lights one was surrounded by six chilly reflections of ones bewildered self the main corridor was a narrow tunnel that led in a hard clatterfooted stretch along a line of rooms of no interdistinguishing features powell said i suppose furniture is built into the wall or maybe were not supposed to sit or sleep it was in the last room the one nearest the nose that the monotony broke a curving window of non reflecting glass was the first break in the universal metal and below it was a single large dial with a single motionless needle hard against the zero mark donovan said look at that and pointed to the single word on the finely marked scale it said parsecs and the tiny figure at the right end of the curving graduated meter said there were two chairs heavy wide flaring uncushioned powell seated himself gingerly and found it molded to the bodys curves and comfortable powell said what do you think of it for my money the brain has brain fever lets get out sure you dont want to look it over a bit i have looked it over i came i saw im through donovans red hair bristled into separate wires greg lets get out of here i quit my job five seconds ago and this is a restricted area for non personnel powell smiled in an oily self satisfied manner and smoothed his mustache o k mike turn off that adrenalin tap youve got draining into your bloodstream i was worried too but no more no more huh how come no more increased your insurance mike this ship cant fly how do you know well weve been through the entire ship havent we seems so take my word for it we have did you see any pilot room except for this one port and the one gauge here in parsecs did you see any controls no and did you see any engines holy joe no well then lets break the news to lanning mike they cursed their way through the featureless corridors and finally hit and missed their way into the short passage to the air lock donovan stiffened did you lock this thing greg no i never touched it yank the lever will you the lever never budged though donovans face twisted appallingly with exertion powell said i didnt see any emergency exits if somethings gone wrong here theyll have to melt us out yes and weve got to wait until they find out that some fool has locked us in here added donovan frantically lets get back to the room with the port its the only place from which we might attract attention but they didnt in that last room the port was no longer blue and full of sky it was black and hard yellow pin point stars spelled space there was a dull double thud as two bodies collapsed separately into two chairs alfred lanning met dr calvin just outside his office he lit a nervous cigar and motioned her in he said well susan weve come pretty far and robertsons getting jumpy what are you doing with the brain susan calvin spread her hands its no use getting impatient the brain is worth more than anything we forfeit on this deal but youve been questioning it for two months the psychologists voice was flat but somehow dangerous you would rather run this yourself now you know what i meant oh i suppose i do dr calvin rubbed her hands nervously it isnt easy ive been pampering it and probing it gently and i havent gotten anywhere yet its reactions arent normal its answers theyre queer somehow but nothing i can put my finger on yet and you see until we know whats wrong we must just tiptoe our way through i can never tell what simple question or remark will just push him over and then well and then well have on our hands a completely useless brain do you want to face that well it cant break the first law i would have thought so but youre not even sure of that lanning was profoundly shocked oh i cant be sure of anything alfred the alarm system raised its fearful clangor with a horrifying suddenness lanning clicked on communications with an almost paralytic spasm the breathless words froze him he said susan you heard that the ships gone i sent those two field men inside half an hour ago youll have to see the brain again susan calvin said with enforced calm brain what happened to the ship the brain said happily the ship i built miss susan thats right what has happened to it why nothing at all the two men that were supposed to test it were inside and we were all set so i sent it off oh well thats nice the psychologist felt some difficulty in breathing do you think theyll be all right right as anything miss susan ive taken care of it all its a bee yootiful ship yes brain it is beautiful but you think they have enough food dont you theyll be comfortable plenty of food this business might be a shock to them brain unexpected you know the brain tossed it off theyll be all right it ought to be interesting for them interesting how just interesting said the brain slyly susan whispered lanning in a fuming whisper ask him if death comes into it ask him what the dangers are susan calvins expression contorted with fury keep quiet in a shaken voice she said to the brain we can communicate with the ship cant we brain oh they can hear you if you call by radio ive taken care of that thanks thats all for now once outside lanning lashed out ragingly great galaxy susan if this gets out it will ruin all of us weve got to get those men back why didnt you ask it if there was danger of death straight out because said calvin with a weary frustration thats just what i cant mention if its got a case of dilemma its about death anything that would bring it up badly might knock it completely out will we be better off then now look it said we could communicate with them lets do so get their location and bring them back they probably cant use the controls themselves the brain is probably handling them remotely come it was quite a while before powell shook himself together mike he said out of cold lips did you feel an acceleration donovans eyes were blank huh no no and then the redheads fists clenched and he was out of his seat with sudden frenzied energy and up against the cold wide curving glass there was nothing to see but stars he turned greg they must have started the machine while we were inside greg its a put up job they fixed it up with the robot to jerry us into being the try out boys in case we were thinking of backing out powell said what are you talking about whats the good of sending us out if we dont know how to run the machine how are we supposed to bring it back no this ship left by itself and without any apparent acceleration he rose and walked the floor slowly the metal walls dinned back the clangor of his steps he said tonelessly mike this is the most confusing situation weve ever been up against that said donovan bitterly is news to me i was just beginning to have a very swell time when you told me powell ignored that no acceleration which means the ship works on a principle different from any known different from any we know anyway different from any known there are no engines within reach of manual control maybe theyre built into the walls maybe thats why theyre thick as they are what are you mumbling about demanded donovan why not listen im saying that whatever powers this ship is enclosed and evidently not meant to be handled the ship is running by remote control the brains control why not then you think well stay out here till the brain brings us back it could be if so lets wait quietly the brain is a robot its got to follow the first law it cant hurt a human being donovan sat down slowly you figure that carefully he flattened his hair listen this junk about the space warp knocked out consolidateds robot and the longhairs said it was because interstellar travel killed humans which robot are you going to trust ours had the same data i understand powell was yanking madly at his mustache dont pretend you dont know your robotics mike before its physically possible in any way for a robot to even make a start to breaking the first law so many things have to break down that it would be a ruined mess of scrap ten times over theres some simple explanation to this oh sure sure just have the butler call me in the morning its all just too too simple for me to bother about before my beauty nap well jupiter mike what are you complaining about so far the brain is taking care of us this place is warm its got light its got air there wasnt even enough of an acceleration jar to muss your hair if it were smooth enough to be mussable in the first place yeah greg you mustve taken lessons no one could put pollyanna that far out of the running without what do we eat what do we drink where are we how do we get back and in case of accident to what exit and in what spacesuit do we run not walk i havent even seen a bathroom in the place or those little conveniences that go along with bathrooms sure were being taken care of but good the voice that interrupted donovans tirade was not powells it was nobodys it was there hanging in open air stentorian and petrifying in its effects gregory powell michael donovan gregory powell michael donovan please report your present positions if your ship answers controls please return to base gregory powell michael donovan the message was repetitious mechanical broken by regular untiring intervals donovan said wheres it coming from i dont know powells voice was an intense whisper where do the lights come from where does anything come from well how are we going to answer they had to speak in the intervals between the loudly echoing repeating message the walls were bare as bare and as unbroken as smooth curving metal can be powell said shout an answer they did they shouted in turns and together position unknown ship out of control condition desperate their voices rose and cracked the short businesslike sentences became interlarded and adulterated with screaming and emphatic profanity but the cold calling voice repeated and repeated and repeated unwearyingly they dont hear us gasped donovan theres no sending mechanism just a receiver his eyes focused blindly at a random spot on the wall slowly the din of the outside voice softened and receded they called again when it was a whisper and they called again hoarsely when there was silence something like fifteen minutes later powell said lifelessly lets go through the ship again there must be something to eat somewheres he did not sound hopeful it was almost an admission of defeat they divided in the corridor to the right and left they could follow one another by the hard footsteps resounding and they met occasionally in the corridor where they would glare at each other and pass on powells search ended suddenly and as it did he heard donovans glad voice rise boomingly hey greg it howled the ship has got plumbing how did we miss it it was some five minutes later that he found powell by hit and miss he was saying still no shower baths though but it got choked off in the middle food he gasped the wall had dropped away leaving a curved gap with two shelves the upper shelf was loaded with unlabeled cans of a bewildering variety of sizes and shapes the enameled cans on the lower shelf were uniform and donovan felt a cold draft about his ankles the lower half was refrigerated how how it wasnt there before said powell curtly that wall section dropped out of sight as i came in the door he was eating the can was the preheating type with enclosed spoon and the warm odor of baked beans filled the room grab a can mike donovan hesitated whats the menu how do i know are you finicky no but all i eat on ships are beans something else would be first choice his hand hovered and selected a shining elliptical can whose flatness seemed reminiscent of salmon or similar delicacy it opened at the proper pressure beans howled donovan and reached for another powell hauled at the slack of his pants better eat that sonny boy supplies are limited and we may be here a long long time donovan drew back sulkily is that all we have beans could be whats on the lower shelf milk just milk donovan cried in outrage looks it the meal of beans and milk was carried through in silence and as they left the strip of hidden wall rose up and formed an unbroken surface once more powell sighed everything automatic everything just so never felt so helpless in my life wheres your plumbing right there and that wasnt among those present when we first looked either fifteen minutes later they were back in the glassed in room staring at each other from opposing seats powell looked gloomily at the one gauge in the room it still said parsecs the figures still ended in and the indicating needle was still pressed hard against the zero mark in the innermost offices of the u s robot amp mechanical men corp alfred lanning was saying wearily they wont answer weve tried every wavelength public private coded straight even this subether stuff they have now and the brain still wont say anything he shot this at dr calvin it wont amplify on the matter alfred she said emphatically it says they can hear us and when i try to press it it becomes well it becomes sullen and its not supposed to whoever heard of a sullen robot suppose you tell us what you have susan said bogert here it is it admits it controls the ship itself entirely it is definitely optimistic about their safety but without details i dont dare press it however the center of disturbance seems to be about the interstellar jump itself the brain definitely laughed when i brought up the subject there are other indications but that is the closest its come to an open abnormality she looked at the others i refer to hysteria i dropped the subject immediately and i hope i did no harm but it gave me a lead i can handle hysteria give me twelve hours if i can bring it back to normal it will bring back the ship bogert seemed suddenly stricken the interstellar jump whats the matter the cry was double from calvin and lanning the figures for the engine the brain gave us say i just thought of something he left hurriedly lanning gazed after him he said brusquely to calvin you take care of your end susan two hours later bogert was talking eagerly i tell you lanning thats it the interstellar jump is not instantaneousnot as long as the speed of light is finite life cant exist matter and energy as such cant exist in the space warp i dont know what it would be like but thats it thats what killed consolidateds robot donovan felt as haggard as he looked only five days only five days im sure of it donovan looked about him wretchedly the stars through the glass were familiar but infinitely indifferent the walls were cold to the touch the lights which had recently flared up again were unfeelingly bright the needle on the gauge pointed stubbornly to zero and donovan could not get rid of the taste of beans he said morosely i need a bath powell looked up briefly and said so do i you neednt feel selfconscious but unless you want to bathe in milk and do without drinking well do without drinking eventually anyway greg where does this interstellar travel come in you tell me maybe we just keep on going wed get there eventually at least the dust of our skeletons would but isnt our death the whole point of the brains original breakdown donovan spoke with his back to the other greg ive been thinking its pretty bad theres not much to do except walk around or talk to yourself you know those stories about guys marooned in space they go nuts long before they starve i dont know greg but ever since the lights went on i feel funny there was a silence then powells voice came thin and small so do i whats it like the redheaded figure turned feel funny inside theres a pounding in me with everything tense its hard to breathe i cant stand still um m m do you feel vibration how do you mean sit down for a minute and listen you dont hear it but you feel it as if somethings throbbing somewheres and its throbbing the whole ship and you too along with it listen yeah yeah what do you think it is greg you dont suppose its us it might be powell stroked his mustache slowly but it might be the ships engines it might be getting ready for what for the interstellar jump it may be coming and the devil knows what its like donovan pondered then he said savagely if it does let it but i wish we could fight its humiliating to have to wait for it an hour later perhaps powell looked at his hand on the metal chair arm and said with frozen calm feel the wall mike donovan did and said you can feel it shake greg even the stars seemed blurred from somewhere came the vague impression of a huge machine gathering power with the walls storing up energy for a mighty leap throbbing its way up the scales of strength it came with a suddenness and a stab of pain powell stiffened and half jerked from his chair his sight caught donovan and blanked out while donovans thin shout whimpered and died in his ears something writhed within him and struggled against a growing blanket of ice that thickened something broke loose and whirled in a blaze of flickering light and pain it fell and whirled and fell headlong into silence it was death it was a world of no motion and no sensation a world of dim unsensing consciousness a consciousness of darkness and of silence and of formless struggle most of all a consciousness of eternity he was a tiny white thread of ego cold and afraid then the words came unctuous and sonorous thundering over him in a foam of sound does your coffin fit differently lately why not try morbid m cadavers extensible caskets they are scientifically designed to fit the natural curves of the body and are enriched with vitamin b use cadavers caskets for comfort remember youre going to be dead a long long time it wasnt quite sound but whatever it was it died away in an oily rumbling whisper the white thread that might have been powell heaved uselessly at the insubstantial eons of time that existed all about him and collapsed upon itself as the piercing shriek of a hundred million ghosts of a hundred million soprano voices rose to a crescendo of melody ill be glad when youre dead you rascal you ill be glad when youre dead you rascal you ill be glad it rose up a spiral stairway of violent sound into the keening supersonics that passed hearing and then beyond the white thread quivered with a pulsating pang it strained quietly the voices were ordinary and many it was a crowd speaking a swirling mob that swept through and past and over him with a rapid headlong motion that left drifting tatters of words behind them what did they getcha for boy ylook banged up a hot fire i guess but i got a case ive made paradise but old st pete naaah i got a pull with the boy had dealings with him hey sam come this way ja get a mouthpiece beelzebub says going on my good imp my appointment is with sa and above it all the original stentorian roar that plunged across all hurry hurry hurry stir your bones and dont keep us waiting there are many more in line have your certificates ready and make sure peters release is stamped across it see if you are at the proper entrance gate there will be plenty of fire for all hey you you down there take your place in line or the white thread that was powell groveled backward before the advancing shout and felt the sharp stab of the pointing finger it all exploded into a rainbow of sound that dripped its fragments onto an aching brain powell was in the chair again he felt himself shaking donovans eyes were opening into two large popping bowls of glazed blue greg he whispered in what was almost a sob were you dead i felt dead he did not recognize his own croak donovan was obviously making a bad failure of his attempt to stand up are we alive now or is there more i feel alive it was the same hoarseness powell said cautiously did you hear anything when when you were dead donovan paused and then very slowly nodded his head did you yes did you hear about coffins and females singing and the lines forming to get into hell did you donovan shook his head just one voice loud no soft but rough like a file over the fingertips it was a sermon you know about hell fire he described the tortures of well you know i once heard a sermon like that almost he was perspiring they were conscious of sunlight through the port it was weak but it was blue white and the gleaming pea that was the distant source of light was not old sol and powell pointed a trembling finger at the single gauge the needle stood stiff and proud at the hairline whose figure read parsecs powell said mike if its true we must be out of the galaxy altogether donovan said blazed greg wed be the first men out of the solar system yes thats just it weve escaped the sun weve escaped the galaxy mike this ship is the answer it means freedom for all humanity freedom to spread through to every star that exists millions and billions and trillions of them and then he came down with a hard thud but how do we get back mike donovan smiled shakily oh thats all right the ship brought us here the ship will take us back me for more beans but mike hold on mike if it takes us back the way it brought us here donovan stopped halfway up and sat back heavily into the chair powell went on well have to die again mike well sighed donovan if we have to we have to at least it isnt permanent not very permanent susan calvin was speaking slowly now for six hours she had been slowly prodding the brain for six fruitless hours she was weary of repetitions weary of circumlocutions weary of everything now brain theres just one more thing you must make a special effort to answer simply have you been entirely clear about the interstellar jump i mean does it take them very far as far as they want to go miss susan golly it isnt any trick through the warp and on the other side what will they see stars and stuff what do you suppose the next question slipped out theyll be alive then sure and the interstellar jump wont hurt them she froze as the brain maintained silence that was it she had touched the sore spot brain she supplicated faintly brain do you hear me the answer was weak quivering the brain said do i have to answer about the jump i mean not if you dont want to but it would be interesting i mean if you wanted to susan calvin tried to be bright about it aw w w you spoil everything and the psychologist jumped up suddenly with a look of flaming insight on her face oh my she gasped oh my and she felt the tension of hours and days released in a burst it was later that she told lanning i tell you its all right no you must leave me alone now the ship will be back safely with the men and i want to rest i will rest now go away the ship returned to earth as silently as unjarringly as it had left it dropped precisely into place and the main lock gaped open the two men who walked out felt their way carefully and scratched their rough and scrubbily stubbled chins and then slowly and purposefully the one with red hair knelt down and planted upon the concrete of the runway a firm loud kiss they waved aside the crowd that was gathering and made gestures of denial at the eager couple that had piled out of the down swooping ambulance with a stretcher between them gregory powell said wheres the nearest shower they were led away they were gathered all of them about a table it was a full staff meeting of the brains of u s robot amp mechanical men corp slowly and climactically powell and donovan finished a graphic and resounding story susan calvin broke the silence that followed in the few days that had elapsed she bad recovered her icy somewhat acid calm but still a trace of embarrassment broke through strictly speaking she said this was my fault all of it when we first presented this problem to the brain as i hope some of you remember i went to great lengths to impress upon it the importance of rejecting any item of information capable of creating a dilemma in doing so i said something like dont get excited about the death of humans we dont mind it at all just give the sheet back and forget it hm m m said lanning what follows the obvious when that item entered its calculations which yielded the equation controlling the length of minimum interval for the interstellar jump it meant death for humans thats where consolidateds machine broke down completely but i had depressed the importance of death to the brain not entirely for the first law can never be broken but just sufficiently so that the brain could take a second look at the equation sufficiently to give it time to realize that after the interval was passed through the men would return to life just as the matter and energy of the ship itself would return to being this so called death in other words was a strictly temporary phenomenon you see she looked about her they were all listening she went on so he accepted the item but not without a certain jar even with death temporary and its importance depressed it was enough to unbalance him very gently she brought it out calmly he developed a sense of humor its an escape you see a method of partial escape from reality he became a practical joker powell and donovan were on their feet what cried powell donovan was considerably more colorful about it its so said calvin he took care of you and kept you safe but you couldnt handle any controls because they werent for you just for the humorous brain we could reach you by radio but you couldnt answer you had plenty of food but all of it beans and milk then you died so to speak and were reborn but the period of your death was made well interesting i wish i knew how he did it it was the brains prize joke but he meant no harm no harm gasped donovan oh if that cute little tyke only had a neck lanning raised a quieting hand all right its been a mess but its all over what now well said bogert quietly obviously its up to us to improve the space warp engine there must be some way of getting around that interval of jump if there is were the only organization left with a grand scale super robot so were bound to find it if anyone can and then u s robots has interstellar travel and humanity has the opportunity for galactic empire what about consolidated said lanning hey interrupted donovan suddenly i want to make a suggestion there they landed u s robots into quite a mess it wasnt as bad a mess as they expected and it turned out well but their intentions werent pious and greg and i bore the most of it well they wanted an answer and theyve got one send them that ship guaranteed and u s robots can collect their two hundred thou plus construction costs and if they test it then suppose we let the brain have just a little more fun before its brought back to normal lanning said gravely it sounds just and proper to me to which bogert added absently strictly according to contract too evidence but that wasnt it either said dr calvin thoughtfully oh eventually the ship and others like it became government property the jump through hyperspace was perfected and now we actually have human colonies on the planets of some of the nearer stars but that wasnt it i had finished eating and watched her through the smoke of my cigarette its what has happened to the people here on earth in the last fifty years that really counts when i was born young man we had just gone through the last world war it was a low point in history but it was the end of nationalism earth was too small for nations and they began grouping themselves into regions it took quite a while when i was born the united states of america was still a nation and not merely a part of the northern region in fact the name of the corporation is still united states robots and the change from nations to regions which has stabilized our economy and brought about what amounts to a golden age when this century is compared with the last was also brought about by our robots you mean the machines i said the brain you talked about was the first of the machines wasnt it yes it was but its not the machines i was thinking of rather of a man he died last year her voice was suddenly deeply sorrowful or at least he arranged to die because he knew we needed him no longer stephen byerley yes i guessed that was who you meant he first entered public office in you were only a boy then so you wouldnt remember the strangeness of it his campaign for the mayoralty was certainly the queerest in history francis quinn was a politician of the new school that of course is a meaningless expression as are all expressions of the sort most of the new schools we have were duplicated in the social life of ancient greece and perhaps if we knew more about it in the social life of ancient sumeria and in the lake dwellings of prehistoric switzerland as well but to get out from under what promises to be a dull and complicated beginning it might be best to state hastily that quinn neither ran for office nor canvassed for votes made no speeches and stuffed no ballot boxes any more than napoleon pulled a trigger at austerlitz and since politics makes strange bedfellows alfred lanning sat at the other side of the desk with his ferocious white eyebrows bent far forward over eyes in which chronic impatience had sharpened to acuity he was not pleased the fact if known to quinn would have annoyed him not the least his voice was friendly perhaps professionally so i assume you know stephen byerley dr lanning i have heard of him so have many people yes so have i perhaps you intend voting for him at the next election i couldnt say there was an unmistakable trace of acidity here i have not followed the political currents so im not aware that he is running for office he may be our next mayor of course he is only a lawyer now but great oaks yes interrupted lanning i have heard the phrase before but i wonder if we can get to the business at hand we are at the business at hand dr lanning quinns tone was very gentle it is to my interest to keep mr byerley a district attorney at the very most and it is to your interest to help me do so to my interest come lannings eyebrows hunched low well say then to the interest of the u s robot amp mechanical men corporation i come to you as director emeritus of research because i know that your connection to them is that of shall we say elder statesman you are listened to with respect and yet your connection with them is no longer so tight but that you cannot possess considerable freedom of action even if the action is somewhat unorthodox dr lanning was silent a moment chewing the cud of his thoughts he said more softly i dont follow you at all mr quinn i am not surprised dr lanning but its all rather simple do you mind quinn lit a slender cigarette with a lighter of tasteful simplicity and his big boned face settled into an expression of quiet amusement we have spoken of mr byerley a strange and colorful character he was unknown three years ago he is very well known now he is a man of force and ability and certainly the most capable and intelligent prosecutor i have ever known unfortunately he is not a friend of mine i understand said lanning mechanically he stared at his fingernails i have had occasion continued quinn evenly in the past year to investigate mr byerley quite exhaustively it is always useful you see to subject the past life of reform politicians to rather inquisitive research if you knew how often it helped he paused to smile humorlessly at the glowing tip of his cigarette but mr byerleys past is unremarkable a quiet life in a small town a college education a wife who died young an auto accident with a slow recovery law school coming to the metropolis an attorney francis quinn shook his head slowly then added but his present life ah that is remarkable our district attorney never eats lannings head snapped up old eyes surprisingly sharp pardon me our district attorney never eats the repetition thumped by syllables ill modify that slightly he has never been seen to eat or drink never do you understand the significance of the word not rarely but never i find that quite incredible can you trust your investigators i can trust my investigators and i dont find it incredible at all further our district attorney has never been seen to drink in the aqueous sense as well as the alcoholic nor to sleep there are other factors but i should think i have made my point lanning leaned back in his seat and there was the rapt silence of challenge and response between them and then the old roboticist shook his head no there is only one thing you can be trying to imply if i couple your statements with the fact that you present them to me and that is impossible but the man is quite inhuman dr lanning if you told me he were satan in masquerade there would be a faint chance that i might believe you i tell you he is a robot dr lanning i tell you it is as impossible a conception as i have ever heard mr quinn again the combative silence nevertheless and quinn stubbed out his cigarette with elaborate care you will have to investigate this impossibility with all the resources of the corporation im sure that i could undertake no such thing mr quinn you dont seriously suggest that the corporation take part in local politics you have no choice supposing i were to make my facts public without proof the evidence is circumstantial enough suit yourself in that respect but it would not suit me proof would be much preferable and it would not suit you for the publicity would be very damaging to your company you are perfectly well acquainted i suppose with the strict rules against the use of robots on inhabited worlds certainly brusquely you know that the u s robot amp mechanical men corporation is the only manufacturer of positronic robots in the solar system and if byerley is a robot he is a positronic robot you are also aware that all positronic robots are leased and not sold that the corporation remains the owner and manager of each robot and is therefore responsible for the actions of all it is an easy matter mr quinn to prove the corporation has never manufactured a robot of a humanoid character it can be done to discuss merely possibilities yes it can be done secretly i imagine as well without entering it in your books not the positronic brain sir too many factors are involved in that and there is the tightest possible government supervision yes but robots are worn out break down go out of order and are dismantled and the positronic brains re used or destroyed really francis quinn allowed himself a trace of sarcasm and if one were accidentally of course not destroyed and there happened to be a humanoid structure waiting for a brain impossible you would have to prove that to the government and the public so why not prove it to me now but what could our purpose be demanded lanning in exasperation where is our motivation credit us with a minimum of sense my dear sir please the corporation would be only too glad to have the various regions permit the use of humanoid positronic robots on inhabited worlds the profits would be enormous but the prejudice of the public against such a practice is too great suppose you get them used to such robots first see we have a skillful lawyer a good mayor and he is a robot wont you buy our robot butlers thoroughly fantastic an almost humorous descent to the ridiculous i imagine so why not prove it or would you still rather try to prove it to the public the light in the office was dimming but it was not yet too dim to obscure the flush of frustration on alfred lannings face slowly the roboticists finger touched a knob and the wall illuminators glowed to gentle life well then he growled let us see the face of stephen byerley is not an easy one to describe he was forty by birth certificate and forty by appearance but it was a healthy well nourished good natured appearance of forty one that automatically drew the teeth of the bromide about looking ones age this was particularly true when he laughed and he was laughing now it came loudly and continuously died away for a bit then began again and alfred lannings face contracted into a rigidly bitter monument of disapproval he made a half gesture to the woman who sat beside him but her thin bloodless lips merely pursed themselves a trifle byerley gasped himself a stage nearer normality really dr lanning really i i a robot lanning bit his words off with a snap it is no statement of mine sir i would be quite satisfied to have you a member of humanity since our corporation never manufactured you i am quite certain that you are in a legalistic sense at any rate but since the contention that you are a robot has been advanced to us seriously by a man of certain standing dont mention his name if it would knock a chip off your granite block of ethics but lets pretend it was frank quinn for the sake of argument and continue lanning drew in a sharp cutting snort at the interruption and paused ferociously before continuing with added frigidity by a man of certain standing with whose identity i am not interested in playing guessing games i am bound to ask your cooperation in disproving it the mere fact that such a contention could be advanced and publicized by the means at this mans disposal would be a bad blow to the company i represent even if the charge were never proven you understand me oh yes your position is clear to me the charge itself is ridiculous the spot you find yourself in is not i beg your pardon if my laughter offended you it was the first i laughed at not the second how can i help you it could be very simple you have only to sit down to a meal at a restaurant in the presence of witnesses have your picture taken and eat lanning sat back in his chair the worst of the interview over the woman beside him watched byerley with an apparently absorbed expression but contributed nothing of her own stephen byerley met her eyes for an instant was caught by them then turned back to the roboticist for a while his fingers were thoughtful over the bronze paper weight that was the only ornament on his desk he said quietly i dont think i can oblige you he raised his hand now wait dr lanning i appreciate the fact that this whole matter is distasteful to you that you have been forced into it against your will that you feel you are playing an undignified and even ridiculous part still the matter is even more intimately concerned with myself so be tolerant first what makes you think that quinn this man of certain standing you know wasnt hoodwinking you in order to get you to do exactly what you are doing why it seems scarcely likely that a reputable person would endanger himself in so ridiculous a fashion if he werent convinced he were on safe ground there was little humor in byerleys eyes you dont know quinn he could manage to make safe ground out of a ledge a mountain sheep could not handle i suppose be showed the particulars of the investigation he claims to have made of me enough to convince me that it would be too troublesome to have our corporation attempt to disprove them when you could do so more easily then you believe him when he says i never eat you are a scientist dr lanning think of the logic required i have not been observed to eat therefore i never eat q e d after all you are using prosecution tactics to confuse what is really a very simple situation on the contrary i am trying to clarify what you and quinn between you are making a very complicated one you see i dont sleep much thats true and i certainly dont sleep in public i have never cared to eat with others an idiosyncrasy which is unusual and probably neurotic in character but which harms no one look dr lanning let me present you with a suppositious case supposing we had a politician who was interested in defeating a reform candidate at any cost and while investigating his private life came across oddities such as i have just mentioned suppose further that in order to smear the candidate effectively he comes to your company as the ideal agent do you expect him to say to you so and so is a robot because he hardly ever eats with people and i have never seen him fall asleep in the middle of a case and once when i peeped into his window in the middle of the night there he was sitting up with a book and i looked in his frigidaire and there was no food in it if he told you that you would send for a straitjacket but if he tells you he never sleeps he never eats then the shock of the statement blinds you to the fact that such statements are impossible to prove you play into his hands by contributing to the to do regardless sir began lanning with a threatening obstinacy of whether you consider this matter serious or not it will require only the meal i mentioned to end it again byerley turned to the woman who still regarded him expressionlessly pardon me ive caught your name correctly havent i dr susan calvin yes mr byerley youre the u s robots psychologist arent you robopsychologist please oh are robots so different from men mentally worlds different she allowed herself a frosty smile robots are essentially decent humor tugged at the corners of the lawyers mouth well thats a hard blow but what i wanted to say was this since youre a psycho a robopsychologist and a woman ill bet that youve done something that dr lanning hasnt thought of and what is that youve got something to eat in your purse something caught in the schooled indifference of susan calvins eyes she said you surprise me mr byerley and opening her purse she produced an apple quietly she handed it to him dr lanning after an initial start followed the slow movement from one hand to the other with sharply alert eyes calmly stephen byerley bit into it and calmly he swallowed it you see dr lanning dr lanning smiled in a relief tangible enough to make even his eyebrows appear benevolent a relief that survived for one fragile second susan calvin said i was curious to see if you would eat it but of course in the present case it proves nothing byerley grinned it doesnt of course not it is obvious dr lanning that if this man were a humanoid robot he would be a perfect imitation he is almost too human to be credible after all we have been seeing and observing human beings all our lives it would be impossible to palm something merely nearly right off on us it would have to be all right observe the texture of the skin the quality of the irises the bone formation of the hand if hes a robot i wish u s robots had made him because hes a good job do you suppose then that anyone capable of paying attention to such niceties would neglect a few gadgets to take care of such things as eating sleeping elimination for emergency use only perhaps as for instance to prevent such situations as are arising here so a meal wont really prove anything now wait snarled lanning i am not quite the fool both of you make me out to be i am not interested in the problem of mr byerleys humanity or nonhumanity i am interest in getting the corporation out of a hole a public meal will end the matter and keep it ended no matter what quinn does we can leave the finer details to lawyers and robopsychologists but dr lanning said byerley you forget the politics of the situation i am as anxious to be elected as quinn is to stop me by the way did you notice that you used his name its a cheap shyster trick of mine i knew you would before you were through lanning flushed what has the election to do with it publicity works both ways sir if quinn wants to call me a robot and has the nerve to do so i have the nerve to play the game his way you mean you lanning was quite frankly appalled exactly i mean that im going to let him go ahead choose his rope test its strength cut off the right length tie the noose insert his head and grin i can do what little else is required you are mighty confident susan calvin rose to her feet come alfred we wont change his mind for him you see byerley smiled gently youre a human psychologist too but perhaps not all the confidence that dr lanning had remarked upon was present that evening when byerleys car parked on the automatic treads leading to the sunken garage and byerley himself crossed the path to the front door of his house the figure in the wheel chair looked up as he entered and smiled byerleys face lit with affection he crossed over to it the cripples voice was a hoarse grating whisper that came out of a mouth forever twisted to one side leering out of a face that was half scar tissue youre late steve i know john i know but ive been up against a peculiar and interesting trouble today so neither the torn face nor the destroyed voice could carry expression but there was anxiety in the clear eyes nothing you cant handle im not exactly certain i may need your help youre the brilliant one in the family do you want me to take you out into the garden its a beautiful evening two strong arms lifted john from the wheel chair gently almost caressingly byerleys arms went around the shoulders and under the swathed legs of the cripple carefully and slowly he walked through the rooms down the gentle ramp that had been built with a wheel chair in mind and out the back door into the walled and wired garden behind the house why dont you let me use the wheel chair steve this is silly because id rather carry you do you object you know that youre as glad to get out of that motorized buggy for a while as i am to see you out how do you feel today he deposited john with infinite care upon the cool grass how should i feel but tell me about your troubles quinns campaign will be based on the fact that he claims im a robot johns eyes opened wide how do you know its impossible i wont believe it oh come i tell you its so he had one of the big shot scientists of u s robot amp mechanical men corporation over at the office to argue with me slowly johns hands tore at the grass i see i see byerley said but we can let him choose his ground i have an idea listen to me and tell me if we can do it the scene as it appeared in alfred lannings office that night was a tableau of stares francis quinn stared meditatively at alfred lanning lannings stare was savagely set upon susan calvin who stared impassively in her turn at quinn francis quinn broke it with a heavy attempt at lightness bluff hes making it up as he goes along are you going to gamble on that mr quinn asked dr calvin indifferently well its your gamble really look here lanning covered definite pessimism with bluster weve done what you asked we witnessed the man eat its ridiculous to presume him a robot do you think so quinn shot toward calvin lanning said you were the expert lanning was almost threatening now susan quinn interrupted smoothly why not let her talk man shes been sitting there imitating a gatepost for half an hour lanning felt definitely harassed from what he experienced then to incipient paranoia was but a step he said very well have your say susan we wont interrupt you susan calvin glanced at him humorlessly then fixed cold eyes on mr quinn there are only two ways of definitely proving byerley to be a robot sir so far you are presenting circumstantial evidence with which you can accuse but not prove and i think mr byerley is sufficiently clever to counter that sort of material you probably think so yourself or you wouldnt have come here the two methods of proof are the physical and the psychological physically you can dissect him or use an x ray how to do that would be your problem psychologically his behavior can be studied for if he is a positronic robot he must conform to the three rules of robotics a positronic brain can not be constructed without them you know the rules mr quinn she spoke them carefully clearly quoting word for word the famous bold print on page one of the handbook of robotics ive heard of them said quinn carelessly then the matter is easy to follow responded the psychologist dryly if mr byerley breaks any of those three rules he is not a robot unfortunately this procedure works in only one direction if he lives up to the rules it proves nothing one way or the other quinn raised polite eyebrows why not doctor because if you stop to think of it the three rules of robotics are the essential guiding principles of a good many of the worlds ethical systems of course every human being is supposed to have the instinct of self preservation thats rule three to a robot also every good human being with a social conscience and a sense of responsibility is supposed to defer to proper authority to listen to his doctor his boss his government his psychiatrist his fellow man to obey laws to follow rules to conform to custom even when they interfere with his comfort or his safety thats rule two to a robot also every good human being is supposed to love others as himself protect his fellow man risk his life to save another thats rule one to a robot to put it simply if byerley follows all the rules of robotics he may be a robot and may simply be a very good man but said quinn youre telling me that you can never prove him a robot i may be able to prove him not a robot thats not the proof i want youll have such proof as exists you are the only one responsible for your own wants here lannings mind leaped suddenly to the sting of an idea has it occurred to anyone he ground out that district attorney is a rather strange occupation for a robot the prosecution of human beings sentencing them to death bringing about their infinite harm quinn grew suddenly keen no you cant get out of it that way being district attorney doesnt make him human dont you know his record dont you know that he boasts that he has never prosecuted an innocent man that there are scores of people left untried because the evidence against them didnt satisfy him even though he could probably have argued a jury into atomizing them that happens to be so tannings thin cheeks quivered no quinn no there is nothing in the rules of robotics that makes any allowance for human guilt a robot may not judge whether a human being deserves death it is not for him to decide he may not harm a human variety skunk or variety angel susan calvin sounded tired alfred she said dont talk foolishly what if a robot came upon a madman about to set fire to a house with people in it he would stop the madman wouldnt he of course and if the only way he could stop him was to kill him there was a faint sound in lannings throat nothing more the answer to that alfred is that he would do his best not to kill him if the madman died the robot would require psychotherapy because he might easily go mad at the conflict presented him of having broken rule one to adhere to rule one in a higher sense but a man would be dead and a robot would have killed him well is byerley mad demanded lanning with all the sarcasm he could muster no but he has killed no man himself he has exposed facts which might represent a particular human being to be dangerous to the large mass of other human beings we call society he protects the greater number and thus adheres to rule one at maximum potential that is as far as he goes it is the judge who then condemns the criminal to death or imprisonment after the jury decides on his guilt or innocence it is the jailer who imprisons him the executioner who kills him and mr byerley has done nothing but determine truth and aid society as a matter of fact mr quinn i have looked into mr byerleys career since you first brought this matter to our attention i find that he has never demanded the death sentence in his closing speeches to the jury i also find that he has spoken on behalf of the abolition of capital punishment and contributed generously to research institutions engaged in criminal neurophysiology he apparently believes in the cure rather than the punishment of crime i find that significant you do quinn smiled significant of a certain odor of roboticity perhaps perhaps why deny it actions such as his could come only from a robot or from a very honorable and decent human being but you see you just cant differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans quinn sat back in his chair his voice quivered with impatience dr lanning its perfectly possible to create a humanoid robot that would perfectly duplicate a human in appearance isnt it lanning harrumphed and considered its been done experimentally by u s robots he said reluctantly without the addition of a positronic brain of course by using human ova and hormone control one can grow human flesh and skin over a skeleton of porous silicone plastics that would defy external examination the eyes the hair the skin would be really human not humanoid and if you put a positronic brain and such other gadgets as you might desire inside you have a humanoid robot quinn said shortly how long would it take to make one lanning considered if you had all your equipment the brain the skeleton the ovum the proper hormones and radiations say two months the politician straightened out of his chair then we shall see what the insides of mr byerley look like it will mean publicity for u s robots but i gave you your chance lanning turned impatiently to susan calvin when they were alone why do you insist and with real feeling she responded sharply and instantly which do you want the truth or my resignation i wont lie for you u s robots can take care of itself dont turn coward what said lanning if he opens up byerley and wheels and gears fall out what then he wont open byerley said calvin disdainfully byerley is as clever as quinn at the very least the news broke upon the city a week before byerley was to have been nominated but broke is the wrong word it staggered upon the city shambled crawled laughter began and wit was free and as the far off hand of quinn tightened its pressure in easy stages the laughter grew forced an element of hollow uncertainty entered and people broke off to wonder the convention itself had the sir of a restive stallion there had been no contest planned only byerley could possibly have been nominated a week earlier there was no substitute even now they had to nominate him but there was complete confusion about it it would not have been so bad if the average individual were not torn between the enormity of the charge if true and its sensational folly if false the day after byerley was nominated perfunctorily hollowly a newspaper finally published the gist of a long interview with dr susan calvin world famous expert on robopsychology and positronics what broke loose is popularly and succinctly described as hell it was what the fundamentalists were waiting for they were not a political party they made pretense to no formal religion essentially they were those who had not adapted themselves to what had once been called the atomic age in the days when atoms were a novelty actually they were the simple lifers hungering after a life which to those who lived it had probably appeared not so simple and who had been therefore simple lifers themselves the fundamentalists required no new reason to detest robots and robot manufacturers but a new reason such as the quinn accusation and the calvin analysis was sufficient to make such detestation audible the huge plants of the u s robot amp mechanical men corporation was a hive that spawned armed guards it prepared for war within the city the house of stephen byerley bristled with police the political campaign of course lost all other issues and resembled a campaign only in that it was something filling the hiatus between nomination and election stephen byerley did not allow the fussy little man to distract him he remained comfortably unperturbed by the uniforms in the background outside the house past the line of grim guards reporters and photographers waited according to the tradition of the caste one enterprising visor station even had a scanner focused on the blank entrance to the prosecutors unpretentious home while a synthetically excited announcer filled in with inflated commentary the fussy little man advanced he held forward a rich complicated sheet this mr byerley is a court order authorizing me to search these premises for the presence of illegal uh mechanical men or robots of any description byerley half rose and took the paper he glanced at it indifferently and smiled as he handed it back all in order go ahead do your job mrs hoppen to his housekeeper who appeared reluctantly from the next room please go with them and help out if you can the little man whose name was harroway hesitated produced an unmistakable blush failed completely to catch byerleys eyes and muttered come on to the two policemen he was back in ten minutes through questioned byerley in just the tone of a person who is not particularly interested in the question or its answer harroway cleared his throat made a bad start in falsetto and began again angrily look here mr byerley our special instructions were to search the house very thoroughly and havent you we were told exactly what to look for yes in short mr byerley and not to put too fine a point on it we were told to search you me said the prosecutor with a broadening smile and how do you intend to do that we have a penet radiation unit then im to have my x ray photograph taken hey you have the authority you saw my warrant may i see it again harroway his forehead shining with considerably more than mere enthusiasm passed it over a second time byerley said evenly i read here as the description of what you are to search i quote the dwelling place belonging to stephen allen byerley located at willow grove evanstron together with any garage storehouse or other structures or buildings thereto appertaining together with all grounds thereto appertaining um and so on quite in order but my good man it doesnt say anything about searching my interior i am not part of the premises you may search my clothes if you think ive got a robot hidden in my pocket harroway had no doubt on the point of to whom he owed his job he did not propose to be backward given a chance to earn a much better i e more highly paid job he said in a faint echo of bluster look here im allowed to search the furniture in your house and anything else i find in it you are in it arent you a remarkable observation i am in it but im not a piece of furniture as a citizen of adult responsiblity i have the psychiatric certificate proving that i have certain rights under the regional articles searching me would come under the heading of violating my right of privacy that paper isnt sufficient sure but if youre a robot you dont have right of privacy true enough but that paper still isnt sufficient it recognizes me implicitly as a human being where harroway snatched at it where it says the dwelling place belonging to and so on a robot cannot own property and you may tell your employer mr harroway that if he tries to issue a similar paper which does not implicitly recognize me as a human being he will be immediately faced with a restraining injunction and a civil suit which will make it necessary for him to prove me a robot by means of information now in his possession or else to pay a whopping penalty for an attempt to deprive me unduly of my rights under the regional articles youll tell him that wont you harroway marched to the door he turned youre a slick lawyer his hand was in his pocket for a short moment he stood there then he left smiled in the direction of the visor scanner still playing away waved to the reporters and shouted well have something for you tomorrow boys no kidding in his ground car he settled back removed the tiny mechanism from his pocket and carefully inspected it it was the first time he had ever taken a photograph by x ray reflection he hoped he had done it correctly quinn and byerley had never met face to face alone but visorphone was pretty close to it in fact accepted literally perhaps the phrase was accurate even if to each the other were merely the light and dark pattern of a bank of photocells it was quinn who had initiated the call it was quinn who spoke first and without particular ceremony thought you would like to know byerley that i intend to make public the fact that youre wearing a protective shield against penet radiation that so in that case youve probably already made it public i have a notion our enterprising press representatives have been tapping my various communication lines for quite a while i know they have my office lines full of holes which is why ive dug in at my home these last weeks byerley was friendly almost chatty quinns lips tightened slightly this call is shielded thoroughly im making it at a certain personal risk so i should imagine nobody knows youre behind this campaign at least nobody knows it officially nobody doesnt know it unofficially i wouldnt worry so i wear a protective shield i suppose you found that out when your puppy dogs penet radiation photograph the other day turned out to be overexposed you realize byerley that it would be pretty obvious to everyone that you dont dare face x ray analysis also that you or your men attempted illegal invasion of my rights of privacy the devil theyll care for that they might its rather symbolic of our two campaigns isnt it you have little concern with the rights of the individual citizen i have great concern i will not submit to x ray analysis because i wish to maintain my rights on principle just as ill maintain the rights of others when elected that will no doubt make a very interesting speech but no one will believe you a little too high sounding to be true another thing a sudden crisp change the personnel in your home was not complete the other night in what way according to the report he shuffled papers before him that were just within the range of vision of the visiplate there was one person missing a cripple as you say said byerley tonelessly a cripple my old teacher who lives with me and who is now in the country and has been for two months a much needed rest is the usual expression applied in the case he has your permission your teacher a scientist of sorts a lawyer once before he was a cripple he has a government license as a research biophysicist with a laboratory of his own and a complete description of the work hes doing filed with the proper authorities to whom i can refer you the work is minor but is a harmless and engaging hobby for a poor cripple i am being as helpful as i can you see i see and what does this teacher know about robot manufacture i couldnt judge the extent of his knowledge in a field with which i am unacquainted he wouldnt have access to positronic brains ask your friends at u s robots theyd be the ones to know ill put it shortly byerley your crippled teacher is the real stephen byerley you are his robot creation we can prove it it was he who was in the automobile accident not you there will be ways of checking the records really do so then my best wishes and we can search your so called teachers country place and see what we can find there well not quite quinn byerley smiled broadly unfortunately for you my so called teacher is a sick man his country place is his place of rest his right of privacy as a citizen of adult responsibility is naturally even stronger under the circumstances you wont be able to obtain a warrant to enter his grounds without showing just cause however id be the last to prevent you from trying there was a pause of moderate length and then quinn leaned forward so that his imaged face expanded and the fine lines on his forehead were visible byerley why do you carry on you cant be elected cant i do you think you can do you suppose that your failure to make any attempt to disprove the robot charge when you could easily by breaking one of the three laws does anything but convince the people that you are a robot all i see so far is that from being a rather vaguely known but still largely obscure metropolitan lawyer i have now become a world figure youre a good publicist but you are a robot so its been said but not proven its been proven sufficiently for the electorate then relax youve won good by said quinn with his first touch of viciousness and the visorphone slammed off good by said byerley imperturbably to the blank plate byerley brought his teacher back the week before election the air car dropped quickly in an obscure part of the city youll stay here till after election byerley told him it would be better to have you out of the way if things take a bad turn the hoarse voice that twisted painfully out of johns crooked mouth might have had accents of concern in it theres danger of violence the fundamentalists threaten it so i suppose there is in a theoretical sense but i really dont expect it the fundies have no real power theyre just the continuous irritant factor that might stir up a riot after a while you dont mind staying here please i wont be myself if i have to worry about you oh ill stay you still think it will go well im sure of it no one bothered you at the place no one im certain and your part went well well enough therell be no trouble there then take care of yourself and watch the televisor tomorrow john byerley pressed the gnarled hand that rested on his lentons forehead was a furrowed study in suspense he had the completely unenviable job of being byerleys campaign manager in a campaign that wasnt a campaign for a person that refused to reveal his strategy and refused to accept his managers you cant it was his favorite phrase it had become his only phrase i tell you steve you cant he threw himself in front of the prosecutor who was spending his time leafing through the typed pages of his speech put that down steve look that mob has been organized by the fundies you wont get a hearing youll be stoned more likely why do you have to make a speech before an audience whats wrong with a recording a visual recording you want me to win the election dont you asked byerley mildly win the election youre not going to win steve im trying to save your life oh im not in danger hes not in danger hes not in danger lenton made a queer rasping sound in his throat you mean youre getting out on that balcony in front of fifty thousand crazy crackpots and try to talk sense to them on a balcony like a medieval dictator byerley consulted his watch in about five minutes as soon as the televison lines are free lentons answering remark was not quite transliterable the crowd filled a roped off area of the city trees and houses seemed to grow out of a mass human foundation and by ultra wave the rest of the world watched it was a purely local election but it had a world audience just the same byerley thought of that and smiled but there was nothing to smile at in the crowd itself there were banners and streamers ringing every possible change on his supposed robotcy the hostile attitude rose thickly and tangibly into the atmosphere from the start the speech was not successful it competed against the inchoate mob howl and the rhythmic cries of the fundie claques that formed mob islands within the mob byerley spoke on slowly unemotionally inside lenton clutched his hair and groaned and waited for the blood there was a writhing in the front ranks an angular citizen with popping eyes and clothes too short for the lank length of his limbs was pulling to the fore a policeman dived after him making slow struggling passage byerley waved the latter off angrily the thin man was directly under the balcony his words tore unheard against the roar byerley leaned forward what do you say if you have a legitimate question ill answer it he turned to a flanking guard bring that man up here there was a tensing in the crowd cries of quiet started in various parts of the mob and rose to a bedlam then toned down raggedly the thin man red faced and panting faced byerley byerley said have you a question the thin man stared and said in a cracked voice hit me with sudden energy he thrust out his chin at an angle hit me you say youre not a robot prove it you cant hit a human you monster there was a queer flat dead silence byerleys voice punctured it i have no reason to hit you the thin man was laughing wildly you cant hit me you wont hit me youre not a human youre a monster a make believe man and stephen byerley tight lipped in the face of thousands who watched in person and the millions who watched by screen drew back his fist and caught the man crackingly upon the chin the challenger went over backwards in sudden collapse with nothing on his face but blank blank surprise byerley said im sorry take him in and see that hes comfortable i want to speak to him when im through and when dr calvin from her reserved space turned her automobile and drove off only one reporter had recovered sufficiently from the shock to race after her and shout an unheard question susan calvin called over her shoulder hes human that was enough the reporter raced away in his own direction the rest of the speech might be described as spoken but not heard dr calvin and stephen byerley met once again a week before he took the oath of office as mayor it was late past midnight dr calvin said you dont look tired the mayor elect smiled i may stay up for a while dont tell quinn i shant but that was an interesting story of quinns since you mention him its a shame to have spoiled it i suppose you knew his theory parts of it it was highly dramatic stephen byerley was a young lawyer a powerful speaker a great idealist and with a certain flair for biophysics are you interested in robotics mr byerley only in the legal aspects this stephen byerley was but there was an accident byerleys wife died he himself worse his legs were gone his face was gone his voice was gone part of his mind was bent he would not submit to plastic surgery he retired from the world legal career gone only his intelligence and his hands left somehow he could obtain positronic brains even a complex one one which had the greatest capacity of forming judgments in ethical problems which is the highest robotic function so far developed he grew a body about it trained it to be everything he would have been and was no longer he sent it out into the world as stephen byerley remaining behind himself as the old crippled teacher that no one ever saw unfortunately said the mayor elect i ruined all that by hitting a man the papers say it was your official verdict on the occasion that i was human how did that happen do you mind telling me it couldnt have been accidental it wasnt entirely quinn did most of the work my men started quietly spreading the fact that i had never hit a man that i was unable to hit a man that to fail to do so under provocation would be sure proof that i was a robot so i arranged for a silly speech in public with all sorts of publicity overtones and almost inevitably some fool fell for it in its essence it was what i call a shyster trick one in which the artificial atmosphere which has been created does all the work of course the emotional effects made my election certain as intended the robopsychologist nodded i see you intrude on my field as every politician must i suppose but im very sorry it turned out this way i like robots i like them considerably better than i do human beings if a robot can be created capable of being a civil executive i think hed make the best one possible by the laws of robotics hed be incapable of harming humans incapable of tyranny of corruption of stupidity of prejudice and after he had served a decent term he would leave even though he were immortal because it would be impossible for him to hurt humans by letting them know that a robot had ruled them it would be most ideal except that a robot might fail due to the inherent inadequacies of his brain the positronic brain has never equalled the complexities of the human brain he would have advisers not even a human brain is capable of governing without assistance byerley considered susan calvin with grave interest why do you smile dr calvin i smile because mr quinn didnt think of everything you mean there could be more to that story of his only a little for the three months before election this stephen byerley that mr quinn spoke about this broken man was in the country for some mysterious reason he returned in time for that famous speech of yours and after all what the old cripple did once he could do a second time particularly where the second job is very simple in comparison to the first i dont quite understand dr calvin rose and smoothed her dress she was obviously ready to leave i mean there is one time when a robot may strike a human being without breaking the first law just one time and when is that dr calvin was at the door she said quietly when the human to be struck is merely another robot she smiled broadly her thin face glowing good by mr byerley i hope to vote for you five years from now for co ordinator stephen byerley chuckled i must reply that that is a somewhat farfetched idea the door closed behind her i stared at her with a sort of horror is that true all of it she said and the great byerley was simply a robot oh theres no way of ever finding out i think he was but when he decided to die he had himself atomized so that there will never be any legal proof besides what difference would it make well you share a prejudice against robots which is quite unreasoning he was a very good mayor five years later he did become regional co ordinator and when the regions of earth formed their federation in he became the first world co ordinator by that time it was the machines that were running the world anyway yes but no buts the machines are robots and they are running the world it was five years ago that i found out all the truth it was byerley was completing his second term as world co ordinator the evitable conflict the co ordinator in his private study had that medieval curiosity a fireplace to be sure the medieval man might not have recognized it as such since it had no functional significance the quiet licking flame lay in an insulated recess behind clear quartz the logs were ignited at long distance through a trifling diversion of the energy beam that fed the public buildings of the city the same button that controlled the ignition first dumped the ashes of the previous fire and allowed for the entrance of fresh wood it was a thoroughly domesticated fireplace you see but the fire itself was real it was wired for sound so that you could hear the crackle and of course you could watch it leap in the air stream that fed it the co ordinators ruddy glass reflected in miniature the discreet gamboling of the flame and in even further miniature it was reflected in each of his brooding pupils and in the frosty pupils of his guest dr susan calvin of u s robots amp mechanical men corporation the co ordinator said i did not ask you here entirely for social purposes susan i did not think you did stephen she replied and yet i dont quite know how to phrase my problem on the one hand it can be nothing at all on the other it can mean the end of humanity i have come across so many problems stephen that presented the same alternative i think all problems do really then judge this world steel reports an overproduction of twenty thousand long tons the mexican canal is two months behind schedule the mercury mines at almaden have experienced a production deficiency since last spring while the hydroponics plant at tientsin has been laying men off these items happen to come to mind at the moment there is more of the same sort are these things serious im not economist enough to trace the fearful consequences of such things in themselves they are not serious mining experts can be sent to almaden if the situation were to get worse hydroponics engineers can be used in java or in ceylon if there are too many at tientsin twenty thousand long tons of steel wont fill more than a few days of world demand and the opening of the mexican canal two months later than the planned date is of little moment its the machines that worry me ive spoken to your director of research about them already to vincent silver he hasnt mentioned anything about it to me i asked him to speak to no one apparently he hasnt and what did he tell you let me put that item in its proper place i want to talk about the machines first and i want to talk about them to you because youre the only one in the world who understands robots well enough to help me now may i grow philosophical for this evening stephen you may talk how you please and of what you please provided you tell me first what you intend to prove that such small unbalances in the perfection of our system of supply and demand as i have mentioned may be the first step towards the final war hmp proceed susan calvin did not allow herself to relax despite the designed comfort of the chair she sat in her cold thin lipped face and her flat even voice were becoming accentuated with the years and although stephen byerley was one man she could like and trust she was almost seventy and the cultivated habits of a lifetime are not easily broken every period of human development susan said the co ordinator has had its own particular type of human conflict its own variety of problem that apparently could be settled only by force and each time frustratingly enough force never really settled the problem instead it persisted through a series of conflicts then vanished of itself whats the expression ah yes not with a bang but a whimper as the economic and social environment changed and then new problems and a new series of wars apparently endlessly cyclic consider relatively modern times there were the series of dynastic wars in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries when the most important question in europe was whether the houses of hapsburg or valois bourbon were to rule the continent it was one of those inevitable conflicts since europe could obviously not exist half one and half the other except that it did and no war ever wiped out the one and established the other until the rise of a new social atmosphere in france in tumbled first the bourbons and eventually the hapsburgs down the dusty chute to historys incinerator and in those same centuries there were the more barbarous religious wars which revolved about the important question of whether europe was to be catholic or protestant half and half she could not be it was inevitable that the sword decide except that it didnt in england a new industrialism was growing and on the continent a new nationalism half and half europe remains to this day and no one cares much in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was a cycle of nationalist imperialist wars when the most important question in the world was which portions of europe would control the economic resources and consuming capacity of which portions of non europe all non europe obviously could not exist part english and part french and part german and so on until the forces of nationalism spread sufficiently so that non europe ended what all the wars could not and decided it could exist quite comfortably all non european and so we have a pattern yes stephen you make it plain said susan calvin these are not very profound observations no but then it is the obvious which is so difficult to see most of the time people say its as plain as the nose on your face but how much of the nose on your face can you see unless someone holds a mirror up to you in the twentieth century susan we started a new cycle of wars what shall i call them ideological wars the emotions of religion applied to economic systems rather than to extra natural ones again the wars were inevitable and this time there were atomic weapons so that mankind could no longer live through its torment to the inevitable wasting away of inevitability and positronic robots came they came in time and with it and alongside it interplanetary travel so that it no longer seemed so important whether the world was adam smith or karl marx neither made very much sense under the new circumstances both had to adapt and they ended in almost the same place a deus ex machina then in a double sense said dr calvin dryly the co ordinator smiled gently i have never heard you pun before susan but you are correct and yet there was another danger the ending of every other problem had merely given birth to another our new world wide robot economy may develop its own problems and for that reason we have the machines the earths economy is stable and will remain stable because it is based upon the decisions of calculating machines that have the good of humanity at heart through the overwhelming force of the first law of robotics stephen byerley continued and although the machines are nothing but the vastest conglomeration of calculating circuits ever invented they are still robots within the meaning of the first law and so our earth wide economy is in accord with the best interests of man the population of earth knows that there will be no unemployment no over production or shortages waste and famine are words in history books and so the question of ownership of the means of production becomes obsolescent whoever owned them if such a phrase has meaning a man a group a nation or all mankind they could be utilized only as the machines directed not because men were forced to but because it was the wisest course and men knew it it puts an end to war not only to the last cycle of wars but to the next and to all of them unless a long pause and dr calvin encouraged him by repetition unless the fire crouched and skittered along a log then popped up unless said the co ordinator the machines dont fulfill their function i see and that is where those trifling maladjustments come in which you mentioned awhile ago steel hydroponics and so on exactly those errors should not be dr silver tells me they cannot be does he deny the facts how unusual no he admits the facts of course i do him an injustice what he denies is that any error in the machine is responsible for the so called his phrase errors in the answers he claims that the machines are self correcting and that it would violate the fundamental laws of nature for an error to exist in the circuits of relays and so i said and you said have your boys check them and make sure anyway susan you read my mind it was what i said and he said he couldnt too busy no he said that no human could he was frank about it he told me and i hope i understand him properly that the machines are a gigantic extrapolation thus a team of mathematicians work several years calculating a positronic brain equipped to do certain similar acts of calculation using this brain they make further calculations to create a still more complicated brain which they use again to make one still more complicated and so on according to silver what we call the machines are the result of ten such steps ye es that sounds familiar fortunately im not a mathematician poor vincent he is a young man the directors before him alfred lanning and peter bogert are dead and they had no such problems nor had i perhaps roboticists as a whole should now die since we can no longer understand our own creations apparently not the machines are not super brains in sunday supplement sense although they are so pictured in the sunday supplements it is merely that in their own particular province of collecting and analyzing a nearly infinite number of data and relationships thereof in nearly infinitesimal time they have progressed beyond the possibility of detailed human control and then i tried something else i actually asked the machine in the strictest secrecy we fed it the original data involved in the steel decision its own answer and the actual developments since the overproduction that is and asked for an explanation of the discrepancy good and what was its answer i can quote you that word for word the matter admits of no explanation and how did vincent interpret that in two ways either we had not given the machine enough data to allow a definite answer which was unlikely dr silver admitted that or else it was impossible for the machine to admit that it could give any answer to data which implied that it could harm a human being this naturally is implied by the first law and then dr silver recommended that i see you susan calvin looked very tired im old stephen when peter bogert died they wanted to make me director of research and i refused i wasnt young then either and i did not wish the responsibility they let young silver have it and that satisfied me but what good is it if i am dragged into such messes stephen let me state my position my researches do indeed involve the interpretation of robot behavior in the light of the three laws of robotics here now we have these incredible calculating machines they are positronic robots and therefore obey the laws of robotics but they lack personality that is their functions are extremely limited must be since they are so specialized therefore there is very little room for the interplay of the laws and my one method of attack is virtually useless in short i dont know that i can help you stephen the co ordinator laughed shortly nevertheless let me tell you the rest let me give you my theories and perhaps you will then be able to tell me whether they are possible in the light of robopsychology by all means go ahead well since the machines are giving the wrong answers then assuming that they cannot be in error there is only one possibility they are being given the wrong data in other words the trouble is human and not robotic so i took my recent planetary inspection tour from which you have just returned to new york yes it was necessary you see since there are four machines one handling each of the planetary regions and all four are yielding imperfect results oh but that follows stephen if any one of the machines is imperfect that will automatically reflect in the result of the other three since each of the others will assume as part of the data on which they base their own decisions the perfection of the imperfect fourth with a false assumption they will yield false answers uh huh so it seemed to me now i have here the records of my interviews with each of the regional vice coordinators would you look through them with me oh and first have you heard of the society for humanity umm yes they are an outgrowth of the fundamentalists who have kept u s robots from ever employing positronic robots on the grounds of unfair labor competition and so on the society for humanity itself is anti machine is it not yes yes but well you will see shall we begin well start with the eastern region as you say the eastern region a area square miles b population c capital shanghai ching hso lins great grandfather had been killed in the japanese invasion of the old chinese republic and there had been no one beside his dutiful children to mourn his loss or even to know he was lost ching hso lins grandfather had survived the civil war of the late forties but there had been no one beside his dutiful children to know or care of that and yet ching hso lin was a regional vice co ordinator with the economic welfare of half the people of earth in his care perhaps it was with the thought of all that in mind that ching had two maps as the only ornaments on the wall of his office one was an old hand drawn affair tracing out an acre or two of land and marked with the now outmoded pictographs of old china a little creek trickled aslant the faded markings and there were the delicate pictorial indications of lowly huts in one of which chings grandfather had been born the other map was a huge one sharply delineated with all markings in neat cyrillic characters the red boundary that marked the eastern region swept within its grand confines all that had once been china india burma indo china and indonesia on it within the old province of szechuan so light and gentle that none could see it was the little mark placed there by ching which indicated the location of his ancestral farm ching stood before these maps as he spoke to stephen byerley in precise english no one knows better than you mr co ordinator that my job to a large extent is a sinecure it carries with it a certain social standing and i represent a convenient focal point for administration but otherwise it is the machine the machine does all the work what did you think for instance of the tientsin hydroponics works tremendous said byerley it is but one of dozens and not the largest shanghai calcutta batavia bangkok they are widely spread and they are the answer to feeding the billion and three quarters of the east and yet said byerley you have an unemployment problem there at tientsin can you be over producing it is incongruous to think of asia as suffering from too much food chings dark eyes crinkled at the edges no it has not come to that yet it is true that over the last few months several vats at tientsin have been shut down but it is nothing serious the men have been released only temporarily and those who do not care to work in other fields have been shipped to colombo in ceylon where a new plant is being put into operation but why should the vats be closed down ching smiled gently you do not know much of hydroponics i see well that is not surprising you are a northerner and there soil farming is still profitable it is fashionable in the north to think of hydroponics when it is thought of at all as a device of growing turnips in a chemical solution and so it is in an infinitely complicated way in the first place by far the largest crop we deal with and the percentage is growing is yeast we have upward of two thousand strains of yeast in production and new strains are added monthly the basic food chemicals of the various yeasts are nitrates and phosphates among the inorganics together with proper amounts of the trace metals needed down to the fractional parts per million of boron and molybdenum which are required the organic matter is mostly sugar mixtures derived from the hydrolysis of cellulose but in addition there are various food factors which must be added for a successful hydroponics industry one which can feed seventeen hundred million people we must engage in an immense reforestation program throughout the east we must have huge wood conversion plants to deal with our southern jungles we must have power and steel and chemical synthetics above all why the last sir because mr byerley these strains of yeast have each their peculiar properties we have developed as i said two thousand strains the beef steak you thought you ate today was yeast the frozen fruit confection you had for dessert was iced yeast we have filtered yeast juice with the taste appearance and all the food value of milk it is flavor more than anything else you see that makes yeast feeding popular and for the sake of flavor we have developed artificial domesticated strains that can no longer support themselves on a basic diet of salts and sugar one needs biotin another needs pteroylglutamic acid still others need seventeen different amino acids supplied them as well as all the vitamins b but one and yet it is popular and we cannot with economic sense abandon it byerley stirred in his seat to what purpose do you tell me all this you asked me sir why men are out of work in tientsin i have a little more to explain it is not only that we must have these various and varying foods for our yeast but there remains the complicating factor of popular fads with passing time and of the possibility of the development of new strains with the new requirements and new popularity all this must be foreseen and the machine does the job but not perfectly not very imperfectly in view of the complications i have mentioned well then a few thousand workers in tientsin are temporarily out of a job but consider this the amount of waste in this past year waste that is in terms of either defective supply or defective demand amounts to not one tenth of one percent of our total productive turnover i consider that yet in the first years of the machine the figure was nearer onethousandth of one percent ah but in the decade since the machine began its operations in real earnest we have made use of it to increase our old pre machine yeast industry twenty fold you expect imperfections to increase with complications though though there was the curious instance of rama vrasayana what happened to him vrasayana was in charge of a brine evaporation plant for the production of iodine with which yeast can do without but human beings not his plant was forced into receivership really and through what agency competition believe it or not in general one of the chiefest functions of the machines analyses is to indicate the most efficient distribution of our producing units it is obviously faulty to have areas insufficiently serviced so that the transportation costs account for too great a percentage of the overhead similarly it is faulty to have an area too well serviced so that factories must be run at lowered capacities or else compete harmfully with one another in the case of vrasayana another plant was established in the same city and with a more efficient extracting system the machine permitted it oh certainly that is not surprising the new system is becoming widespread the surprise is that the machine failed to warn vrasayana to renovate or combine still no matter vrasayana accepted a job as engineer in the new plant and if his responsibility and pay are now less he is not actually suffering the workers found employment easily the old plant has been converted to something or other something useful we left it all to the machine and otherwise you have no complaints none the tropic region a area square miles b population c capital capital city the map in lincoln ngomas office was far from the model of neat precision of the one in chings shanghai dominion the boundaries of ngomas tropic region were stencilled in dark wide brown and swept about a gorgeous interior labelled jungle and desert and here be elephants and all manner of strange beasts it had much to sweep for in land area the tropic region enclosed most of two continents all of south america north of argentina and all of africa south of the atlas it included north america south of the rio grande as well and even arabia and iran in asia it was the reverse of the eastern region where the ant hives of the orient crowded half of humanity into per cent of the land mass the tropics stretched its per cent of humanity over nearly half of all the land in the world but it was growing it was the one region whose population increase through immigration exceeded that through births and for all who came it had use to ngoma stephen byerley seemed like one of these immigrants a pale searcher for the creative work of carving a harsh environment into the softness necessary for man and he felt some of that automatic contempt of the strong man born to the strong tropics for the unfortunate pallards of the colder suns the tropics had the newest capital city on earth and it was called simply that capital city in the sublime confidence of youth it spread brightly over the fertile uplands of nigeria and outside ngomas windows far below was life and color the bright bright sun and the quick drenching showers even the squawking of the rainbowed birds was brisk and the stars were hard pinpoints in the sharp night ngoma laughed he was a big dark man strong faced and handsome sure he said and his english was colloquial and mouthfilling the mexican canal is overdue what the hell it will get finished just the same old boy it was doing well up to the last half year ngoma looked at byerley and slowly crunched his teeth over the end of a big cigar spitting out one end and lighting the other is this an official investigation byerley whats going on nothing nothing at all its just my function as coordinator to be curious well if its just that you are filling in a dull moment the truth is that were always short on labor theres lots going on in the tropics the canal is only one of them but doesnt your machine predict the amount of labor available for the canal allowing for all the competing projects ngoma placed one hand behind his neck and blew smoke rings at the ceiling it was a little off is it often a little off not oftener than you would expect we dont expect too much of it byerley we feed it data we take its results we do what it says but its just a convenience just a labor saving device we could do without it if we had to maybe not as well maybe not as quickly but wed get there weve got confidence out here byerley and thats the secret confidence weve got new land thats been waiting for us for thousands of years while the rest of the world was being ripped apart in the lousy fumblings of pre atomic time we dont have to eat yeast like the eastern boys and we dont have to worry about the stale dregs of the last century like you northerners weve wiped out the tsetse fly and the anopheles mosquito and people find they can live in the sun and like it now weve thinned down the jungles and found soil weve watered the deserts and found gardens weve got coal and oil in untouched fields and minerals out of count just step back thats all we ask the rest of the world to do step back and let us work byerley said prosaically but the canal it was on schedule six months ago what happened ngoma spread his hands labor troubles he felt through a pile of papers skeltered about his desk and gave it up had something on the matter here he muttered but never mind there was a work shortage somewhere in mexico once on the question of women there werent enough women in the neighborhood it seemed no one had thought of feeding sexual data to the machine he stopped to laugh delightedly then sobered wait a while i think ive got it villafranca villafranca francisco villafranca he was the engineer in charge now let me straighten it out something happened and there was a cave in right right that was it nobody died as i remember but it made a hell of a mess quite a scandal oh there was some mistake in his calculations or at least the machine said so they fed through villafrancas data assumptions and so on the stuff he had started with the answers came out differently it seems the answers villafranca had used didnt take account of the effect of a heavy rainfall on the contours of the cut or something like that im not an engineer you understand anyway villafranca put up a devil of a squawk he claimed the machines answer had been different the first time that he had followed the machine faithfully then he quit we offered to hold him on reasonable doubt previous work satisfactory and all that in a subordinate position of course had to do that much mistakes cant go unnoticed bad for discipline where was i you offered to hold him on oh yes he refused well take all in all were two months behind hell thats nothing byerley stretched out his hand and let the fingers tap lightly on the desk villafranca blamed the machine did he well he wasnt going to blame himself was he lets face it human nature is an old friend of ours besides i remember something else now why the hell cant i find documents when i want them my filing system isnt worth a damn this villafranca was a member of one of your northern organizations mexico is too close to the north thats part of the trouble which organization are you speaking of the society of humanity they call it he used to attend the annual conference in new york villafranca did bunch of crackpots but harmless they dont like the machines claim theyre destroying human initiative so naturally villafranca would blame the machine dont understand that group myself does capital city look as if the human race were running out of initiative and capital city stretched out in golden glory under a golden sun the newest and youngest creation of homo metropolis the european region a area square miles b population c capital geneva the european region was an anomaly in several ways in area it was far the smallest not one fifth the size of the tropic region in area and not one fifth the size of the eastern region in population geographically it was only somewhat similar to pre atomic europe since it excluded what had once been european russia and what had once been the british isles while it included the mediterranean coasts of africa and asia and in a queer jump across the atlantic argentina chile and uruguay as well nor was it likely to improve its relative status vis a vis the other regions of earth except for what vigor the south american provinces lent it of all the regions it alone showed a positive population decline over the past half century it alone had not seriously expanded its productive facilities or offered anything radically new to human culture europe said madame szegeczowska in her soft french is essentially an economic appendage of the northern region we know it and it doesnt matter and as though in resigned acceptance of a lack of individuality there was no map of europe on the wall of the madame co ordinators office and yet pointed out byerley you have a machine of your own and you are certainly under no economic pressure from across the ocean a machine bah she shrugged her delicate shoulders and allowed a thin smile to cross her little face as she tamped out a cigarette with long fingers europe is a sleepy place and such of our men as do not manage to emigrate to the tropics are tired and sleepy along with it you see for yourself that it is myself a poor woman to whom falls the task of being vice co ordinator well fortunately it is not a difficult job and not much is expected of me as for the machine what can it say but do this and it will be best for you but what is best for us why to be an economic appendage of the northern region and is it so terrible no wars we live in peace and it is pleasant after seven thousand years of war we are old monsieur in our borders we have the regions where occidental civilization was cradled we have egypt and mesopotamia crete and syria asia minor and greece but old age is not necessarily an unhappy time it can be a fruition perhaps you are right said byerley affably at least the tempo of life is not as intense as in the other regions it is a pleasant atmosphere is it not tea is being brought monsieur if you will indicate your cream and sugar preference please thank you she sipped gently then continued it is pleasant the rest of earth is welcome to the continuing struggle i find a parallel here a very interesting one there was a time when rome was master of the world it had adopted the culture and civilization of greece a greece which had never been united which had ruined itself with war and which was ending in a state of decadent squalor rome united it brought it peace and let it live a life of secure non glory it occupied itself with its philosophies and its art far from the clash of growth and war it was a sort of death but it was restful and it lasted with minor breaks for some four hundred years and yet said byerley rome fell eventually and the opium dream was over there are no longer barbarians to overthrow civilization we can be our own barbarians madame szegeczowska oh i meant to ask you the almaden mercury mines have fallen off quite badly in production surely the ores are not declining more rapidly than anticipated the little womans gray eyes fastened shrewdly on byerley barbarians the fall of civilization possible failure of the machine your thought processes are very transparent monsieur are they byerley smiled i see that i should have had men to deal with as hitherto you consider the almaden affair to be the fault of the machine not at all but i think you do you yourself are a native of the northern region the central co ordination office is at new york and i have noticed for quite a while that you northerners lack somewhat of faith in the machine we do there is your society for humanity which is strong in the north but naturally fails to find many recruits in tired old europe which is quite willing to let feeble humanity alone for a while surely you are one of the confident north and not one of the cynical old continent this has a connection with almaden oh yes i think so the mines are in the control of consolidated cinnabar which is certainly a northern company with headquarters at nikolaev personally i wonder if the board of directors have been consulting the machine at all they said they had in our conference last month and of course we have no evidence that they did not but i wouldnt take the word of a northerner in this matter no offense intended under any circumstances nevertheless i think it will have a fortunate ending in what way my dear madam you must understand that the economic irregularities of the last few months which although small as compared with the great storms of the past are quite disturbing to our peace drenched spirits have caused considerable restiveness in the spanish province i understand that consolidated cinnabar is selling out to a group of native spaniards it is consoling if we are economic vassals of the north it is humiliating to have the fact advertised too blatantly and our people can be better trusted to follow the machine then you think there will be no more trouble i am sure there will not be in almaden at least the northern region a area square miles b population c capital ottawa the northern region in more ways than one was at the top this was exemplified quite well by the map in the ottawa office of vice co ordinator hiram mackenzie in which the north pole was centered except for the enclave of europe with its scandinavian and icelandic regions all the arctic area was within the northern region roughly it could be divided into two major areas to the left on the map was all of north america above the rio grande to the right was included all of what had once been the soviet union together these areas represented the centered power of the planet in the first years of the atomic age between the two was great britain a tongue of the region licking at europe up at the top of the map distorted into odd huge shapes were australia and new zealand also member provinces of the region not all the changes of the past decades had yet altered the fact that the north was the economic ruler of the planet there was almost an ostentatious symbolism thereof in the fact that of the official regional maps byerley had seen mackenzies alone showed all the earth as though the north feared no competition and needed no favoritism to point up its pre eminence impossible said mackenzie dourly over the whiskey mr byerley you have had no training as a robot technician i believe no i have not hmp well it is in my opinion a sad thing that ching ngoma and szegeczowska havent either there is too preva lent an opinion among the peoples of earth that a co ordinator need only be a capable organizer a broad generalizer and an amiable person these days he should know his robotics as well no offense intended none taken i agree with you i take it for instance from what you have said already that you worry about the recent trifling dislocation in world economy i dont know what you suspect but it has happened in the past that people who should have known better wondered what would happen if false data were fed into the machine and what would happen mr mackenzie well the scotsman shifted his weight and sighed all collected data goes through a complicated screening system which involves both human and mechanical checking so that the problem is not likely to arise but let us ignore that humans are fallible also corruptible and ordinary mechanical devices are liable to mechanical failure the real point of the matter is that what we call a wrong datum is one which is inconsistent with all other known data it is our only criterion of right and wrong it is the machines as well order it for instance to direct agricultural activity on the basis of an average july temperature in iowa of degrees fahrenheit it wont accept that it will not give an answer not that it has any prejudice against that particular temperature or that an answer is impossible but because in the light of all the other data fed it over a period of years it knows that the probability of an average july temperature of is virtually nil it rejects that datum the only way a wrong datum can be forced on the machine is to include it as part of a self consistent whole all of which is subtly wrong in a manner either too delicate for the machine to detect or outside the machines experience the former is beyond human capacity and the latter is almost so and is becoming more nearly so as the machines experience increases by the second stephen byerley placed two fingers to the bridge of his nose then the machine cannot be tampered with and how do you account for recent errors then my dear byerley i see that you instinctively follow that great error that the machine knows all let me cite you a case from my personal experience the cotton industry engages experienced buyers who purchase cotton their procedure is to pull a tuft of cotton out of a random bale of a lot they will look at that tuft and feel it tease it out listen to the crackling perhaps as they do so touch it with their tongue and through this procedure they will determine the class of cotton the bales represent there are about a dozen such classes as a result of their decisions purchases are made at certain prices blends are made in certain proportions now these buyers cannot yet be replaced by the machine why not surely the data involved is not too complicated for it probably not but what data is this you refer to no textile chemist knows exactly what it is that the buyer tests when he feels a tuft of cotton presumably theres the average length of the threads their feel the extent and nature of their slickness the way they hang together and so on several dozen items subconsciously weighed out of years of experience but the quantitative nature of these tests is not known maybe even the very nature of some of them is not known so we have nothing to feed the machine nor can the buyers explain their own judgment they can only say well look at it cant you tell its class such and such i see there are innumerable cases like that the machine is only a tool after all which can help humanity progress faster by taking some of the burdens of calculations and interpretations off its back the task of the human brain remains what it has always been that of discovering new data to be analyzed and of devising new concepts to be tested a pity the society for humanity wont understand that they are against the machine they would be against mathematics or against the art of writing if they had lived at the appropriate time these reactionaries of the society claim the machine robs man of his soul i notice that capable men are still at a premium in our society we still need the man who is intelligent enough to think of the proper questions to ask perhaps if we could find enough of such these dislocations you worry about coordinator wouldnt occur earth including the uninhabited continent antarctica a area square miles land surface b population c capital new york the fire behind the quartz was weary now and sputtered its reluctant way to death the co ordinator was somber his mood matching the sinking flame they all minimize the state of affairs his voice was low is it not easy to imagine that they all laugh at me and yet vincent silver said the machines cannot be out of order and i must believe him hiram mackenzie says they cannot be fed false data and i must believe him but the machines are going wrong somehow and i must believe that too and so there is still an alternative left he glanced sidewise at susan calvin who with closed eyes for a moment seemed asleep what is that she asked prompt to her cue nevertheless why that correct data is indeed given and correct answers are indeed received but that they are then ignored there is no way the machine can enforce obedience to its dictates madame szegeczowska hinted as much with reference to northerners in general it seems to me so she did and what purpose is served by disobeying the machine lets consider motivations its obvious to me and should be to you it is a matter of rocking the boat deliberately there can be no serious conflicts on earth in which one group or another can seize more power than it has for what it thinks is its own good despite the harm to mankind as a whole while the machines rule if popular faith in the machines can be destroyed to the point where they are abandoned it will be the law of the jungle again and not one of the four regions can be freed of the suspicion of wanting just that the east has half of humanity within its borders and the tropics more than half of earths resources each can feel itself the natural rulers of all earth and each has a history of humiliation by the north for which it can be human enough to wish a senseless revenge europe has a tradition of greatness on the other hand it once did rule the earth and there is nothing so eternally adhesive as the memory of power yet in another way its hard to believe both the east and the tropics are in a state of enormous expansion within their own borders both are climbing incredibly they cannot have the spare energy for military adventures and europe can have nothing but its dreams it is a cipher militarily so stephen said susan you leave the north yes said byerley energetically i do the north is now the strongest and has been for nearly a century or its component parts have been but it is losing relatively now the tropic regions may take their place in the forefront of civilization for the first time since the pharaohs and there are northerners who fear that the society for humanity is a northern organization primarily you know and they make no secret of not wanting the machines susan they are few in numbers but it is an association of powerful men heads of factories directors of industries and agricultural combines who hate to be what they call the machines office boy belong to it men with ambition belong to it men who feel themselves strong enough to decide for themselves what is best for themselves and not just to be told what is best for others in short just those men who by together refusing to accept the decisions of the machine can in a short time turn the world topsy turvy just those belong to the society susan it hangs together five of the directors of world steel are members and world steel suffers from overproduction consolidated cinnabar which mined mercury at aimaden was a northern concern its books are still being investigated but one at least of the men concerned was a member francisco villafranca who singlehanded delayed the mexican canal for two months was a member we know already and so was rama vrasayana i was not at all surprised to find out susan said quietly these men i might point out have all done badly but naturally interjected byerley to disobey the machines analyses is to follow a non optimal path results are poorer than they might be its the price they pay they will have it rough now but in the confusion that will eventually follow just what do you plan doing stephen there is obviously no time to lose i am going to have the society outlawed every member removed from any responsible post and all executive and technical positions henceforward can be filled only by applicants signing a non society oath it will mean a certain surrender of basic civil liberties but i am sure the congress it wont work what why not i will make a prediction if you try any such thing you will find yourself hampered at every turn you will find it impossible to carry out you will find your every move in that direction will result in trouble byerley was taken aback why do you say that i was rather hoping for your approval in this matter you cant have it as long as your actions are based on a false premise you admit the machine cant be wrong and cant be fed wrong data i will now show you that it cannot be disobeyed either as you think is being done by the society that i dont see at all then listen every action by any executive which does not follow the exact directions of the machine he is working with becomes part of the data for the next problem the machine therefore knows that the executive has a certain tendency to disobey he can incorporate that tendency into that data even quantitatively that is judging exactly how much and in what direction disobedience would occur its next answers would be just sufficiently biased so that after the executive concerned disobeyed he would have automatically corrected those answers to optimal directions the machine knows stephen you cant be sure of all this you are guessing it is a guess based on a lifetimes experience with robots you had better rely on such a guess stephen but then what is left the machines themselves are correct and the premises they work on are correct that we have agreed upon now you say that it cannot be disobeyed then what is wrong you have answered yourself nothing is wrong think about the machines for a while stephen they are robots and they follow the first law but the machines work not for any single human being but for all humanity so that the first law becomes no machine may harm humanity or through inaction allow humanity to come to harm very well then stephen what harms humanity economic dislocations most of all from whatever cause wouldnt you say so i would and what is most likely in the future to cause economic dislocations answer that stephen i should say replied byerley unwillingly the destruction of the machines and so should i say and so should the machines say their first care therefore is to preserve themselves for us and so they are quietly taking care of the only elements left that threaten them it is not the society for humanity which is shaking the boat so that the machines may be destroyed you have been looking at the reverse of the picture say rather that the machine is shaking the boat very slightly just enough to shake loose those few which cling to the side for purposes the machines consider harmful to humanity so vrasayana loses his factory and gets another job where he can do no harm he is not badly hurt he is not rendered incapable of earning a living for the machine cannot harm a human being more than minimally and that only to save a greater number consolidated cinnabar loses control at almaden villafranca is no longer a civil engineer in charge of an important project and the directors of world steel are losing their grip on the industry or will but you dont really know all this insisted byerley distractedly how can we possibly take a chance on your being right you must do you remember the machines own statement when you presented the problem to him it was the matter admits of no explanation the machine did not say there was no explanation or that it could determine no explanation it simply was not going to admit any explanation in other words it would be harmful to humanity to have the explanation known and thats why we can only guess and keep on guessing but how can the explanation do us harm assume that you are right susan why stephen if i am right it means that the machine is conducting our future for us not only simply in direct answer to our direct questions but in general answer to the world situation and to human psychology as a whole and to know that may make us unhappy and may hurt our pride the machine cannot must not make us unhappy stephen how do we know what the ultimate good of humanity will entail we havent at our disposal the infinite factors that the machine has at its perhaps to give you a not unfamiliar example our entire technical civilization has created more unhappiness and misery than it has removed perhaps an agrarian or pastoral civilization with less culture and less people would be better if so the machines must move in that direction preferably without telling us since in our ignorant prejudices we only know that what we are used to is good and we would then fight change or perhaps a complete urbanization or a completely caste ridden society or complete anarchy is the answer we dont know only the machines know and they are going there and taking us with them but you are telling me susan that the society for humanity is right and that mankind has lost its own say in its future it never had any really it was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand at the whims of climate and the fortunes of war now the machines understand them and no one can stop them since the machines will deal with them as they are dealing with the society having as they do the greatest of weapons at their disposal the absolute control of our economy how horrible perhaps how wonderful think that for all time all conflicts are finally evitable only the machines from now on are inevitable and the fire behind the quartz went out and only a curl of smoke was left to indicate its place and that is all said dr calvin rising i saw it from the beginning when the poor robots couldnt speak to the end when they stand between mankind and destruction i will see no more my life is over you will see what comes next i never saw susan calvin again she died last month at the age of eighty two goldshire build in valheim tried to capture as much detail as i could the path leads all the way back to stormwind and i will be detailing the forest with the graveyards etc next stop lakeshire hope you like it well looks like im re rolling a human warrior for the hundredth time god damn starting zone music this is scarily accurate awesome job how long did it take you thanks ive been on and off for almost a week so probably about full days having done some base building in vallheim myself i totally recognize the effort that went into this looks amazing man i am catching the feeling of the zone in it great details in the inn aswell having hours of pure building time on valheim this build makes me want to sink another in seriously well done op this is incredibly cool this is beautiful and why does that music always hit me in the heart walking through goldshire right now even the trees are placed properly and with the same relative width and tree type are you okay this is amazing to the point of concern is that with the games normal weight physics turned off i remember those were brutal lol i would assume its done in creative mode would be hard to get the dvergr there without spawning them also i think the only way to get the barrels there would be spawning them in too still takes a lot of time effort and thought to do a build like this though when i see the title i was scared that it would required a nsfw tag lol its safe to assume thats why we didnt get to see the basement of the inn seeing all those rabbits tells me this is moon guard wow its amaziingg i cant wait to see your next post this is gorgeous almost seems like noblegarden time with all the bunnies too incredible man would love to see updated graphics for a wow or something using unreal engine now tame a star boar and name it princess have you uploaded that to youtube as well the reddit player is painfully bad and id like to see this in high quality looks like youve done an awesome job awesome dude this is insane i love it next up full stormwind build started on it almost a year ago but it was so much work it always makes me happy when i see posts like this instead of games sucks now cause x this looks great this is one of my favorite zones in the game can you imagine the headless horseman attacking this village wild amazing now you just need to add all the people dueling in front of the inn there was just something about the music in vanilla that was so pure every time i hear it it takes me back to when i was leveling my very first character no other expansion has had music that memorable its the essence of nostalgia for me with wow this is what hit me too massive nostalgia wave tirisfal goldshire and eversong are my favourites well done dude this is beautifully done now build a moonguard goldshire and go inside the inn the music does so much of wow if only newer wow had this good music wow this is amazing my dude only missing the moonguard touch to give it that wholesome rp look p thats amazing nicely done yo i absolutely adore this places from world of warcraft recreated in other games has got to be my favorite kind of post here its always such a treat seeing how lovingly theyve been recreated and how our favorite places look in other game engines this was a joy to watch you did a great job where the night elf bitches at utterly fantastic job well done love it wtf this is so damn impressive omg ily this was a bucket list thing for me to do thats awesome only needs some female night elves dancing on the tables for this to be on point as soon as you went into the inn i almost lost it i had such a big smile on my face the whole time watching this i now want to play a wowheim crossover whoa incredible details so when will you program yrel in the basement modlist i recognize some of those build pieces from odin mods thats awesome do you have a post about stormwind as well or is it a wip thanks yeah i started stormwind a while back but stopped as i burnt myself out a bit heres the link for that video badass bravo i havent played for a long time but looks like theres been some updates to make this all possible looks great awesome mate everyone should give valheim a try bring friends and dont try to look up how to play just figure it out and have an adventure gorgeous recreation of it almost makes me want to re sub for a bit of nostalgia as someone who cant play wow anymore thanks to long term medical side effects seeing goldshire reproduced in a game thats become near and dear to my heart is beyond amazing thank you for this having built stuff in valheim i cant even begin to imagine what a pain in the ass this was this is amazing to me valheim has always reminded me a bit of wow for some reason this is the coolest build ive seen you are amazing i mean yeah this is valheim but its modded to the extent where i dont even recognize the game absolutely stunning opening part with all the rabbits hopping around made me think of the noble garden event currently happening in goldshire holy shit this looks like it took forever very well done this is looney toons this is really awesome well done i leave wow when life gets too busy and resub back when a new expansion hits hoping it would bring with it some of the feeling i still get whenever i portal to stormwind and know those pesky bandits are right outside the gates theres simply nothing that can erase that first toon memories of hoofing it to westfall with a boring ass horse to go do deadmines with that first green drop lakeshire is one of my favourite villages in a game its neck and neck with kakariko village from ocarina of time on the n for me love both equally and couldnt pick and outright favourite looking forward to your lakeshire creation not moonguard for sure meanwhile people from the moon guard server be looking at the inside of the inn and be like its missing something gotta knock points off because i dont see any naked draenei dancing on the tables good work though amazing do stormwind next makes me wonder what pc you got for it to run that smoothly with all the stuff going on anyway this looks crazy good well done mate this is awesome is this unmodded version of valheim or is it imported assets impressive buddy awesome stuff holy shit wow well done how long did this take you have an award wheres the demon children was so confused if vanilla but no way still incredibly awesome and pretty accurate imo love love love this reminds me of the graphics from that south park episode amazing you are going to give me your world file totally amazing could you imagine if the whole game looked like this i just want to give you props dude i tried playing valheim and really wanted to enjoy it because it seemed like my cup of tea but i found the building system to be so janky this is impressive the building system is the best part of the game and has very little jank compared to any building game except probably minecraft what exactly was the issues you were having as choppy as vanilla thats attention to detail wow great work beautiful never played valheim but i can appreciate the effort this took for sure does this use mods to achieve this look and stuff well done op this is basass dude makes me yearn for a wow this is so so good great work i would re sub if all of wow looks like this didnt recognise it without all the pvp flags and spectators on mounts incredible now add some futa draenei ugh i need an azeroth in valheim sick build a whole wow looking like that might be hella fun to play and enjoy just seeing him run around with the music makes me wonder what the classes would feel like but honestly sure looks fun next do durotar itll still just be brown mud d this is amazing meanwhile westfall is quite truly on fire great work missing the rp and the mailbox with someone dancing for money epic this is so fucking cool i dont even know where to begin awesome awesome job cant wait to see redridge itll be in the plains i presume this is clearly a labour of love and gives me alliance feels back to the login screen i go this is amazing great work im interested how did you find such a flat terrain seed or was it all manually flattened that was amazing this is amazing this is awesome kings honor friend do razor hill next need someone to start working on brill china needs to establish wage and price controls china near shanghai im genuinely confused as to why the nytimes reports so much on china i mean for me a person living in china its helpful to read some of these largely negative perspectives that are typically devoid of any rationale as to why the chinese government does what it does beyond the assertion that china is a brutal and duplicitous authoritarian state but why do folks in the states care what china is up to massive trade partner large economy and has a different global approach than the us i am focusing on as neutral as possible terms by the by hence it is news by the nature of its existence maybe we have investments because its the second largest economy in the world the same statement is true for the us bidens economic narrative looks different inflated so to speak from what is happening on main street things in the us are looking pretty good for many on main st with very low unemployment and wages rising what do you expect china has simply degenerated into another failing corrupt conservative society tearing the world economy apart its fun seeing all the totally organic commentary from people who are trying to make this story about america and the us economy yes guys what about america a classic diversionary tactic its worst economic slowdown of last year was growth and that in the jaws of yo yo ing between excessive lockdowns and a huge first national covid wave and that nominal gdp growth must naturally flatten as its population peaks no mature economy can or should sustain growth of pa chinas problems are structural imbalances of the kind that have been features of capitalism high youth unemployment not unlike europe in the face of not just mechanisation but urbanisation undue investment in real estate familiar to the us australia ireland etc etc the bbc reports home ownership of nearly so theres limited renting and up to of owners have a second apartment even discounting the numbers of parents owning a second apartment to help children thats a huge potential bubble given not many second apartments are lifestyle getaways how is that different from here the biden administration keeps touring its economic achievements but the average american feels angst over inflation ravaging their purchasing power unaffordable houses rents and continued warnings from professional economics that the u s may be heading into a recession deep thinker tbf us employment is strong chinas youth unemployment rate is very serious i forgot to mention americans are also worried because their credit card debt is now at record highs denying reality and democracy for a living while projecting blame for their own corruption and incompetence on imaginary and foreign scapegoats the breakfast of dictators despots and authoritarians worldwide see china russia and republistan for reference hmmmmm why does that sounds eerily similar to how americans feel it is absolutely past time for the us to decouple from china end all missions exchanges student visas and immigration just end it the nixon experiment failed big time the great know it all xi will inevitably make a decree that the economy should be good and it will be good and you better agree or else a fertility rate of replacement would be that is the key statistic to measure what young chinese think about their prospects they have lost confidence in the leadership and that means transitioning to a consumer based economy is almost impossible a closed information apparatus will always have credibility problems distrust is inevitable when a country is treated like a potemkin village some of this is a different way of thinking or quite different housing for instance is doing very good its supposed to be down given the chinese governments history of punishing people who speak out why would all these people openly complain i still think what were seeing is more about china trying to convince the world they are no threat than a true crisis it is a shame that only in china does the media distribute what those on decision making positions want to hear which excludes criticism of media itself how difficult it is to have a functioning economy when the emperor can suddenly shut it down on a whim maybe they will learn one day that change must be aimed at the top in order to solve this the chinese government has stolen the hope of its people welcome to the pains and gains of capitalism as dr m l king said capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources with this system a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level thats the way the system works capitalism in china should not be viewed only as progress in production but also in knowledge for many years the fidel castro regime in cuba criticized capitalism for not being able to eliminate poverty and he was correct while capitalism can mitigate poverty through social transfers it is nearly impossible to eradicate the processes that create poverty under capitalism in summary it seems that poverty is inherent to capitalism and that a lower standard of living and lower wages are needed in capitalism for its perpetuation why should it be different in china china is communist though most decisions are made centrally by a politburo three years of rigid covid policy coupled with a real estate boom spurred on by central planning creating entirely empty cities is hardly capitalism cloves agree i think what you are saying is absolutely inevitable for a developing consumer economy like china these are the growing pains if you will cloves capitalism is what allowed china to lift m people from poverty since the late s they are highs and lows but china is vastly richer now china is afraid of its people they tightly regulate what can be said and insist on happy talk in the meantime they have a huge problem with unemployed youth which they wont talk about having millions of unemployed young people with access to the internet is a recipe for major problems the other issue is that since no one is allowed to talk about problems they are ignored and continue to grow until the situations blows up in a catastrophe it would be far better to admit there is a problem and work on it while it is small and can be fixed but that is not how the chinese system works bruce if thats true why are all these people speaking to western media all the problems confronting china will soon be ours too but because of its rapid trajectory its a bellwether going through all the stages of a sick economy in quick succession and you can rest assured our politicians will be just as unimaginative craven and deliberately obtuse as their ccp counterparts to address matters before they get ugly weve temporarily solved our problem through record credit card debt as people struggle to maintain their rapidly dwindling standard of living youll never hear this statistic mentioned when we hear about the miracle of bidenomics where our economy is literally a house of cards diminished employment prospects among the young and educated and unaffordable housing its hard to tell which country im referring to who pray tell is supposed to buy all those evs rolling out of the factories when their credit line is zero yes what about whataboutism i visited china in july my observation there is more consistent with chinese media than what nyt reports chinas big problem is the real estate market it makes everyone hesitate to spend but otherwise consumer spending car sale and tourism expenditure are going up this year apple and tesla sales are very strong in china which is also an indication china has undergone the largest rural to urban migration in all of recorded history in the past years it should come as no surprise to anyone that a mass movement of this scale should be accompanied by unrest inequality and fading prospects the chinese government clams up in times of turmoil which is why well never know the true extent of these economic issues rising literacy and gdp per capita means you dont want to work in service rather than production its physically easier more lucrative and offers the highest ceiling for the first countries to make this shift thats fine the rest of the world continued to make the products these increasingly rich countries could afford to buy in larger quantities the problem is that this process makes producing countries more wealthy and while the so called communist government of china was able to suppress that wealth getting to most of the workforce for decades that could never be sustained service industry jobs are lucrative because they act as force multipliers for productive industries therefore they are very efficient value producers hence why they are paid more but only if productive industries are present however while all this is happening technological development makes productive industries more efficient as well lowering the need for workers in those sectors in effect theres nowhere to fall back to for those transitioning from production to service so you have a workforce that demands service industry jobs a service industry that has increasingly fewer productive industries to service and productive industries that need less people to function this leads to lower demand for everything products and services as economies deflate like air leaving a punctured tire this is the natural progression of capitalism and is unavoidable under this system we will be on the same track soon economy is slowing and the feds want it that way to cool inflation therell be a couple of years of slowdown ahead then the feds will start printing money again almost like in the us where we constantly get headlines like bidens economy is great why arent voters giving him credit despite the income to home price ratio growing at record high rates and peoples average standard of living getting worse at roughly the same rate it has for decades these are interesting stories about a few individuals and i understand that creating a narrative this way is the core nyt style but are there any data polls that say how people feel about the economy about the direction of their country about their political leaders polls that segment the population in to rich poor urban rural educated uneducated how about just data like homelessness today versus years ago changes in the of the population unemployed as a reader i am never convinced by anecdotal story telling john agree in the data need but it is also the point of the piece china government figures are not reliable if you do business with china you will hear enough stories to form a reliable view that companies are in travel in my business which covers multiple sectors you hear of average order size down volumes down there is a definite problem going into q and the real economy of smes is slowing significantly add to that the indisputable data available on real estate debt defaults and the fact this was central to prior years growth are wealthy chinese insulated from the economic woes if that were true theyd return to touring europe in huge numbers and that hasnt happened there have been very few chinese tourists in europe this year compared to pre pandemic years the problem is worse than that china is in debt bomb economic crash and demographic crash there is no possible recovery only social economic and governmental crash a war with taiwan would make worse because to would also kill imports and cause a famine that would kill half chinese population from your fingertips to gods eyeballs id rather lose half a billion chinese to famine than half a billion americans europeans and others plus half a billion chinese to the war that theyre planning xi might be a terrible leader but the chinese economy is not doomed just as biden and democratic party led economy are not doomed for failure frideswide not doomed but when has an economic bubble not burst no economy is necessarily doomed but all economies wax wane it seems animal spirits are as much a part of the chinese hybrid command control economy as any other unsurprisingly the us economy again is defying negative expectations i believe we can thank bidens steady leadership on the other hand britain appears to be rising up to its pundits negative expectations sean t except here you can see new car sales are strong and prices are high new home sales are strong and prices are high airline fares are high due to strong demand and unemployment claims remain low maybe your retail business is just in the wrong trend there are signs of weakness in the us economy but also incredible signs of strength patrick i said retail but i meant restaurant which is a mainstream business i think i own an apartment in manhattan and the price on that is also down significantly based on building unit sales compared to who knows maybe its just manhattan that is suffering and the rest of the country is doing great poll numbers dont seem to suggest that is the reality though i wonder if the difficulties you are having are still connected to so many commuters not commuting into nyc for work discouraging people to think for themselves inevitably results in less innovation chinas economy will suffer and indeed already is the companies of the future will not originate in the country if its government continues to stifle free enterprise just another example how actions have consequences china threatens taiwan india vietnam the philippines the united states and indirectly europe and they expected business to continue as usual scott covid started in wuhan in the fall of and china did not warn the world sorry didnt read the entire article let me guess republicans oppose this there is no reason that an agency that pays for billions on these drugs should not use that to leverage better pricing its the central pillar of how walmart runs tell the republicans its just business it is absurd that medicare has ever been required to pay whatever the monopolistic pharmaceutical companies dictate especially since they seem to have no objection to negotiating with private health insurance companies and foreign socialized and singlepayer medical care systems this is a long overdue reform and i personally am quite pleased by it because the two most expensive medications i take both ridiculously expensive are on the list the cost for xarelto was for a thirty day supply with the use of insurance if you were able to get from a canadian pharmacy it was for a thirty day supply negotiation what a swat team with heavy weapons conducts with a criminal negotiation what the government does with drug companies if a manufacturer refuses to negotiate or wont agree to what federal rules call a maximum fair price the company will face a substantial tax or must withdraw from medicare and medicaid at least call them by some more accurate term big pharma says that negotiations are a threat to innovation the only threat is to their profits what about the research they receive at a reduced cost or free from government nih shouldnt they pay fair market value i know of a drug that has a copay of for a month supply the pharmacy says it saves money to get the month supply its hilariously unfunny that there is a different side of this debate republicans are absolutely corrupt and shameless when did you first notice this interesting fact its a start more than any other pres has done for us keep it going pres biden consumers will not see benefits swiftly with the lower negotiated prices due to become available in early alas more trickle down eventual benefits if the patients live long enough to actually experience them this mornings early jump upward in the stock prices of major pharmaceutical companies bears this out gotta love johnson johnson in their court filings they claim that they have a constitutional right to your tax money god bless them way to go joe im no shill for big pharma but the industry is hardly the boogeyman in americas dismal industrial healthcare landscape few of us would enjoy the lives we lead today absent the miraculous drugs and biologics the industry has been delivering for decades while generating life saving life altering and life enhancing products that dwarf the outputs of virtually every other science and technology based industries that are heralded for their products what americans pay out of pocket for medicines is solely attributable to the failure of the american political system to provide american citizens and residents with cradle to grave health insurance which is the birthright of hundreds of millions of citizens and residents living in other advanced industrial states lower medicare drug costs means lower taxes will the gqp buy in thank you president biden who understands his mission to serve the public as best as he can to win republican support that statute included language that prohibited any role for the government to negotiate medication prices the inflation reduction act known as ira rescinded the prohibition and this is why one has to wonder why any person in their right mind would ever vote for a republican especially if they are not wealthy democrats work for the common good and the working class republicans worship at the altar of greed and corporate money i take eliquis mgs twice daily and pay for three months because i am blessed to have great medical and prescription insurance from my retirement plan if i had to pay the retail price it would be plus for the same amount it seems my prescription plan negotiated a better price so should medicare be denied the same price i am on medicare im not sure why eliquis is on that list go to their website and sign up for discounts i pay a month now are you on medicare and does it apply if you are the only reason you get a discount is because someone else is paying full price read the fine print bottom line a political trick designed to mislead as the article notes these drugs will be available as low cost generics very soon ergo its all being done with big pharmas interests in mind lol the joke is on you owl big pharma often makes minor tweaks to the formulations of proprietary drugs just before they are due to go generic and thereby extending the period they can charge full price for it they have many ways to manipulate our laws to insure they remain among the most profitable industries not just in the us but in the entire world republicans have been fighting this for decades this is one of the bigger wins for biden and we owe him and his team and the dems who supported this in congress a vote of thanks it is long past due will be fun to watch republicans arguing that its outrageous that the federal government is using its massive purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices for the benefit of all americans maybe just maybe it will begin to dawn on lunch pail americans that republicans dont really have their best interests at heart for what its worth with life essential pharmaceutics thats quite a lot imbruvica already has at least two descendent drugs that cost knee buckling amounts of money literally unaffordable for anyone who is not a multi millionaire or wealthier who does not have robust health insurance coverage a long running issue we know about is drugs with clinically minimal modifications being developed that satisfy statutory criteria for qualifying as a new drug but clinically are for all intents and purposes cosmetic and do not justify the exorbitant prices of those drugs this phenomenon has been true of drugs to treat diabetes hypertension and other chronic health problems when dealing with life threatening life shortening health problems leaving solutions up to raw capitalism essentially creates a system of extortion of holding our lives hostage for profits those developing life saving life essential drugs deserve fair compensation but not what the market will bear when the market is people dying that is a big part of why human societies developed governments in the first place from tribal councils to member parliaments either we have equal rights as defined by equal access to life saving life essential medications or we dont so i ask although it seems insane are the nations seniors currently paying more for drugs than they are for food sure looks that way from what i read here health insurance in the us costs they typical family about that does not include out of pocket expenses big pharma is going to hate this expect lots of political adds paid for by big pharma telling us all that grandma is going to die if we cut their profits this is good example of what biden is doing to hurt the economy having medicare negotiate with drug companies to reduce prices on popular prescription drugs this is obviously big government over reach into how the private sector operates in the economy just because people are dying because they cant afford necessary drugs is no excuse for socialism did you get that from fox news i think its sarcasm it wont be when fox says it i can buy these drugs in other countries for a fraction of what they charge here and we the taxpayer often subsidize the research and clinical trials for these pharma companies yet we bear the burden of outrageous profits to shareholders and execs this is a prime example of quality leadership for which it would seem you are unfamiliar or you forgot s at the end of your joke its about time this is great news unfortunately like everything else in this country when a president wants to affect real change for its citizens your gonna see big pharma ramping up their lobbying probably lawsuits but its us taxpayers that pay for the research on drugs big pharma just reaps the profits at the end of the day this system has to change all other industrialized countries can negotiate drug prices except the u s richest country in the world but a third world country when it comes to our health care system and its drug pricing we should also prohibit advertising of prescription drugs the washington lobbyists just love this big pharma will be wheel barrowing in money to them after all ceos and bod cant survive on only a markup finally the george w bush administration expanded medicare drug coverage to not include price negotiation because they knew the incoming obama administration would include it seniors like me have doctors who prescribe drugs which may not be the best but what we can afford i thought is was because bid pharma financed w this is why i love joe biden for president can anyone imagine a trump or desantis even countenancing doing something for ordinary people like this they are more like one of the early scenes in the handmaids tale where after rounding up a group of women they start taking the walkers away from disabled and pushing girls with downs syndrome into their own line bad news for martin shkreli and his ilk finally it took three years ive been waiting for this for quite a while and why must it be limited to ten with all the data and information we have available this looks like a task that should take three months not three years glad to see this story got moved to the top of the front page where it belongs it is vastly more important than mark meadows a good start biden administration now we wait for the outlandish cries of socialism from the lying right queue the gloom and doom from big pharma that this will take away our medicines that ignores the fact that britain france germany and switzerland all have major pharmaceutical companies and all regulate the price of drugs while the press chases negative narratives and rs try and distract with cultural boogeymen president biden keeps working hard for all americans joe biden has a special interest group the good news is that it is us loving this comment gandalf about time how many people have died becuase of the high cost of health in this country big pharma has no concerns about the unmet health needs of patients only their profits not being able to negotiate prices was done by george w s administration specifically dick i have not heart cheny this is another reason to vote blue republicans only care about their donors money there are many drugs used to treat immune disorders i have been on biologics for over twenty years and they have helped me immensely but at huge cost have always had good insurance but that is another matter as my rheumatologist pointed out to me when the monthly cost of treatment is essentially the same regardless of the medication it can only be price fixing its blatantly obvious i worked in molecular genetics and biology research over thirty years the pharmaceutical industry knows how to make monoclonals at very large scale they are profiteering at obscene levels has anyone ever seen a forensic audit of the true costs of these biologics welcome to capitalism almost all of these drugs are recognizable from advertisements on tv and in publications do the drug companies pass on the cost of mass advertising to he consumer i for one am sick of seeing these drug ads they infer that people can tell their doctor what drug to treat them with does anyone read the side effects at the end of the ads i didnt think so that is the reason that drugs companies advertise doctors have a difficult time convincing patients they dont need an advertised drug without advertising how would we know we have rls restless leg syndrome thankfully in ireland you dont see ads for drugs ever not allowed then ireland would make a good control group to better understand the impact of pharmaceutical advertising on sales and medical outcomes commercials for drugs should be forbidden like commericals for tobacco these are not consumer products since consumers cannot even buy them without a prescription all this leads to is know nothing patients badgering their doctors the push for price negotiation faced intense opposition from pharmaceutical companies which contend that capping potential earning erodes their ability to invest in further research and development no it will not affect future research it will just hit the already bloated and obscene bottom line of the drug companies and their investors bingo still seething the makers of eliquis successfully sued to keep their patent until when the fda had at least one generic approved for use greed pure greed indeed a family member pays for a months supply insurance wont cover it for some mysterious reason through my plan just found out the manufacturer does have a co pay card you can sign up for havent tried to use it yet but the neighbor who told me about it says it has saved her a ton but not insulin insulin was already price capped as part of the ira insulin is already capped novolog is insulin it is on the list im glad biden is doing this only thing trump ever did was give tax breaks to the billionaires who own the drug companies another thing republicans will look to kill if theyre in power why benefit patients when there are insurance executive pockets to line which turn into campaign contributions i know people on some of these drugs they are prohibitively expensive and i can see why some people go bankrupt or maybe even just prefer to die that is the outcome heartless republicans want it doesnt happen to them because congress has cadillac health insurance i would say that i hope it happens to someone they love except that they dont know how to love so it wouldnt change a thing thank you president biden and all the democrats who made this historic bill possible my wife was prescribed an inhaler here in the us per month in her native australia six dollars my sister got her inhaler from canada with her doctors blessing it was so expensive in the usa much cheaper there when biden announced the price cap on insulin i checked the average median i cant remember price of all insulin delivery methods in oecd countries and it was us of course this doesnt mean biden didnt make a reasonable effort but it demonstrates how terrible our healthcare insurance system is and how americans are played for suckers yet we have a party the gqp that completely opposed bidens actions and of the population that agrees with the gqp and is willing to get screwed though of them need the discount are inhalers even on the list joe and the democrats continue to govern to help people while the gqp prop up their cult leader investigates hunter and may impeach joe vote blue thank you president biden for this long overdue common sense legislation and republicans continue to work and vote against their constituents best interests and those who vote for them do so not realizing how muuch they are hurting themselves j j says its worried about how this will affect their ability to address patients unmet medical needs without a hint that they realize the irony of patients currently being priced out of addressing their medical needs theyre not alone in not getting it theyre just the only ones who said it out loud the cost for eliquis or entresto for a medicare part d participant is over per initial day supply most doctors do not realize the cost not many people can afford that so whats the alternative a less efficient drug or no treatment coumadin is dirt cheap but requires monitoring it was the standard before drugs like eliquis were developed yes but it requires monitoring and has many more side effects my mother who had had two heart valve replacements was on coumadin she couldnt take eliquis the stuff eventually went toxic on her and she died oooo i got this family member has been on coumadin warfarin for years it requires frequent monitoring dietary changes are recommended and side effects said family member can tell when the levels are off because of the pain and cramping another family member was recently put on eliquis no side effects of note no monitoring but a whopping co pay with bluecross blueshield insurance damned if you do and damned if you dont thats what it feels like the cost of drugs in u s is a national disgrace vote blue when i tell my friends in the uk and europe what we pay for prescriptions they are utterly gobsmacked yup its a start long over due now lets hope the republiclowns dont undermine it somehow dont vote for repulicans any of them something is better than nothing however there are well over prescription drugs on the u s market so of them is of the prescription drugs sold wow and the reason we had a list of thousands and but the big pharma lobby forced the hand of congress with kickbacks to their campaigns and the kept whittling down the list until we to wound up with just can we please shut down k street and our insidious system of crony capitalism they have created and take our country back from these nearly invisible corporate oligarchs that are destroying our republic start by voting a straight blue ticket and then put pressure on those elected while there may be drugs sold the vast majority of prescriptions for about of them some of them already have generic versions so this is a significant improvement of course more must be done repubs will say this will stop innovation when in fact they wrote into law that medicare was prevented from negotiating with drug companies how many other things does the government buy where price negotiation is forbidden by law reuters link below lists the drugs no mention of this anywhere on fox propagandas website their followers have no idea this is happening trump is in trouble with his court cases so fox is too busy talking about hunter and wokeism in order to distract their viewers they are busy telling people how woke dems are paying children to change their sex if anyone credible adding to the list is reading this consider adding xtandi and xgeva both are cancer treatment drugs xtandi was approved in and has no generic cost k month xgeva was approved in and has no generic cost k months without my insurance i am not sure what i would do to pay for these treatments are we supposed to die if we dont have the money or insurance the republican way to reduce both social security and medicare have people die as soon as possible i suspect your insurance companys negotiated rate is only fraction of that price the same as they do for hospital bills in i had a brain tumor removed and spent a week in the icu the hospital bill was over thankfully i had very good insurance and paid less than my insurance company paid their negotiated rate of if i didnt have insurance i wouldve gone bankrupt and lost my house this is why the u s needs a single payer system the bigger the group the more bargaining power it has as long as there is profit in healthcare your health is irrelevant america is broken but nothing in america is as broken as healthcare blame the government blame insurance companies blame the healthcare industry what you pay for healthcare services or pharmaceuticals truly makes no sense and does not seem to follow basic supply and demand pricing its something else and im sure its about big money blame greed supply and demand only works when the demanding person has a choice three month supply of eliquis us canada same product same drug company no other first world country allows its citizenry to be ripped off in the same predatory way that the republicans make sure that the u s citizenry is ripped off reminder if you are not old enough for medicare youll still be paying the price that no other country will allow this is absolutely true it seems to me the u s effectively subsidizes pharma costs for the rest of the world pharma companies have to make a profit they dont exist for sheer altruism if they didnt make a profit investors would go elsewhere and if theyre not making money on eliquis in canada they need to make it somewhere else maybe im wrong of course but it sure looks that way from where im sitting the current cost in england is pre prescription item though you may be eligible for free prescriptions depending on your age or circumstances if you live in scotland wales or northern ireland you do not have to pay for your prescriptions we look on aghast at the system as it stands in america you can get free nhs prescriptions in england if at the time the prescription is dispensed you are or over are under are to and in full time education are pregnant or have had a baby in the previous months and have a valid maternity exemption certificate matex have a specified medical condition and have a valid medical exemption certificate medex have a continuing physical disability that prevents you going out without help from another person and have a valid medical exemption certificate medex hold a valid war pension exemption certificate and the prescription is for your accepted disability are an nhs inpatient ramaswamy said that climate change is a hoax and that he wants to give a hire of ukraine to putin he will never be president haley is intelligent and also a woman when it comes to republican politics she hasnt a snowballs chance she may get the middle ground gop vote but none from the qanon majority other than trump desantis is the only candidate who can actually run on his record and that includes joe yawn the republican plank vote for trump climate change is a hoax the federal government is weaponized against republicans dont talk about abortion because it is unpopular to do so haley is capable of being slimy as much as the others all non starters they should just rebrand and call themselves fascists all hat no cattle theyre all losers the entire spectacle was a waste of air time its pretty bad when nikki haley is the most reasonable person in the room chris christie isnt doing himself any favors hes certainly not wrong about trump but he will never get through to the cultists since this has become nothing but performative art can the next debate feature swim suit competition i dont know whos poll numbers those are but theres no way that desantis won that debate and swammy was obnoxious while nicki haley came across as a reasonable person nobody came across as presidential if any of these freaks make it to the general election they will lose ive never seen another group so off kilter from either a political perspective in their lack of moral character or from the outrageous garbage that they take as political gospel this is absolutely pointless i hope nikki gets out of this travesty she now knows she can develop mass appeal and is simply better than the others maybe the country will survive trump and she can take a shot in but raising her hand was a profound moral effor even christie raised his hand pathetic raising her hand was nothing short of a disqualification for her to be president nimrata is always calculating her odds and goes whichever way the wind blows his name pretty much says it all ramaswarmy ramasmarmy pretty much every republican has made it clear that they intend to abolish womens private choices about reproduction i dont have a reason to support any of them a perceptive and well written analysis thanks the only winner in that debate was donald trump the only thing the of them did was to prove themselves equally unworthy to lead this country true and yet trump is still a loser the biggest loser well then i look forward to seeing joe try to debate him i would certainly love to watch joe biden mop the floor with donald trump once again but since donald trump didnt feel it was worthy to show up and debate joe biden should do the same drama slimy is so intellectually stunted high school hes proof that an ivy league credential compliments of affirmative action and funding from a george soros fellowship is not a guarantee of a good education at the very least hes an educated derelict and an anti intellectual scam typical of a maga circular grift his entrepreneurial accomplishments or a con plishments were all made by cheating and manipulation hes iterating this juvenile malfeasance on the national level touch the problem that haley has is that as she sells herself to the trump faction of the republican party she will tick off the rest of america especially women who may have considered supporting her on the other hand she doesnt sell herself to the yrumpers she will not win the nomination assuming that trump self implodes before the convention ramaswamy says he wants elon musk as an advisor should he become president saying he laid off of the employees at twitter and then the effectiveness actually went up what an idiot he is the next trump the next loser yeah and he vivek is not wrong twitteris so bad off theyve already put an x on their own tombstone haley would be a formidable opponent to biden in a general election but she wont win the nomination this time however i worry about haley and cheney in if trump takes there is no i do think biden harris wins despite real concerns the country will prevail but perhaps only by a thin margin then we have to survive until to see what happens if the trumpers want to have fighting in the streets then the fed will have no choice but to give it to them well see it will be interesting to see what happens to the republicans once trump shuffles off this mortal coil do his voters vote for anybody else and will they move en masse as for democrats plenty waiting in the wings if they want to toss their hat in the ring in granholm klobuchar katie porter mayor pete hakim jeffries just to name a few cheney is a dreadfully awful candidate shell never be on a republican ticket face it this was a clown show where each clown had a slightly different agenda scott vr are running for vp haley is positioning herself for hutchinson and burgum are trying to appeal to a gop that died in pence is clueless neither the pro trump nor anti trump wings of the party want an obsequious toady who thought for himself exactly once in years desantis made the mistake of running to the right of trump mistaking the trump worship for actual hard conservative outlook christie wants another shot at trump and may also surmise that a major republican defeat in might open a few doors for him only desantis and pence are foolish enough to expect to prevail over the whining orange dotard of the collected also rans only haley looks like shell have any political life in thanks seriously for breaking it down for we readers whom wouldnt dare watch it thank you i lasted only min but in that short time i agree with everything you say looking ahead to haley in wonder who the dems will put forward dont think itll be harris i dont get to vote in the closed republican primary left it long ago now but can vote in democratic primary wouldnt be surprised if orange man were convicted he would be taken off the california ballot pence actually is a hologram interesting that republican voters prefer the most despicable candidates by far trump desantis and ramaswamy for those of us that were lifelong republicans please just start referring to donalds cult as the maga party till the old john mccain party starts speaking out before its to late in the meantime ill just keep voting democratic as i have since i gave barack obama my vote from my perspective this was not a well conducted discourse or a debate but a randomly choreographed farce by the moderators who were ignored by the participants no cohesive discussion of policies emerged for magats in the audience to follow through no one won which implies that the alleged criminal indicted for felonies in numerous courts and who was not present at the scene did not lose any ground this event was a favor to biden who needs it to win in the chief magat would be the weakest opponent for him in weakened further by his legal troubles vote blue desantis emerges as the front runner clinging to a week abortion ban regardless of womens and doctor proof it is killing women he takes credit for refusing to allow ap tests which forces students to seek colleges else where as he proclaims the answer ot the s border is to shoot and kill does he think he can win no votes from blue states he wont make it to nh hes spending huge amounts too early and getting the same kind of return on the investment that jeb bush did no but as a floridian ive watched how he gerrymandered our map to go his way ugly little troll by not knowing that the fed not the potus sets interest rates we have one of the worlds lowest inflation rates and its on the decline we are an energy exporter not an energy importer oil prices are a global not domestic phenomenon illegal border crossings are in decline of americans are not in favor of strict abortion bans rather than the opposite as stated by pence unemployment is near record lows and there are over million job openings bullets are the biggest cause of childhood deaths they all disqualified themselves excellent list pence is a posturing pious fool boblesch please run for public office a good list but the average americans only see high interests rates high food prices and gas prices that go up more than down this is what the average voters remember this race will be won on scare tactic campaign advertising may the best ad man or woman win abortion on one side the other side is just all about one thing trump i would have ranked haley pence christie thats because youre looking at from the view of a sane person and not a likely gop primary voter desantis is stripped of any personality since being governor hes done his best to grab headlines for limiting voting rights gutting libraries and narrowing school curriculum what a pathetic human being you lost me with the term human but pathetic certainly works and yet the people ive spoken with thought haley was the clear winner while desantis and ramaswamy came across as both egotistical and unknowledgeable on both domestic and global issues remember what the italians did to benito dont give me nor the american populace any uh ideas hear that conny great article ramaswamy aggressively went after mike pence i believe this was a good tactic by him and his campaign as a result his pro trumpian lean could not have been better shown going after the prior vp and contrasting your views directly with him basically demonstrated that ramaswamy is in pursuit of that position on the republican ticket if his goal was to impress an audience of one which i believe it was he completely succeeded and as a result won the debate hes so plainly running for vp that it should be embarrassing i wish he would just run for a train out of this country for good to call him obnoxious is a gross understatement i dont know who won but i know the six who lost at least in my mind the six raising their hands saying they would support trump if nominated even if he were convicted by a jury they are clearly not eligible for the job themselves or they dont expect to win the nomination in some are using this race as practice for next time the republican party has a history of not nominating women or people of color ask ted cruz about how the republicans had mark halporin ask their half cuban republican front runner in about what cuban food and cuban music he liked the rather heavy handed smack down of the non white guy who was a harvard law school graduate former texas ag u s senator but he wasnt white thank goodness one could only imagine what a smart person could have done in trumps place trump was only good at criminal activity so vivek nikki and tim yall might hang in there but you are going nowhere desantis is the epitome of a dumb politician so christie pence or that guy on the end mark twain easier to fool people than to convince them that they were fooled the media wants a horse race these candidates are the south end of that north bound horse truth president joe biden won the gqp debate but haley raised her hand supporting an if convicted candidate the of republican primary voters too gullible to vote likely under estimated the show was broadcast on a cable tv station of fox so it wasnt accessible to the large national population of cord cutters the rumbletv co broadcast of the show ostensibly intended to allow access to the cord cutter crowd was so intentionally enshitified a surely intentional unsync of about seconds between the visual and audio tracks it made the show practically unwatchable whats the latest proportion between these two mutually exclusive media consumption groups in the large cable tv media congromerates can still get away with cutting off the cordcutters from such real time news coverage the rnc and the dnc ought to get it together and refuse these old school media congromerates this continuing monopoly on real time news reporting haleys debate performance says a great deal about the current republican party imagine gaining attention only because you were the only candidate who was fact based and that was only some of the time more than most of them though i thought the insider take was that haley won however the main effect of this is she will get funding from the anti trump establishment up to now that has been going to desantis and scott from the point of view of the base the dial has not shifted scott is dead in the water and desantis is fading the non trump candidates are hoping trump has some health issue which takes him out short of that they are stuffed ramaswamys path is through the trump vote but only if trump drops out but like trump ramaswamy has too little support elsewhere and given his statements on climate change education funding and voting age he will mobilize an increased youth vote against him desantis is similar to ramasway vivs a vis trump and even more unlikelable with his attacks on wokeism haley can maybe get more moderates and independents but loses the trump vote as for trump with over already declaring they would never vote for him his nomination is already a loss waiting to happen conclusion no gop nominee can win because conservatism has finally reached the point where it has had to become so unhinged dishonest and dependent upon numerous small factions fascists racists fundamentalists corporate interests that are reviled by the larger remainder of the public that no amount of pr and more lies can save it from elective extinction however if they could eliminate that elective voting part of the equation then they could maybe retain power that way and that is why despite january th and all the criminal indictements conservative donors continue to support trump and the gop haley did a great job stuck to the facts attacked when needed and put the indian isolationist in his place all that was missing was her telling him to grow up if i was going to vote repub id go with haley on principal alone now here is the bad news shes a woman and nobody in the gop will vote for a woman however they will vote for a indian guy named ramaswamy because he becomes the token minority that the gop can say look we have black friends also but here is the thing ramy has already signaled his intentions he has no chance in hell of being the gop primary candidate and he know that but up on that stage he pledged his fealty to trump and trump wants a pit bull yes man thats also an minority as his vp see where this is going ramy is just wanting to be vp and use as a step stone to become potus when trump is out or dies plain and simple ramy is an isolationist national policy of avoiding political or economic entanglements with other countries ramaswamy is whatever he believes will appeal to the lowest common repug sensibilities and by extension trump he wants to be a political chameleon that never works out hes campaigning for an audience of one swamy is smarmy i think hailey was right elect a female if u want to replace bloviating with achievement haley elect her if you want a president with no spine and an opinion that changes daily depending on the wind direction its really sad that million americans think their con man actually cares about america or their own well being how do you break the cult like jim jones poison their kool aid here is my own poll from this republican presidential debate no minds no spines i agree that haley may have benefited most in the unlikely but possible event that tfg dies or is incapacitated during the primary campaign i think that haleys strength as a candidate in the general election and even in a tfg less primary has been underestimated she has mostly managed not to earn maga ire unlike pence and christie and whats left of the gop normies like her i know two time tfg voters who plan to vote for her id like to see a non fascist non maga republican even one who pretends to be a somewhat maga win the nomination for the sake of democracy in case the gop nominee wins the general but i fear that haley could win the general against biden by winning over enough independents with her feminist rhetoric softer antiabortion stance and foreign policy chops to make up for the maga and lukewarm on biden left leaning abstainers and i want biden to win i think that tfg as nominee would motivate dems and indies to vote in greater numbers and elect biden but i dont want to hope that tfg wins the nomination because shame on me and what if biden is incapacitated and tfg wins the general against harris so im doing the rbg dance on eggshells hoping biden remains viable and wins and hoping for a blue tsunami in congress vote and hoping for a blue tsunami in congress vote we need to get more people registered and then get them activated the biggest gap between eligible and registered voters in in gen z one thing that gives me hope is that the gop has landed on the wrong side of every issue that concerns gen z reproductive rights climate change gun violence the culture war attacks on woke

change gun violence prevention if you are passionate about one of these topics please write some letters for these va campaigns donald trump is the clear front runner ahead of the primaries but he didnt participate in the debate not true trump zoomed his lies from tucker carlsons stage while the gop told their lies on the debate stage the entire mess was a sick joke none of these pathetic excuses for human beings come anywhere near being qualified for anything but chief dogcatcher and probably not even that ramaswamy is a fake and a phony who doesnt believe any of the bs he spouts and defacist is so awkward its incredibly painful to even watch him and the embarrassing fake forced facial expressions he attempts fox propaganda obviously stacked the audience with pro trump the traitor people who booed on cue every time they heard anything anti trump one thing they all share is cowardice in spades the entire mess was a sick joke none of these pathetic excuses for human beings come anywhere near being qualified for anything but chief dogcatcher and probably not even that i thought the lincoln projects forecast for the debate hit on a lot of the deficiencies in the candidates jv https www youtube com watch v xjbjqxdutyg and note the title of this piece jv for junior varsity im waiting for someone to look at ramaswamy and ask this one salient question you are a vociferous support of trump so why are you running against him id love to hear his response which likely will be fantastically convoluted he thinks trump might have to drop out of the race and vivek wants to inherit trumps support its not a bad play republicans are going to sour on trump hes a moldy oldy trumps like a tv show that dragged on for too many seasons and he never stops complaining if trump was like your butcher youd start going to another shop trumps voters will break hard for the new guy ramaswany of all the candidates on stage weds he was the only one who matched if not exceeded trumps energy and his instincts for chaotic disruption you say he has no idea what hes talking about since when has that mattered to republicans not since sarah palin republican voters are only interested in being entertained and owning the libs see plus he promised to pardon trump unconditionally fearless prediction ramaswamy will win the nomination if you possibly thing that the racists known as republicans nowadays are going to vote for a president ramaswamy youre out of your mind assuming all are republicans racist is a huge miscalculation that could cost the dems votes the conservatives main motivating principle is hatred of classical liberalism and the world its created a patriarchal autocracy is their goal they thnk its the best way to insure individual liberty theyll accept support from anybody ramaswamy got the loudest longest cheers wednesday at a republican debate who do you think was cheering for him you can get excellent odds on that at an off shore betting site try paddy power why in the world do iowa republicans think being for putin and being against nato is being for america im not sure even the disinformation agents who will troll me will know but someone higher up in the ranks probably does putin runs their country the way they want america run i heard a comment from an iowa republican about the debate we love whoever the democrats hate that is the gift of rupert murdoch vladimir putin and the right wing plutocracy and none of this will mean a darn thing in the contest for the nomination haley would have been smart to moderate on transgenderism too that was a harsh note that could turn off potential supporters twenty nine percent of republican primary voters who watched wednesdays debate said that florida gov ron desantis won horse poop more like had made up their minds ahead of time and refused to change their minds despite desantis disappearing is it really that big of a surprise anyone who thinks ron desantis would make a good president is just as delusional as those that look at the time indicted unstable dunce iow exact opposite of stable genius and think i want more years of that maybe they liked him because he seemed so angry and yelled a lot maybe they just like fascists desantis won easily he doesnt need to be showy hes running on his proven track record enough said yep teachers leaving in droves spending millions of tax dollars fighting disney the largest employer in the state banning books denying the realities of covid hiring scientists who might as well be tarot card readers yeah what a record nothing in his record i could support teacher bashing rights for lgbtq us citizens attacked book banning firing public servants from the opposition party hes less than worthless going after disney disney all yours if thats what florida wants i hope your state disappears under water sooner rather than later wishing a place harm is a pretty awful thing to say won what second place in the awkward contest his proven track record is called fascism and he makes as good a nazi as hitler himself invading mexico really thats an act of war and quite frankly desantis knows it because he was taught if not in law school than in naval justice school that we dont invade other countries without significant repercussions and mexico is our number one trading partner desantis was playing maga giving raw meat to anyone who wants to dispense of rule of law whether its the law among nations and guess what our constitution states that treaties are the supreme law of the land or any legal principle that desantis doesnt want to follow desantis looses in court trump went first the illegal instigator desantis is trying to ride trumps boot straps even while trump is kicking him but trump is soon to meet lady justice face to face and his mug shot is quite revealing he is not in control while desantis is still scrapping at lady liberty its not going to bode well with either because most americans have wised up to both of them slitting throats shooting people stone dead like in the philippines no permits for guns going after prosecutors you dont agree with dismantling a highly intellectual school and making it a low grade baseball school banning abortion before a woman knows she is pregnant going after disney banning books changing real history to your fake version of it i could go on and on this man should never become our president this man should be in any elected office hahaha that proven track record of government overreach book banning and violations of free speech certainly makes an impression i just wonder how many people actually watched this garbage the other night i sure didnt does anyone know what the ratings were without his orange fraudulency on board only someone who lacks at least two brain cells synapsing would vote for anyone who says that climate change is a hoax and that there were federal law enforcement officers involved in then again those same magats are not voting for someones whose last name they cant pronounce not right but true all the same then again those same magats are not voting for someones whose last name they cant pronounce lets get real the magats wouldnt vote for him nikki haley or tim scott because of the color of their skin racism isnt a bug it is a feature for the gop especially the current virulent white nationalist that is dominant now they voted for herschel walker he was running against a black democrat plus he garnered over k fewer votes than brian kemp did in his race for governor for q ron they must have been watching something else on tv im all for this primary circus it assures no one electable is going to make the general its going to take a lot more of trumps version of winning know as losing in conventional circles to convince of the country that they are never going to succeed acting like toddlers our weekly discussion thread can be found here https www reddit com r games comments jul k weekly rgames discussion what have you been is there a way to get rid of the card popups from the bottom menu on ps my seriesx has exclusively became a tetris connected machine theres a bunch of stuff i wanna play but i cant stop playing tetris lol is demon souls replayable im trying to justify spending tax on it or just rent the game for a weekend yes and no theres the option to go through the game again doing different builds and weapons and playstyles invading and co oping with other players but the game is always the same ng doesnt give you any new content just makes things more difficult so if youre a see all the content type of player then no its not very replayable multiplayer invading and co op gave me most of my longevity when playing souls games i think so but it depends on how much you like to try different builds you cant respec and there are a fair few different ways to play theres also a fair bit of easily misable content you might want to discover world tendency for example isnt well explained and can lock you out of some specific high end weapons spells and the encounters all souls games have new game new games but your generally just replaying the same content with higher damage numbers and narrower room for error many people adore multiplayer dueling and can do that for a thousand hours but thats player specific content wise there isnt that much content i finally managed to order a ps during the latest walmart shipment says itll arrive by december nd but well see if my order gets cancelled or delayed or something before then my ps preorder from target still hasnt shipped ive called target too many times i want to explode please dont be rude to the cashiers managers at your local stores who happen to get some consoles i work nights at a walmart and we have already got complaints from a couple people wanting an xbox this store opens at am now due to covid but tuesday is our senior day and opens at am for them someone seriously complained about the seniors skipping ahead in line granny just want to pwn some n bs im just glad im at an age where i was able to fully appreciate the console evolution for playstation and its contemporaries since the very beginning videogames are s huge part of my life and have always welcomed me when i felt lonely so im thankful i was born at such a time where i could and can get the most of it heres to an exciting future so excited for thursday miles morales is calling my name i got three games pre ordered spiderman demon souls and assassins creed not sure which to play first but think i am doing spiderman will likely play astro bot before anything to check out those dualsense features for those of us who werent able to preorder for whatever reason were not going to be able to get either console for a while arent we if you frequently check online retailers and your local stores you will probably have success in finding one but with the seeming high demand and low initial stock for all the new systems they probably wont be readily available until early next year in an ideal world this is how ordering a highly in demand new product would work everybody who wants product has a full week to sign up and give manufacturer or reseller price manufacturer or reseller takes the list of people who have given them money so far and shuffles it they let you know your place in line and approximate worst case delivery date and if you dont want to let them hold your money for that long you can get a refund and walk away thereafter anybody who wants to can pay price to join the queue this is the most scalper resistant system possible because it forces them to put down money up front for every order with no guarantee that theyll be first in line it saves people the stress of f ing a busted ass walmart amazon target page only to come away empty handed allowing a full week of signups before determining order is fair to people with all sorts of different schedules and doesnt reward people with bots who can snipe first come first serve orders the fastest happy first day of the th generation of video games everyone it will be interesting to see if there are any major gameplay changes that new technologies make possible bought p royal even though p is free in the ps collection because everyone keeps saying that its worth the extra yall better be right it seems like people who had their xbox shipped from the amazon warehouse in macon ga arent getting theirs today me and several others have their ups status stuck in on its way to ups its anecdotal but heres a couple of threads https www reddit com r xboxseriesx comments jrszv anyone else ordered from amazon and got https reddit com r xboxseriesx comments jrmpcu amazon shipping gbu ag https twitter com harper status serious question is it worth getting an xbox series x just so i can play my old games on a platform that doesnt take half an hour to open a game obviously ill get games down the line but there are no xbox exclusives that interest me at the moment if you do decide to get it and only have games id highly recommend checking out game pass hundreds of games you can download and play if you can afford it then yeah im thinking about getting an s just for old games saw it on walmart added to cart hit checkout website gets hung on refresh for a minute errors out and then its sold out and added to save for later welp i tried its impossible to buy a ps online today unless youre using bots yourself im sorry its just the reality seeing how the xbox release is going pre orders being delayed amazon purchases being cancelled gamestop and units being sold out after a couple minutes of being available im just going to be patient and wait till next year same here except with the ps it really doesnt even seem all that worth it getting a ps or xbox series x s rn anyways theres no exclusive games which spider man miles morales was one of the reasons why i wanted to get a ps but then they said it was gonna be on ps too but man getting any of those consoles is such a big hassle and these companies have been handling it so badly just gonna wait to get one when god of war ragnorak and gotham knights come out otherwise ps and pc will definitely do for now waited for over an hour in the queue on the sony site got it in the cart then was told shortly after that it was expired and that i had to delete it from my cart before continuing now it says out of stock im heartbroken right now for real though demons souls is probably the best looking game ive ever played and it doesnt even run in k that just makes me think k is unnecessary p with upscaling techniques is far more than good enough and you can push higher framerates k has always felt like a weird priority it can sometimes offer noticeable benefits on large tvs but more often that not better results would come from devoting system resources toward improved lighting raytracing and art design i agree that p is plenty good for almost all circumstances and i wish thats what the tv manufacturers had been targeting all this time whats the point of putting a ps into your walmart cart if they just keep getting errors and refreshes later it goes out of stock i dont understand how bots are able to order shit when the website literally doesnt work walmart opened their xbox online orders at pm the very second it turned over i added it to my cart and by the time i got to the end of checkout they were sold out a matter of like seconds that sounds shady as fuck how does that even happen my walmart gave employees dibs before the general public i waited in line hours doors open and all were sold out i mean really gtfoh this is fucking ridiculous the literal second it went from to walmart seized up and became unresponsive even though i was already on the page just refreshing after a minute or so of errors and sorry s it came back and the ps s were gone this shit is why people will pay grand for one of these things i got to see a dualsense in action recently and its really a game changer as far as standard controllers go when you fire an automatic rifle the trigger actually pushes your finger back halfway through the trigger press after each round fired its crazy actually fucking shameful walmart adds stock to its website website gets flooded by bots to the point that the website stops loading and is unusable stock is soldout such unbelievably shitty behaviors retailers need regulatory oversight to mandate bot protection and scalping of physical goods needs to be illegal im hoping to snag a ps at target on thursday but im pretty anxious about it since they have consoles in store for pickup i think thats my best chance id love to play demon souls before next year my ps hard froze launching demons souls for the first time it froze for a few seconds during the intro movie desyncing the audio and video and making the controller unresponsive after the intro movie ended it just stayed at a black screen had to hold in the power button for seconds after that it downloaded a patch for ds and i havent had it happen since i think the system is going to have to do what the ps did and suggest you allow patches to finish downloading and installing before launching software theres a guy on twitter called wario who meticulously posts when the next gen consoles pop up for sale hes super quick about it that was the only way i was able to get a preorder in time if youre having trouble finding them try following him well after failing times to get a ps time to just wait i guess this was a good thing for demon souls is pretty steep ill hold out tell buying isnt constantly refreshing stock it still amazes me how retailers have no nothing to combat bots ps was in stock on amazon every time i hit add to cart it would say it was empty reload the page hit add to cart still empty cart for mins over and over till it was out of stock im so tired of scalpers on every product that can be resold i wish there was just some way to stop the botting and let actual people buy what they wanted what incentive do retailers have to combat bots bots or real their product stock gets sold out instantly these retailers are not in the business of making things fair theyre in the business of moving product and business is booming its kind of surprising how visually underwhelming the opening cinematics are in demon souls compared to just how damn beautiful the game itself is will there be an additional launch thread for ps releasing in other countries next week got to the store early here in japan to snag a ps only to find out that you can only reserve one to purchase by raffle for the foreseeable future fuck scalpers are having a field day fck you walmart i got to the last page to place order but then you hit me with captchas that fcked me over daily fuck you to walmart because you make me play the stupid recaptcha game for min get it in my cart and then the checkout button doesnt work walmart sold out within seconds as well guess ill try again for ps s tomorrow thursday but overall extremely disappointed that retailers didnt provide stronger protection against bots why was the issues thread removed i think its because some of the issues were found to be fake target fucking sucks i preordered on sept th in the first wave and it still stuck on preparing to ship how has every other retailer done this so much better lol walmart sold out almost instantly tried adding to cart got an error about times then it said to keep your account safe click the box below and there was no box this is what happens when theres no regulation to protect consumers none of these retailers have bot protections in place theres no laws against scalping of physical goods and the result is websites flooded by bots and scalpers selling those bot bought consoles for k personally i like console wars as it creates a competitive market i dont like fanboyism both consoles seem to be neck and neck in performance ps getting advantage right now due to its lineup anyone know if walmart cancelled the spiderman orders mines still says pending is any reason i should get a series x s if i already have gamepass on pc it seems all the big xbox releases are also going to be on pc so if i can save some money by skipping out on xbox and just getting a ps this gen that would be great there are a ton of games available on game pass console that arent available on pc i bought a cheap xbone one s so i could play all the gears games nier and a few others that arent on game pass pc im probably going to get a series s later on when theyre in stock to replace my xbone thats what i did high end pc ps is a good combo redditdetector theres a list here of gamepass games on pc and those on console console has games while pc has some that are only on the console gamepass are on pc like planet coaster or the ea games but are just not on gamepass for pc not all of the pc ones are on xbox either so theres more console only ones than the difference in number between the two while the big name xbox titles tend to be on both there are a lot of highly rated games on the console only gamepass i live in australia i preordered the ps from eb games and got the release day shipment but theres days til release and ive not heard anything about my console being shipped off yet does anyone have any information about this is it still likely that ill have it by thursday or should i just stop holding my breath for that hahahah you shou ordered from bestbuy a ps for delivery hoping i get a shipment notification asap take my money damn it oh boy the console wars crowd are really flaring up with the launch so close someone blocked me because i corrected them in their claim the ps cant play games at k nor can they reach fps this may only help west coasters but my local gamestop opened at am and had a few non preorder units in stock i think only catch was that people who didnt preorder were forced to get a bundle with the protection only catch was that people who didnt preorder were forced to get a bundle with the protection i like how youre acting like thats just a minor thing and not a complete dealbreaker to most sane people guarantee that was employees trying to increase their attach numbers wtf is that shit i thought this was illegal during past launches so a tax to buy it first man some people are crazy is there a way to actually order one of these damn things no one has had a preorder now option open for months welp was refreshing the target page for local pickup came in stock at am with left immediately added to cart tried to check out got stuck at the final step wouldnt load the next page refresh item out of stock gg wp just happened again only on best buy aaaaand again on walmart had it in my cart was literally waiting for the place order page to load and it booted me out saying theyre out of stock honestly this is fucking ridiculous it must be bots i have no idea how else they could sell their entire stock in under seconds we should fully expect the reseller market to continue until you can buy these in stores with ease stockx has listings for all consoles ps disc version currently selling at around dozens and dozens of sales today its easy money for these people same as sneakers what a joke walmart com is horrible the first time it made me re enter my credit card info when it was added a week ago the second and third time my delivery address disappeared and i had to re enter that by that time they are all gone are they screwing with peoples login info as someone who only had a ps for about a year after launch but also has a decent gaming pc ps is the obvious choice right with the ps collection other ps games ive missed i should be looking at a big library yup and if xbox ever delivers a great exclusive you have game pass pc since persona is apart of the ps collection i am tempted to go back to it and get the platinum trophy since i got the platinum for royal earlier this year gonna miss all of the qol changes and sumi from royal though did anyone manage to get one from walmart i got to the cart put in my info had to click submit multiple times due to errors happening and then it said sold out why it didnt reserve a stock for me when i put it in my cart i do not know so i didnt pre order one in canada i put my name on a first to know list at my local eb games like a week ago i didnt know that they were doing launch day online only so after work today i went to my local walmart to see what the scoop was no consoles went to eb no consoles i come home kinda sad pissed off because i know that bots likely bought all the consoles sit down at my computer start redditing my phone rings its eb games wtf i pick up congratulations youre on our first to know list and were letting you know you can pick up a playstation console tomorrow what the fuck people pre ordered legitimately and have to wait until next week i randomly put my name on a first to know list a week ago and i get my console tomorrow not a gloat post at all i just cant really believe my luck im speechless got my ps today and wow it is amazing coming from xbox which wasnt used much as a single player gamer i felt like a kid again booting it up and playing astro the controller is excellent and the value from ps plus is phenomenal happy i went with sony this gen some people have reported their series x failling doesnt seem to be widespread but worth keeping an eye on https twitter com roninstrife status https twitter com kaj maru status https twitter com gilicohdv status some of those videos are provably fake as you can see mentioned in the replies stuff like being originally posted in august or from people who publicly stated they werent buying the series x etc not saying there arent failures as is the case with electronics in general but that these videos are to likely be taken with a grain of salt his first comment after it happens is a nonchalant you wonder why playstationn sells more and his account going back weeks is super toxic im betting fake maybe someone on the back unplugging the console or something wouldnt be a console launch without a viral video of someones console exploding nowinstock net has been a poor choice for ps alerts half the time i dont hear an alert and when i do the product is out of stock by that time is there an alternative as much as i hate still using aa batteries that dual sense runs out of power pretty damn quick its a really cool controller but its pretty frustrating it might be because you were playing astro bot that your controller was dying quick because it is constantly using all of the built in features i felt mine lasted quite a long time while playing spiderman best chance for a launch console still needs sites any stores anything thanks in the us youll want to check online with target walmart and maybe best buy or amazon at midnight one tiny thing im loving about quick resume is that i can sneak in minutes of gaming before my carpool arrives because it literally takes seconds or less to start playing from the console being off review of xbox series x controller is slightly improved grip dpad feels good console is extremely painless to setup probably the easiest ive ever done load times are drastically improved across the board and fps is much improved on games like halo anniversary graphics for k went from ish to a constant quick resume is dope easily switch between up to games wherever youre at in them and it even carries over through a hard reset not many series x optimized games yet but the ones that are like ori look absolutely incredible k supersampled down to k fps stunningly gorgeous the auto hdr on old games is really cool too along with their k ai upscaling old games look better than ever im planning to play through psychonauts on it as well as black maybe one of the fables overall not a must buy for any new gen games obviously since they committed to keep releasing for the old consoles for at least a year but if youre looking for improved performance load times interested in backwards compatible game upgrades and want to utilize quick resume to save time it does all that very well if you have a k tv but still the original xbox one its absolutely the time to upgrade and with game pass acquiring ea play this week combined with the backwards compatibility provides a deceivingly huge launch lineup of older games not disappointed at all in my purchase looks like i wont be able to get one until april that sucks pretty bad https www gamespot com articles xbox series x s supply shortages expected to last for months id consider being an early adopter of a ps but i just think how the games i want are may as well wait months to a year and grab second hand copies for with possibly a couple more exclusive games is there a wired version of the xbox controller looking to use it for pc but my pc does not have bluetooth i believe you can plug in any of the xbox series controllers via usb c if youre looking for one thats only wired i dont think ms has made one since the days just plug a usb c cable into a normal xbox series controller bt doesnt work for it right now anyway you can buy a little wireless connector thats what i use plugs into usb real talk all the articles about peoples dead xboxs and shit are the dumbest things ive ever seen in my life in what world do of a hardware software products units work all the time what a shit post way to try and get bait views contact the company get a refund send the xbox in and move on like everyone else if i wrote to news articles every time i bought a new stick of memory or any sort of pc hardware that just wasnt working id be insta famous i feel like you werent around during the red ring of death this is how it started so thats it walmart was our last hope of getting a ps on the topic of scalping i wonder if it would be possible for the major re seller venues like ebay and amazon and that sort of thing to agree that in the interests of consumers they would have a moratorium on selling any used major consumer electronics within say months of its launch that means no ps s no gtx s etc this wouldnt harm legitimate used product sellers since they shouldnt be done with it that quickly anyway but it would be a strong disincentive against resellers since product supply chains could likely reach actual customers by then sure there would always be shady black market places people could find these things but this should still sweep a lot of potential customers off the table making scalping much less profitable that would require them to be moral companies remember corporations are considered people but they are not held to such standard they get a of the sale so a move like this would certainly be pro consumer but bad for business people want to part with their money for double the price of retail ebay gets twice the profit they become a second reseller in this and they literally dont have to do anything the losers are the actual consumer and dont expect morals when there is money to be made sony gets paid resellers get paid ebay gets paid theres no problem in their eyes the ps has some shitty bugs man like right now i cant launch demons souls like it just wont start other games no problem but demons souls doesnt work anymore had no problems all week until now if anyone hasnt gotten a chance to preorder may i suggest using nowinstock net if you want to buy one on launch day you can sign up for notifications or follow the chat which is usually really helpful congrats to xbox and playstation gamers both consoles are looking pretty sweet after seeing the xbox series x quick resume in action i really really want one for my living room eventually so ive been out of the loop for a while but are there like no new games that arent cross gen no truly next gen only exclusives to show off the new hardware i swear it feels like the first time this has ever happened and im really saddened to hear it new consoles used to mean new games demons souls is the big one miles morales is excellent and astros playroom is really cool and shows off how great the dualsense controller is the demons souls remake is apparently also great but granted thats not truly a new game reading all these comments makes me feel really lucky to have been able to preorder before they sold out at my local gamestop i hope everyone can get one soon this has been a real shit show can someone tell me whether sackboy gets good in the way that mario games get good later on i already have it and im going to play it either way but i want to avoid going in with the wrong expectations and come away disappointing i dont expect it to be as good as mario d world but im hoping for some more interesting challenges later on than what ive seen in videos of the early game anyone know how quick resume works with physical games on xbox can i suspend a game remove the disc put it back in later and pick up where i left off saudi officials are killing hundreds of women and children out of view of the rest of the world while they spend billions on sports washing to try to improve their image fuck me that was grim reading thats why i think we should ignore saudi league alltogether here because it is not about football it is about sports washing a year old boy said border guards forced him and other survivors to rape two girl survivors after the guards had executed another migrant who refused to rape another survivor all described scenes of horror women men and childrens bodies strewn across the mountainous landscape severely injured already dead and dismembered first i was eating with people and then they were dying said one person there are some people who you cannot identify because their bodies are thrown everywhere some people were torn in half jesus fucking christ this is one of the worst things i have read they do this shit and then pretend to be some sort of godly nation hypocritical pricks i mean anyone with half an education knows what theyre doing and doesnt support it the problem is most of the world is ignorant to this stuff and doesnt care to learn anything theyre not ignorant to it they just care more about money the more we support fan owned clubs the better things will be for the future of football i think the prem is too balls deep in dirty money at this point eddie howe i havent really given it too much thought and when you ask newcastle fans its just a shrug of the shoulders from them since the greenwood and saudi incident i have lost lot of faith among football fans things i saw on twitter regarding greenwood saudi takeover qatar united takeover is absolutely grim they are not even hiding it anymore i saw an edit of homelander quotes you need me dialogue painted in positive way for greenwood which had k likes what the fuck are we living in dystopia or what i am sympathetic to a lot of our fans who say theyre tired of the partisan jibes and that theyre just supporting our club like they always have that were not unique in that respect and i agree that doing so does not make us as fans complicit in the crimes of the saudis anymore than man utd fans would be answerable for mason greenwood or the duplicity of their board but the collective indifference of a lot of fans has been really depressing to witness like yes we arent answerable for the saudi regime but fuck me we could at least do something protest outside the saudi arabia friendlies being held at st james a wor flags display commemorating some of the victims of the saudis anything to register that we dont like our club being the plaything of a brutal petro state each and every single person who has hand waved away the fact that saudi arabia and qatar are using sports to launder their image should be forced to read this article daily this should be posted on all the highlights and transfer rumors for the saudi league its sad how little people give a shit about newcastle being saudi owned especially since the greenwood stuff shows it is possible for the public to gather together and oppose immoral behaviours by a football club hearing people talk about how well theyre running the club and that theyre doing well without even spending that much yet is actually sickening and just shows how full of shit so many people are with their selective moral outrage especially since the greenwood stuff shows it is possible for the public to gather together and oppose immoral behaviours by a football club i am always astonished how little pl fans trust the power of concentrated and proper outrage in germany fans are climbing fences when you raise standing tickets above or play monday games and thats why these ideas are quickly thrown out the window and the french are fucking world champs at any protest with greenwood it showed that something can be made happen when enough people do care but in most cases its just a resounding meh wouldnt change anything anyway and anyone whos invested in a cause is laughed at meanwhile in newcastle oh no but women can drive now attitudes towards women are improving according to the cuntish shills on here as they still kill and multilate and oppress them regularly fucking wank stains seriously fuck any of these money grabbing cunts who went and played or managed over there to legitimise this regime theyve actively exposed themselves as terrible human beings for me and if henderson ever plays for england again then its a sackable offence i know newcastle fans will come into a lot of stick for their behaviour but it isnt their fault that the club theyve supported all their life now lies in the hand of a murderous state the entire blame rests on the premier league and ultimately the government deals like this should never be sanctioned countries with such awful human rights records shouldnt be courted by western diplomats and we certainly shouldnt be selling them arms and weapons like in the uk and i imagine the us too people are all over this thread calling out newcastle fans theyre just working class football fans for the most part who have had their club taken the real problem is a government that would allow our game be turned into a plaything of murderous states theyre the only ones with power in this scenario newcastle fans should be more vocal about saudi arabia actions because they need to see that sportwashing doesnt work even to people who support your club greenwood saga gave me confidence that people care more about morals than football so i really hope we will see some protest against saudi before or during newcastle games its a no win situation i havent given a penny to the club since the takeover and i dont plan to but you get people on both sides going at you for either being a virtue signaller trying to bring newcastle united down or a genocide enabler when the takeover went through i would talk about my unease but it always just ends up in shit flinging from all sides so i just end up keeping my feelings to myself most of the time i am and get downvoted for being a hypocrite and sent awful dms from fans of other clubs calling me a murderer for having a newcastle flair genuinely cant win as everyone assumes im in favour of the takeover from the flair alone but but generation wealth they have the right to get the bag kings you would do the same the dumb fucks that spam shit like that on every saudi post should be tied to a chair and forced to read and see atrocities that those monsters commit gotta secure that wealth so their great great great great grandson can own a private jet without working a day in his life makes you want to hate the sport you love support local lower league if you can where community still matters the likes of ronaldo and co that decide to go play out there are pretty despicable no way they dont know what saudi is about yet they decide to go there for all that money i couldnt give a shit what ronaldo donates to charity hes just as bad messi is also a saudi ambassador you hate him too you know i would agree with you if you didnt only target the saudis we gonna criticise beckham or any other player who goes to the us with their massive amount of war crimes in iraq and afghanistan this energy is always only directed at players going to saudi absolutely awful apart from boycotting sjp refusing to buy the shiny new adidas shirt and being vocal about how much i hate the saudis what else can i do nothing in the uk by an individual or small group of individuals will impact saudi policy internally or externally yeah the people shitting on newcastle fans are virtue signaling cunts genuinely think theyre better than you cuz they dont support newcastle as if u had any sort of control in the matter the uk government sells weapons to the saudis the fa and epl allowed them to buy your club the media looks the other way to what theyre doing its not right that you feel like youre the one letting newcastle down come on now what did sarah jessica parker do this time one million iraqis dead and no one in this sub said anything about the morals of messis move to the mls before you downvote me explain to me why they deserved to die the mls isnt owned by the government that committed such atrocities stop with the whataboutism im pretty sure if someone from bidens cabinet was spearheading the mls project people would lose their heads too youre the one who needs to explain why you think the mls killed one million iraqis because the us government dont own inter miami its got absolutely nothing to do with the geographical location of the league its because the people committing war crimes funding terrorists and torturing journalists are the same people who own newcastle and a couple of the saudi teams its not hard to understand they dont they fail to forget saudi arabia learnt sports washing with their american buddies no need to go to iraq or even to the past any saudi atrocities in yemen has usa and the whole west hands on it as well why people here pretending that saudi arabia is a pariah state that works alone theres also the undercovered aspect that the us military has provided funding weapons and training to the saudi border security https open substack com pub thecolumn p biden administration funding and r c i utm medium ios utm campaign post the us has better pr the us govt doesnt own mls clubs mls is not being used to make the us govt look good in front of the world if you want to use messi as an example hes taking saudi money to promote their world cup bid against argentina uruguays bid just posted a very similar comment big ups to you for recognising both sides of the issue people wanna shout whataboutism dont even know what that means lol btw im from india so lest we forget the crimes of the uk monarchs themselves if not the pioneers they definitely perfected the guidebook on pillaging messi being a piece of shit doesnt mean saudi arabia isnt a piece of shit nobody needs to explain anything to you you need to be less stupid https en wikipedia org wiki slavery in saudi arabia then explain to me why saudi arabia was the center of slave trade what did the sudanese and ethiopians for example do to the arabs to deserve this or the circassian or georgian or syrian or indian women ho had to work as sex slaves in the harems the united states has killed hundreds of thousands of people funny how sports washing is never used in that context because the us government dont own the sports teams dumbass so its got nothing to do with them the saudis that kill innocent people are the same ones paying ronaldos wages or buying players for newcastle they didnt sport washed their actions theyve democracy washed them lol saudi arabia is really bad but the united states are even worse i see they are not just trying to kill football fucking gross if true it is absolutley horrendous and should be condemed by every means possible however the only real evidence if anyone bothered to read the article is eye witness testimony that being said i absolutley dont doubt that terrible things happened in that region the saudi yameni boarder is a lawless place and technically still a war zone being a migrant alone makes one in an extermely vulnerable position now imagine that in a war zone that being said lets all now witness the backwards logic of the idea of sportswashing bringing a country in the spotlight does not rinse its image it just highlights its imperfections and flaws now should this sub be turned into a a place where we post about countries boarder agencies foreign policy and domestic politics should we post about migrants drawing in the sea due trying to reach europe should we post about the spanish wolfpack rape case what about israeli apartheid anytime an israeli player and team is in the news no one is pretending saudi is perfect but i dont see anyone critiquing the tory party everytime the pl is posted here or bolsonaros treating of the amazon when he was president when posting a flamengo goal or the us drone attack that killed afghani civillians or the the video that julian assange leaked and made him a target by the us and uk governaments this is such a huge false equivalence its crazy the reason we dont talk about israeli players the tory party atrocities that happen in spain migrants dying trying to enter europe is because the israeli government dont own newcastle the tory party dont own multiple clubs in a league they are buying world famous player to play in purely to sportswash the owners of crystal palace didnt brutally mutilate and torture a journalist the galzers arent currently at war with yemen and killing children daily the second the state of israel own a football team in the prem then we will talk about it israeli apartheid on r soccer rather than political subs and as much as i fucking hate the tories youd either be unbelievably stupid or deliberately mislead to even try to say theyre even slightly as bad as the saudi royal family last i checked sunak didnt torture someone because they spoke out against him bro dont waste your time this is the exact type of racism we should fight against but media tells us racism is a lot more simple than that and is actually more about catching someone slipping and uttering a single word rather than confronting everyones own little biases just a reminder women players successfully revolted against having a visit saudi sleeve ad for the world cup when players stand up united against something they can enact change so why is it necessary to type women and children when they are killing everyone invokes a deeper emotional response from the reader sales this is what happens when people know there are literally no consequences to their actions when you can do anything you want to another person and you are risking absolutely nothing this is what raw humanity is when stripped of its laws respect or empathy its very sad that there are people having to experience this while the rich continue to get richer by showing support to the people responsible for it i see a lot of comments criticising newcastle fans for just blindly supporting their club and not speaking out but wtf are the rest of you doing other than complaining on here you see so many rivals fans being vocal about this stuff in these threads but you never take it any further why arent you protesting why arent you setting an example you never see anything at premier league games youre all talk and just as much to blame for letting it happen as everyone else its almost like youll just use it as attack ammo and then just conveniently forget about it and move on with your lives once you leave the thread if fans of teams like arsenal actually gave a shit about this stuff theyd be protesting their kit and stadium sponsor but they dont at least bayern did they just walk around with it proudly on their chest while criticising others look what kind of abuse you get for calling out others for not doing anything either you supporters of state owned sportswashing clubs have to stick together i see no one should be surprised about this also dont forget about their war in yemen its easy to forget about that since its been going on for so long okay i dont watch newcastle games what is there to do well i suppose newcastle fans could have started with not wearing towels on their head and cheering in the streets when they were bought out the the saudis beyond that protest about as much as the rest of us can do the saudi regime is undoubtedly one of the worst on the planet but theyre a key strategic ally of the majority of the world powers so theyll continue to be supplied with weapons and a blind eye will be turned to each and every action of theirs be vocal europe needs energy oil and gas from saudi middle east especially after ukraine russia war breakdown of relationship between europe west and iran while venezuela still heavily being sanctions the west also needs the saudis to be on their side especially in these multi polar world with china increasingly becoming a threat china russia military alliances more and more countries especially in africa abandoning democracies leaning more toward russia and china saudis as a strategic western allies have become a lot more important compare to years ago in addition the west lost the war in afghanistan the taliban victory conquering afghanistan have further decrease the western influence in that part of the world middle east central asia south asia region therefore the saudis and middle east countries importance to the west is right now at all time high geopolitics economy and security are the most important aspect for the western countries human women lgbt rights doesnt worth shit and would be thrown into the trash bin the west needs middle eastern countries more than ever so they would entertain and humor saudis as much as their can enabling the saudis to sports wash their country is just a small concession to make from the west in term of the bigger picture no matter how much you scream complain there is nothing you can do to stop it waiting for messi to hit us with another visit saudi post messi is an ambassador of saudi arabia remember one thing if were talking about sports washing saudi arabia are rookies in comparison to the usa as theyve done it for decades how did they learn to do it ill be glad to hear someone saying otherwise saudi officials are killing hundreds of people while doing big business with the usa uk and the eu you cannot lay the moral guilt of this on football fans if you critique this horrible act do not allow apologist of the saudi government to bully you out of the argument by them saying well you know the west fill in the blank with a western country and some previous heinous act we can be both people who condemn previous and current crimes the genocide in yemen is supported by the uk and us btw why are they signalling out the women and children men are also getting killed men also need to be seen as victims just say people next time way too many people will ignore this and then act confused why others dont want the money of the saudi government changing this sport in their favor im so tired of europeans indirectly supporting this backwards monarchy and its attempt to shift to tourism in order to survive its long overdue end that would come with the transition to renewable energy the only thing these monarchs have going for them is that they basically bribe their population into obedience why i want the west to push harder for green energy save the planet fuck the saudis but theyre a us friendly oil rich country so its ok right s unfortunately the footballing world has laid out the red carpet for saudi teams to join the ucl it is going to happen in the coming years they will be invited who will suffer from it the smaller european leagues who will have to make way for the money its a collective disgrace the players that not only fill their pockets there but promote the league also the clubs that pay no mind to play a super cup in saudi arabia and get sponsored from there i e the new spanish super cup and the leagues visit saudi that allow these investors to use football clubs as their sports washing machine of course the federations fifa and uefa everything for the sake of money football will still be football elite professional football not so much just a way for rich owners to keep on being rich and make sure the money doesnt trickle down to other clubs i wish r soccer keep the same energy about america killing thousands of people worldwide every year literally every big powerful country is killing innocent people everywhere including countries of top league disgusting country yet again this is why no one should take this league seriously outside of local supporters its not about the clubs or the players this is what matters ban the saudi league from this sub but they signed tonali horrific reading same old in the comments where all the blame is on the newcastle fans as if we ourselves got the saudis in and apparently never criticise the regime at all if only we were as righteous as the reddit user who would definitely stop supporting their club instantly and not just morally posture and enjoy the reddit karma using weapons theyve bought from the us im assuming are sports teams the only ones that need to stay away from saudis what about countries selling them arms and allowing saudis to invest and profit in their countries these actions directly facilitate fund human right abuse and violence keeping them only from sports teams hardly means anything wish papers go hard on govts facilitating all this papers have no spine to criticize the govts so they go after soft targets like sports teams imagine whats going to happen if climate change forces this kind of migration onto of the worlds population itt europeans who are fine with a policy of actively drowning migrants at sea shocked just shocked to see migrants mistreated your crocodile tears are just too much same with my fellow americans even biden has a criminal policy vs migrants sports washing works ask a geordie horrible but lets be honest nobody really cares who has the power to do anything about it china has been doing horrible stuff to the uighurs for years and despite something of a hue and cry nobody really did anything of significance to stop it western hyprocrites will criticize this but then go and kill hundreds of people in counterstrike thank god that america germany england and rest of the global elite dont kill and never didnt kill and nevermind what they did in yemen oh wait the west was giving them weapons and intel the entire time ah well somehow not as bad as abusing one person dont get me wrong both are terrible but one is magnitudes worse like the usa china russia europ have been doing and still doing the exact same thing ohhh hypocrisy of the west looove me some of that yeah the usa does the exact same thing america killed millions in iraq bombed millions in syria and other countries and continues its terrorism yet i dont see people ignoring mls or having the same energy towards mls i know wrongs dont make a right but why the hypocrisy the rape cases and a lot of the stuff in the article is pretty heinous but you realize america lied to the public that saddam had weapons of mass destruction then spent years destroying iraq afghanistan and now syria on a war that cost americans trillion dollars the deaths of military children who fought in these regions and countless local citizen lives just to hand it right back to the taliban and formally declaring a banking blackout and causing a current massive famine the only people by the way won this war was military industrial complex stockholders and many of the senators who voted for it are still in office and were exactly supporting freedom fries many of our boomer ass parents all were guilty of being dumb enough to fall for the false information paraded around then happily supported the government as if nothing happened while signing up their kids for war who also mostly came back with exactly the mental instabilities you get from invading foreign land and needing to defend yourself from a people who want to murder you i really feel like the focus of saudi sportswashing is wildly misguided considering people in the united states have a lot of fucking work to do to account for and stop its own massive evils which are orders of magnitude more than whatever the saudis are doing like im not supposed to watch the nfl now because country bad i would basically only be allowed to watch swiss curling if that were the case very sad to see the club ive supported all my life become a laundering operation for these authoritarian monsters dont worry about it r soccer will always be here to explain away the behaviour of the middle east quick post another ronaldo highlight i still dont get how their sports washing is supposed to work for me it seems like that their tyrannical muderous regimes are getting more exposed than if they would have stayed silent this horrendous regime is trying to look good on paper with their modernisation efforts opening up for investments in other sectors etc whats sad is some unthinking folk believe their sporting project aka sports washing to be fine and gullibly buy into their propaganda howay the lads though as you walk around with fly emirates proudly plastered on your chest we all know this and yet the backlash of saudi owning newcastle is less than the backlash of mason greenwood dont get me wrong fuck greenwood but it really shows you how much of a hypocrite the media is true same goes for the u s and in a more general sense to the entire modern civilization rich people from all of our countries with assistance from all of our governments are and have been doing dispeakable things in africa in other underdeveloped locations and to their own working class we rebrand our culture with things like sports its nice for the west to have a mirror to look at an arab person being on the other side makes it more complex but some form of xenophobia wouldve had to be in this scenario anyway the saudi scholars who speak on the establishment are given year to life sentences with abuse no one wants to hear the oil couldnt have been handed to worse people every single bomb and bullet used by these fuckers have been provided by the west uk us and de hypocrisy at it highest almost people died among which were children in this war that has been going on since no one cares protest if you want change dont click on hit pieces anyone with a brain knows what saudi is doing fuck them and their shit league russia saudi makes sense and they are killing those people with weapons provided by nato you can cut the middle man and protest there some human beings are the worst things to exist in the universe but we already knew that i feel horribly conflicted about all of this i love the players i love the fans i love the city but we are being used to reform the image of despicable people and i hate it makes me feel sick the club has been tarnished i still get excited by our successes but a sense of hollowness persists longer than any glory i do often feel however that we as a fanbase are being asked to make sacrifices by people who have made none themselves you should be under no illusion the entire pl is being used its not just newcastle you may feel aloof and morally superior but you also have a voice i see no protests from other fanbases when we come to play and our away section is always full the difference is that you are not being asked to turn your backs on your clubs the silence is deafening you are right of course the premier league has been a playground for bored billionaires and petro states for a while now newcastle are just the latest propaganda project on the block its amazing that the clubs only choice was between an incompetent parasitic owner and a competent murderous regime soo happy the sport is filled with these sport washing projects s yet those players dont give a shit what are we the average football fan supposed to do complain protest nothing happens when money talks dont read the comments under the youtube video jesus fucking christ and we are funding it all with our dependence on fossil fuels and for the americans in the thread dont forget that ksa funded using nato countries supplied weapons yes go somewhere else with your hypocrisy while we in asia are excited about watching a super league with top stars in domestic time zone fun fact did you know that el classico just meant ronaldo vs messi for those outside of their respective clubs that is the power of football stars and the amount of tv money they can bring in apologies to epl saudi is a despot regime but im not quite sure how different this is from italian ships firing on migrants reddit seemed to be okay with that type of attack on migrants i dunno it seems to me that saudi arabia is a reprehensible government and that the world has been largely violent towards migrants and people escaping war zones and poverty for a better life this is why as far as im concerned i wont spend a minute watching the saudi league theyve been doing for years and the west is happy to continue their business dealings with them buying their oil and selling them advanced arms and weapons i find it hypocritical that this only now becomes an outrage and is getting attention because theyre snatching players off european teams and have become a legitimate treat on the transfer market newcastle fans oiiiii and stan kroenke and the glazers under pay their employees exactly the same but x any european country did atrocities too in the past so whats the problem you hypocrites i strongly advise anyone who argues like this to read a book about history specifically about slave trade feel like we should ban posts about the saudi league on this sub mods please i beg dont allow them to have any attention just a quick reminder for anyone in this thread that they all bought these weapons from the us for over billion dirtbags theyve been doing this type of shit for a while too sick fucking people disgusting theres a decent portion of the uk that would be happy if we did this with our migrants the demonisation of them in the press is horrific welcome to the camel league newcastle fans still feasting and dress like them nothing to see here amazon documentary is out saudis are great also eddie howe says fake news this but the uks asylum system is inhumane when we literally give asylum seekers free accommodation and food not just saudi most gulf countries are awful have they thought of the generational wealth the players will get though can someone explain why people from ethiopia want to smuggle into a country that is so brutal its like jews trying to smuggle back into nazi germany just wondering what theyre hoping to accomplish its amazing how sports can whitewash current situations soccer is irrelevant when it comes to geopolitics ive always been dying to know how sports washing works and how is it supposed to make me feel about saudi arabia i dont think any more highly of them now than before yh but newcastle got into ucl s oh i can just imagine what the majority of comments in this therad are going to be like strange how no one really cared about what was going on in saudi arabia until our takeover but now every fan of every other club has impeccable morals and were all disgusting for support the team we have done our whole lives elsewhere in africa everybody should read about the genocide that the arab supremacist rsf is currently conducting in sudan we sent a un mission to the darfur region about years ago but that hasnt stopped the rsf who descend from the janjaweed that perpetrated the genocide at the time from trying again yes the saf is propping up an undemocratic regime but the rsf is miles worse why is this relevant because the uae are one of the biggest allies of the rsf hemedti the rsf leader is close friends with the uae leadership personally meeting with sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan as recently as and the uae chad sudan air bridge is one of the reasons why they are able to continue tearing apart darfur and sudan as a whole several months into the civil war but basically nobody ive met knows that the uae is directly sponsoring this ethnic cleansing like this sports washing doing a great job here then eh they are crossing a border in an extremely bloody warzone accompanies by armed houthi smugglers i would be surprised if they werent killed not supporting this in any facet neither do i condone any whataboutery but i never see any articles posted about the sheer pillaging and raping the so called st world countries have done to the rd world countries lets acknowledge both of these issues as wrong and bring them both to light it is not whataboutery if i am seeking a fair coverage on issues either side of the border see usa supplying weapons to saudi to feed their war in yemen or see iraq iran afghanistan and the countless other regimes they have toppled for their own benefit meanwhile leaving a mass grave of civilians and multiple countries and their government in disarray whys newcastle getting all the shit what about city what if its true and what if it isnt probably of you watched the world cup hop off those high horses i didnt wait until you hear about the united states military but ronaldo said land of allah tho these are totally religious folks so how many people have uk killed over the years at palestine how many families have they destroyed how many children they left alone without their families stop the hypocrisy and stop believing everything you read online the world cant do anything about that they are us allies literally just murdering migrants im not a saudi bot but this has nothing to do with football you can share the crimes of many different countries so everyone in here whos grandstanding about morals and ethics yall gonna follow these rules right no interacting with any cr content no interacting with any saudi league content probably shouldnt support anything fifa then right so def no more watching world cup mmm nah no more euro prolly no more watching cl since loads of oil money oof also no prem then huh or did did you arbitrarily draw your self righteous line in the sand conveniently around all of these things since they arent quite as awful you can support the club and not the ownership you know oh yes but dont you see the newcastle fans trying to change the topic or give out whataboutisms at least with united r reddevils hasnt defended mc at the rate the newcastle fans are with saudi remindme month did the us not murder thousands of civilians in their wars in the middle east are we banning the mls too people on here have a short memory sure did those people should go to jail how does that make what the saudis are supposedly doing right let me go a set further all countries have done something shit in their past every single one of them dose that mean that we cant point out something shit that is happening right now the other difference here is that saudi royal family is the direct or indirect owner of these saudi teams and the saudi royal familly is the saudi government the us government on the other hand is not the direct or indirect owner of any mls teams by that logic no country every should be allowed to host a football league as long as everyone is greenlighting transfers to saudi arabia because players are following the money tell me what does a story like this means that they are sportswashing should be an open secret since the beginning a disgusting place run by the worst people to ever exist where are all the newcastle fans i mean anyone with half a brain can see why saudi could never be charged with unlawful war crimes for the situation in this article beyond the uk us and eu benefitting from this war financially because of arms deals with saudi this all lines up with their own foreign policies in regards to relations with iran the houthi src government is being fought with because of its strong relations with iran and the obvious anti western and anti imperialist stance of both governmental bodies ultimately this is a proxy war between iran and saudi where with the help of the src the iranians can establish a satellite state that can key strategic placement in targeting the gcc the saudis can very easily argue that they are deterring the migration of potential terrorist threats from the src government because they are in active war with them i think furthermore what a lot of people dont understand about this conflict is that the saudis are supporting the republic of yemen a democratic republic who suffered a military coup in at the hands of the src who took over the capital city of sanaa saudi is not blockading all of yemen they are blockading an insurgency group that controls about a fourth of the entire state but most of the populous regions both republics have been reprimanded for their lack of discrimination in regards to civilian casualties the conflict has resulted in child soldiers and targeted attacks on civilian areas from both sides which has led to both being blacklisted by the un i am not trying to make the death of the ethiopian migrants seem any less barbaric or wasteful but i am bringing the context to light which so many people on this sub about football are clearly not aware of in the slightest obviously all the security personnel at the border should be harshly punished for their actions and they should obviously know how to be more discerning but in reality this is no different than the us drone striking civilians in syria or israel bombing palestinians in the eyes of the un and all global judiciary bodies attention newcastle fans hope youre enjoying your shiny new transfers it is very disappointing to know a world where all the human right feminist stuff only focus on disney movie but left no eyes open on what really happening in the world and still we have people who support city and newcastle without feeling guilt absolutely disgusting anyone who signs for a saudi club is indirectly responsible for this the saudi government is a pure form of evil man city fans dont care saudi arabia has nothing to do with city but its not newcastles owners murdering people its been categorically denied that its ultimately run and funded by mbs yawn its not the fans of nufc starved for success that have turned a blind eye on a bloodthirsty evil regime and sported turbans as an ironic gesture yawn people need to wake up and get the saudi regime out of not just football but all sport and e sports golf football f csgo whatever your poison despite newcastle being sauidi owned we wont see of the media coverage of the united and greenwood case got maybe womens lives matter less if they dont live in the west yeah with the type of rhetoric in the usa i wouldnt be surprised if some politicians looked at this in envy and yearn especially with talk about illegal migration and border crossing theyve never had to deal with mike ashley though those ethiopians have it easy well it worked for qatar didnt it how many of us boycotted the world cup try to improve their image theyre succeeding thats whats concerning not killing people would do wonders for their image i wonder why they didnt try that first imagine your club was owned by these guys they need to implement some sort of protection like the nfl does in america the nfl requires that at least of the team must be owned by one person or a family acting together this person must also be a largest stakeholder they are the owner in effect so they can go into league meetings representing the entire organization so that eliminates investment groups from being able to take ownership of the team an example of this was when there were reports that the saudis pif was funding the bid submitted by brian davis for the commanders however that offer was never taken seriously by the nfl its sad but true i wonder how players feel when they read about stuff like this in the papers like it has to feel like shit waving their flag and reading this cruelty ofc its no different in other countries but here its such an open secret you would have to walk around blindfolded to not see it and im very sure what we read about the saudis recently is just the tip of the mount everest yeah and the united states is funding them but they dont wanna talk about that sky is blue why gme what is drs low karma apes feed the bot here superstonk discord

ensured the greed and corruption never happened again excellent work from pb thanks for sharing welp also i want to add something that i strongly believe has contributed to the evil widening wealth gap situation we now find ourselves in ryan cohen has made it very well known that his thing is not hurting shorts nor is it revamping market structure etc his thing is addressing the gross overcompensation of ceos board members and other directors funneling profits to themselves even when they havent invested a dime of their own money instead of spreading the wealth down to the rest of the organization this is old school and a threat to the current status quo in corporate america for reference compare the ratio of average ceo pay to average worker pay in vs today hint vs this hoarding of so much wealth by the people at the top has had devastating consequences to our society which now finds itself with the biggest wealth gap in the history of mankind just one of the reasons i find it so easy to get behind this man and i hope this doesnt offend you but this is why im such a pulte fan as well i think rc and pulte have a similar vision of wut should be and are going to make

a book i recently listened to trade wars are class wars klein and pettis trace the origins of todays trade wars to decisions made by politicians and business leaders in china europe and the united states over the past thirty years across the world the rich have prospered while workers can no longer afford to buy what they produce have lost their jobs or have been forced into higher levels of debt i recommend listening if youre interested in this macro historic perspective on countries and economic class its an incredibly detailed and well researched book the creature from jekyll island

job if you need your job you cannot ask for a raise and will keep taking abuse from management and work as many hours as they want you to for the same pay its a never ending vicious circle that was created by the federal reserve and the cabal that runs it great write up theres just so so much you can go into with the fed this is just scratching the surface this is the kind of stuff that keeps me

reposting here welp hell yea bud pb is top notch dd ohh ffs we just got done with the anti sec fud now we have anti fed fud remember kids orgs are made up of people and they are the ones who can be corrupted not orgs and as far as jpow is concerned he is the one raising rates finally bringing this free money bubble to an end forced or by free will that i donot know but he is a heck of a lot better than his predecessor ben bernanke who was there during the bailouts and literally gave away money at the same time refusing to put any conditions on banks as to how the bailout was to be spent and so they all gave themselves huge bonuses payouts powell should have raised rates years ago and he tried but cowered when truump pressured him to back off hes as guilty as all the rest of them no cell no sell ya gawwwwwwdamn right peteszahh nft masta im going to call it dont couple this stuff to gme dollar going away and hyperinflation isnt going to happen housing is its own bag of wet hair and i hope it crashes soon but even housing isnt trending in the direction of all this economy is falling dollar is worthless crap digital currencies and the dollar not being the king international currency is possible but all the other things are a zerohedge wet dream and very difficult to make happen even if they wanted to theyre either morons or geniuses not both if theyre genius why havent they succeeded already do i need to refer you back to gamestopped hearings again for how on the ball they are drs and hedge but this shit isnt hype provable fun or good it just comes off as conspiracy theorist prone at best pb reminds me alot of uw probably shouldnt idolize fwiw uw i think spotted and shines a flashlight on one thing and did the leg work and literal tech work to make it relevant of a problem everybody knows about but doesnt deal with enjoy the bottom of this post make sure to hydrate oh every day i wake up to all kinds of interesting dd explained to me like i was an ape fabuliscous ikr its the greatest show on earth its the greatest story ever todl commenting to read later in the itoilet the best thinking spot wow keep in mind it is not just the us this is felt all over europe as well except maybe for a few nordic countries how is this gme related that last part about social security is proof that it is in fact a ponzi scheme you need workers to pay out one retiree where did all the money collected previously go surprise the government borrowed it and because of that current payers into the system are not saving for retirement they are paying for those already retired fun fact about social security when it was created the life expectancy was a little over it was implemented to be an in case you outlived expectations and ran out of money it was not meant to be a retirement account it was more of an insurance policy end the fed end central banking repeal the revenue act of trying to survive long enough for end stage capitalism to strangle itself to death on the greed of the worst of humanity the only way to save ourselves is to save each other great post i wish people like powell and yellen would read this this is a really honest breakdown of real life economics and the repercussions of rigging the game for the rich it should be required reading for any of em before they take power is it only my blood that is boiling after reading this and knowing today will be another day where fraud will go on in the markets and nobody will be handcuffed and forced to close their illegal shorts we can no longer afford the super rich eattherich mafia this is a sexy read incredible work pb and welp i will take credit for the well that shit was bleak i dont understand how you take of someone elses dd thats emotionally triggering and then add even more triggering content on to it but when you think about it whats the fix to all this whats a better system than this passive system its the active and ethical free market system without monopolies good read i would claim these issues are in every industrial country stagnat wages ever more increasing housing asset prices mental drug issues and the consequences of these i as millenial dont believe that retirement system in my country will still exist when i get to retire so do many other yet most people arent wealthy enough to sponsor their retirement by only themself retirement system here is like a ponzi it works as long there is enough of new money coming in but what happens if there isnt hodling for justice fuck the crooks you cant blame the fed for all of it the fuckers running the world which admittedly the fed is part of have been systematically poisoning us with gmos medications and vaccines with only god knows what in them and various other chemicals and delivery systems the fed is a huge part of the problem but the wef and pharmaceutical industry is a better place to dig on some of this stuff imo of course excellent post thank you for writing all of this this is one of those things that we collectively intuitively know but often have trouble at least myself putting into coherence need help is it possible to crosspost this in other subreddits or will this be seen as a rule break by mods sure other people outside of superstonk here on reddit would love to read this lol finally gme guys are waking up too just a few years late but better now than never now educate yourself further and then you will understand why they tried to divert you from precious metals with their paper silver stunt their house of cards is built on sand and its so fragile that they cant risk people getting aware since there is only so much physical available once the physical is gone their whole rigged game of manipulation is over for comparison elon musk alone could break the system because there is so few silver available new cpi calculation will shine a better light imo they will all be deleted usa land of financial criminals weirdest thing there was a housing bubble crash in the s leading up to americas only years being debt free i think this is a re run and all the central banks attempting to push cbdcs this is a great write up as a social worker i can attest to many family and men shelters being at capacity i havent seen a decrease in birth rate i have seen a spike in mental health and drug and alcohol workers caseloads are becoming increasingly higher each day this one is definitely getting archived fuck the fed reserve we also have an obesity epidemic because people are being overworked and have no time to cook healthy food at home therefore theyre going to fast food restaurants and eating unhealthy food more often sewacyde should be suicide ah now the gop pro birth movement makes sense their atms stopped being born so they need people to bail them out how i so want to see these assholes burn how could you do this to your own people at least we are trying to do something to stop all of them and to think i just wanted a thousand dollars total from this play then they cranked up the money printer right along with the stock printer how is a government of the people allowing this you should build pride in your populace not strip them of it the only thing left to do we cant talk about here you will own nothing and you will be happy the balls on that lizard i swear same i wanted to turn my shares into a each and buy a bigger fast forward years and now i have xxxx no fianc e around anymoar and am on a world quest to end corruption and thats exactly wut im going to do i wish every person on the planet receives this message this is a great post ive seen other studies that back up a lot of whats being said here but this is comprehensive it paints a terrible picture but i do appreciate your post if you think this is bad wait until after moass has made itself known and the dirty deeds of the bare people may end up leaving the country in waves i fkn love you op which one im only responsible for the was actually lookin at postin ur new article next well done welp you just keep bringing it cant stop wont stop why didnt peruvian bull just post this themself they havent been banned have they apes are empowered because of gme drs we see the rigged system and found a way to fight back and self advocate too many people feel stuck without good options the iron bank for our got fans out there tldr can you elaborate on how the fed owning mbs causes inflation in the housing market i can see a connection but i cant quite connect the dots went to my bank to take money out slowly transferring to credit union and the teller asked do you want to take it all out thought it was odd but i think people are starting to see whats going on and panic op i agree with everything youre saying here ive known about all of this for years because im a conspiracy theorist and have been visiting conspiracy theory boards for like the past years but if you show this information to anyone normal and try to connect the dots they will dismiss you as insane its infuriating when most people reach a point in life where they have a decent job have a house have a spouse and kids have a car and a retirement plan and a future they wrap themselves in a safe blanket of delusion they stop looking at all the things wrong with society and try to separate themselves from the bad they convince themselves that they are normal what they have is normal and anyone else who isnt like them is abnormal and they work hard to build up a wall between them and everything they consider abnormal the american dream might have been normal in the past but its increasingly becoming out of reach and i dont think that today it is even commonplace i think the majority of our population is suffering and falls short of the dream to at least some extent and thats not right i noticed a similar thread about mass immigration and birth rates today on a game forum steam off topic and going into that place you can safely assume some things about the posters one they live in a house with electricity and internet access and two they can afford a gaming computer the vast majority of responses were negative and dismissive in nature i posted in the thread and was asked if i had taken my meds population decline and population replacement is an existential issue for our civiliation but the normies refuse to consider the problem the issue is abnormal to them so they need to move it into a different space and build a wall around it its infuriating and what infuriates me even more is that we are heading towards a huge collapse and the normies will finally address the problem only when society breaks down to the point where they cant live their normal lives anymore only then will they acknowledge the problem and talk about how it was unavoidable and no one saw it coming i think in order to get clean data we need to separate homeless illegal immigration out of these stats individuals in shelters due to the fact that they recently arrived with nothing could be directly tied to increases in immigration if were trying to gauge the economic situation based on americans wealth these individuals dont factor in until they get their feet on the ground get legalized and get jobs and housing which many will do the proper cycle of capitalism is a closed loop where wealth is not hoarded and keeps cycling through the system but now its become an oligarchy where most of the money and value is being hoarded by a very small group of people but they dont realize that their wealth only has value because of the below them and if they dont have any wealth then the value of the s assets also falls were seeing this happen slowly but surely in real time right now as companies keep reporting massive losses in earnings despite all the money thats being pumped into the system and how strong the consumer is but in a desperate means to keep the money for themselves the executives are deciding to fire their workers who are also their customers and consumers meaning theyll have even less cash to spend on them in the future and theyll have even more losses theres absolutely no way this system is sustainable and is bound to crash eventually conjecture about monitary policy is intended to sow distrust in american markets and foment anti american sentiments this is not relevant to gme this is propaganda this is why its important for apes to be strong together we dont invest together but we sure as hell got each others backs i e weekly ape help ape thread and we gonna have to double that effort when the markets hit the iceberg this looks at the fed unfairly can it be done better absolutely but the same qe programs you are critiquing were used in full force eg exercising of fed charter to save america and the whole world global economy during the recession of the pandemic in fact it took a whole months worth of qe in a single day to make a dent into the markets thats how panic struck investors were now im not saying i agree with what the fed does but out of all the institutions in america it actually has processes to maintain its credibility thus integrity by following highly risk aware models as its role of lender of last resort requires of it let me ask you this what would you replace the fed with it handles a ridiculous level of responsibility within a system that childishly hates accountability maybe one day when web becomes web web well have technology to replace central banking and central market making to truly stabilize the economy for all but we are so far from that for now orchestrated collapse you vill eat ze bugz for the last few decades houselessness has been on the rise in virtually every major american city drug addiction and mental health issues are of course the driving factors you lost me there bro thoughts on this data about arab support for recognition of israel its from saudis mostly against it but if the country does end up recognizing no one will care tbh walgeria i worked in algeria and one time and we had some configuration issue on the network and the only place with the same hardware and solution was israel we had to ask for a workaround but sending emails to israel was forbidden so we had to ask colleagues in south africa to call and get the details uae not there cause its and they are already best friend allies smh in reality its not emiratis oppose the ibrahimic deal the zionists but they cant say it in public because jail will be waiting for them that based on a friend of mine who knows lots of them its confirmed algeria and libya are more based than palestine mauritania am i joke to you common algeria w yall better than us from the arab opinion index this particular graph is on page phoenicianlebanese the highest rate of refusal to recognize israel was among respondents in algeria and mauritania at each followed by those in libya at palestine at jordan at iraq and tunisia at its okay we are still in the game i blame kurds for the regardless if they were surveyed or not i love my country oof mauritanians and algerians and libyans are mega super based not surprised by morocco tbh th the country is moroccan theres a lot of cultural overlap egypt still wrong i have never known an egyptian who doesnt absolutely hate israel and its even more in the younger populations the poll was probably conducted in tourist places saudis voting for something for the very first time based algeria those who dont know actually support but they are pussies to announce it i can only speak for saudi youths here which is most of the population of us are under the age of i dont think the majority genuinely supports israel or see them as allies and while there is a great amount of apathy hatred for some palestinians due to perceived ungratefulness the vast vast majority would be against any sort of normalisation remember even for those who dont really give a shit about palestinians jerusalem is still an issue and no one likes seeing their third holiest site desecrated year over year the only reason you may hear about normalisation now is due to tensions with the us if we didnt normalise during the height of our relationship in the trump era you think well normalise now that were getting comfy with china easing up with iran you think well normalise now that were getting comfy with china easing up with iran saudi can never ease up with iran if iran is nuclear and saudi isnt this is true and what i saw saudis say online only morocco wanting that tit for tat on their very own illegal occupation dont you have your own maori colonisation disputes to attend to i thought a lot more supported israel tbh glad to see some brotherhood even though this probably isnt too accurate free palestine what is israel there is no israel say it a couple more times just to make sure you manifest it xd that country that has muslims and christians in a camp and millions of other muslims and christians just waiting for their homes to be stolen by illegal invading squatters that country kuwaity brothers voted with isreal will literally sell you for a pack of cigarettes prob some expats i doubt this study is even half credible methodology seems solid you should check it out https www dohainstitute org en lists acrps pdfdocumentlibrary the arab opinion index in brief pdf the reason why half of the saudis surveyed choose i dont know is cuz they fear that both a yes or a no could get them in trouble which is an extreme level of paranoia yes the government care what people say and not say but not to this ridiculous level the of morocco will certainly get higher after israeli recognition of moroccos control over the sahara they already recognised it to the in qatar im going to find you its a little high for kuwait saudi arabia didnt suprise me dont know a lot of moroccan prostitutes out of agadier would love that we already see the israelis tourist in the hotels dont jordan morroco egypt and sudan have full diplomatic relations with israel anyway not yet for morocco the liaison office was just like the one we had before the second intifada of whats up with sudan did someone buy out of their population saudi sitting on the fence trying not to get snatched by mbs if one chart alone could explain why the middle east is a complete mess i know feelings are raw and that the implementation of isreal is highly controversial but for better or worse they are your neighbours for now and forever better to focus on building relations or else the region will never emerge from the mire its in its good then that they dont get to choose their leaders eh bro you guys had the choice to elect your leader and elected netanyahu so sometimes not choosing your leader isnt that bad at all to be honest id rather stand with israel than with hypocritical backstabbing bandits bro shut up we moroccans hate israel and you just named israel times by saying hypocritical backstabbing bandits typical moroccan l thoughts on marvels recognition of israel wtf is an arabian knight and this orientalism isnt subtle at all lol half the superheroes in existence are just completely based on their shitty pun names the fact they made arabian knight really isnt even surprising lol look up dust from the xmen lol her nemesis is journalistman arabian knight is a badass name ngl this guy should be like sinbad and alibaba on steroids the muslim superhero is a jacked guy with a sword badass literally me for real she looks like toothpaste marvel is western propaganda of course anything depicting western values as positive is western propaganda just as every bit of media depitcting islamic valies as positive is islamic propaganda sabra lmao marvels earliest and most impactful writers were jewish so it isnt a surprise that their sympathies lied with israel and relied on orientalist stereotypes people complain about marvel going too woke but in some cases it really is legitimate to change some of these stories sabra isnt always painted as a good person in the comics theres a panel with hulk where hulk is crying because a palestinian kid was killed by sabra during their fight arabian knight is also portrayed as a good guy in the comics c mics have always been propaganda i mean captain america exists xd they also made a cringe comic of and even dr mf doom is crying lol just dont take this shit seriously plus its old af there was a comic where she got a palestinian boy killed after hulk tried protecting him only for hulk to later verbally attack her and asking her why she would attack those who cant defend themselves it ends with she finally viewed the palestinian boy as a human or something like that this is some subtle anti arab racism which is messed up because marvel started as a civil rights metaphor where the hell is sabras sister shatila in all of this shes harsh to her enemies but sweet to her friends huh i wonder if shes ever attacked the arabian knight this makes me like arabian kngiht even more he is a chad muslim that does not cooperate with is raeli people and he knows that it is haram to form a relationship with a woman they team up later on israeli is not even a nationality btw they have jew ids it is a clever way to not even recognize israeli arabs there is no jew id the id doesnt mention if the person is a jew or anything else the id is blue its israeli if the id was different it means they were not israeli just like in every country only a citizen of the country can vote arab israelis are israelis so they can vote in israel you know that of israels population is arab right inspired by this comic the zionist scientists created gal gadot in a secret lab the warrior hero has to be a female to remind westerners that the israels opponents are woman hating savages the fuck is this lol youre a snowflake if you think this is propaganda they literally team up at the end are you trying to get marvel banned in the middle east i personally started boycotting marvel as soon as the news came out i would support its banning i once read an old american cartoon magazine for adults from the s not really a comic was a funny satiric comedy digest talking about women of the world the magazine seemed to glorify european women and men and their sexual life cringe and misogynistic af whilst also talking shit at chinese and indian men with ugly depiction of their cartoons suddenly the arab muslim part came and i was disgusted how they looked at us at the time they made it seem arabs are fat dark fat lipped sinister looking devils that lash their women with an ugly cartoon depiction they even talked how unattractive middle eastern women are i couldnt read it but knew the west was just as racist and misogynistic at the time is it her nationality or the fact that sabras a woman thats bothering you knight why no both i am harsh to my enemies yet sweet to my friends can you imagine any actor actually saying that line with a straight face this has the potential to be comedy gold arabian knight israeli female fighter merged into comics honestly thats a poor try by marvel didnt expect that im harsh to my enemies but sweet to my friends proceeds to bomb uss liberty theres a comic where sabra helped a village fundraise for the immune deficiency foundation just google sabra village idf to find out more this is why dc is better this is more funny than offensive it also makes it so much better that this character is forgotten by marvel they are trying so hard to cope lmao absolute cringe i swear to god man westerners have the most idiotic view of politics ever i love it when you guys dont let your opinion show in the title arabian knight is literally me the comic is very old lol free palestine that arabian knight looks like a turco mongol soldier that fights in timurid army lol marvel and their absolute shit of a franchise can do one also i cant help but think that adults who are into these things have developmental issues yes im an asshole but i reserve myself the right to pity people in their s who get hyped about superhero films especially since they dont see the propaganda in it yeah glad their entire companys going south you cant make any movie in the us featuring the military that isnt propaganda even nonsuperhero movies the dod and cia basically write and edit any movie scripts in order to allow studios to use american military equipment and save money bro wtf is this i looked everywhere for some fucks to give but sadly could not find any actually lol the jewish superhero can control peoples minds into thinking that what they own actually belongs to the superhero this comic is very old s marvel was started by jews dc too superman name kal el is hebrew it means voice of god when arab muslims invented t entertainment that is globally interesting you can tell your story too thos should inspire you hell even subsaharan africans are making chart topping acrobat songs globally your excuse is it her nationality or that she is a women mf look like toothpaste when is israel mentioned in a post title here hasbara trolls just spawn out of nowhere so many people commenting without reading you can tell its askmiddleeast from that alone lol as an israeli i do think there is some truth to that there is a sense of brotherhood imbued into israeli culture however it is my understanding and correct me if im wrong that arab culture is like that as well also why tf is arab knight just a racist caricature the cringe omg stan lee himself is jewish smash a lot to say about this mess but i dont know that recognition of israel is one of them she refers to an israeli people which there obviously is one thing that is very interesting is that the spiny pear she is talking about is a symbol of both the israelis and the palestinians i think making the arabian knight both antisemitic and misogynist or assumed to be one is a bigger problem for political representation i no longer recognize marvel i love marvel lol marvel try to make one good muslim character challenge and ofcourse the arabian knight had to be misogynistic who is arabian knight lol whats that wow thats why dc is better what were her powers decades old pulp fiction for children probably not the best venue to find a nuanced take on middle east politics i think the biggest problem is liberals who think they are entitled to speak on behalf of everyone muslims need a muslim voice christians need a christian voice and on and on someone call edward said asap i love how they just put the misogyny umbrella over the whole of the arabian peninsula like everyone who lives there hates women unsurprising its a multi billion dollar company they will die out with the colonial entity they support depends if shes a zionist or not jewess this is the dumbest shit ive seen in long while let alone the obvious propaganda they go again and plagiarize like they always do with everything shes gonna be in the mcu based theres a reason people remember neither heroes honestly this really racist both ways finally dont like it coming from an israeli arabian knights my best guess is holding a sword and wearing the clothes he wears the sketch is in the s what israelis are she speaking of israel established in the something fun fact marvel actually is older than the state of israel established in is this real aside from the looks and the strange characters why is ironman depicted as so dumb here the literal genius of mc isnt there a comic with a palestinian terrorist hero killing innocents israelis asking for a friend bruh im losing braincells looking at this arabian knight is better than whatever fuck that toothpaste bottle is also since i wanted to see if there is a hero from turkey i only got walther feyzioglu from earth blud is quite decent tho based cringe fuck this bullshit is his super power blowing himself up so iron man recognizing israel is the problem not that the arab hero is being antisemitic it s a drawing the titles ironic cause i thought itd be funni lol not just that but also the stupid attempt to tie his opposition to misogyny alongside children killer no titanium level cringe marvel has officially become the bad guy although in all fairness it was all made by a couple of jews so this shouldnt have been too shocking zionist apologists at marvel are really going to pretend that the torah isnt sexist af arabs need to stop seeking white validation they dont like you and its reflected in their popular media you want izza you want honour seek it from islam i dont mind the recognition of israel as much as the harmful representation of arabs short answer its the nationality stan lee was jewish solo yeah need more of this theres one with the hulk holding a dead palestinian child please guide me to these collectibles even if just online ok thanks truly an array of heroes i always thought funny that israelis took as symbol an invasive plant hasbarist rubbish has reached comics lol jews practically invented comic books as we know it you guys are so sensitive very woke of you to scrutinize everything u see about israel without any clear motivation or context thats the joke idiot bro its just a freaking comics thats the most absurd thing to be furious about man i wish these were my problems propaganda is dangerous especially through comics because you dont even realize youre consuming it nah just thought itd be funny to post israel of course they have to make us seem misogynistic try not to hate on israel challenge impossible for this subbredit you have the idf and some israelis to thank for that hallo all well youd be waiting a while for one if i rolled it lmao ill ne waiting caught a live nice

succeed once mark zuckerberg owner of facebook invited five people years ago to his harvard room reason talk to them about a business opportunity only two came to the meeting listened and helped their project today both are billionaires dustin moskovitz with more than billion dollars and eduardo saverin with more than billion dollars when a friend comes to talk about a business opportunity always have an open mind this is like talking to a lottery winner and concluding the lottery is a good way to get rich most new business investors lose their money someone like zuckerberg is an exception not the norm profile photo for pretty girl lets not forget he stole the idea from the twins who stole the idea from myspace this is a total bill gates theft that was performed on steve jobs steve jobs stole throm others like mouse interface on mac there is no good guys in this business only thiefs and liars and those who come on top are best liars and thieves simple as that youre right but the common success in starting a business is to dare it s not easy to dare daring and bravery dont guarantee anything in life we would like to think it does but at the end of the day no matter how hard you want to sell a product if nobody wants to buy it you dont have a successful business no the success like facebook is just an anamoly and not a norm of time you would end up wasting your money on some stupid business idea but at least youve tried something it better than being a regrettable spectator or aimless consumer at least ive tried something ive been offered business startup opportunities for an internet video game media comic book education companies all my life and when i was young i was dumb enough to be involved and do a lot of work for these so called companies only to have them flop and not get paid the worst one was a startup education software company making software for special needs children i spent a lot of time doing the base code and art design for the the software i gave them the demo to look over and they took it and run and i was paid nothing these startups were a complete waste of my time ive finally learned my lesson and ignore those dumb offers i dont dont look back at those so called opportunities and think at least i tried something i look back at them and think about what a young fool i was and how much of my time i had wasted you can say that for the nfl nba tv shows movies books stocks most companies go bankrupt in years so why try opening a restaurant knowing the odds should make you more fearless determined to do your homework know your competition and outwork them and out think them elon musk compa seriously you are giving elons example no these opportunities are really shite and you should not waste your time wow you guys are super negative the average business opportunity may not make you a billionaire but it could still be profitable whats the harm in listening even if you decide that the opportunity is not for you you may learn something but the returns on that th opportunity is much bigger i mean thats how angel investing also works times money gets written off but one scrub daddy earns you runway to do this shit for times youre not going to get invited to business opportunities though are you so its a waste of time if you only have a in chance of them being good propositions useless red circle i dont like mark but i have to admit that those are my favorite flip flops i have ever owned the addidas with the nubs on the bottoms are the best nah bro they hurt when you break them in i had to give them to my dad after a week i got the same adidas flips jack trotter when a friend comes to talk about a business opportunity always have an open mind except when its selling crack and pimping hoes on the street russell smith great margins though substantial regulatory risk peter sancroix open legs for the pimping open mind not really the option aldina fazou u are right i wish i would meet zuckerberger for some advice on the right way to be successful in a business to add to that some people have the idear but luck capital but some have the capital but lucks idea therefore they both need assistance immanuel okokon unless its all happening via an app called course correct anthony parry i have a great business idea it involves the titanic and wealthy tourists not many ideas actually work out well unfortunately bailey g make sure you use an xbox controller for steering instead of a logitech that was their first mistake lyndon sniper if you do so safely and dont cut corners in safety you can actually do it though youll probably have to charge like million per passanger and be allowed to only take like two people at a time many people dont realize that to build a submersable takes millions because of the materials you nee submerseble and passanger is crazy though cant trust someone who types this out either mate perhaps they dont and perhaps the only spoiled children but surely their millionaire father did hard work always more heavy to become first generation than the last tunnel man of course someone had to succeed to begin with some of it will be old money but much of the wealth around the world is borne of hard work or strong skillets or both usually mayuresh fulambrikar why does everyonehave a problem with nepotism it is an empire that someone created whether to burn it leave it to their descendants or to someone else is the decision of that oerson who are we to judge ian if nepotism was just a case of parent passing the company to a son daughter or other family member to do with as they will that would be their problem but its not often its government officials and civil servants giving jobs and positions to unqualified family members in order to secure their own position to ensure the board votes the way they want or to ensure their own embezzlement isnt discovered made public its this kind of nepotism that most people have a problem with however i for one am also pretty peeved with the self made million billionaires spouting on about how they became successful without truly acknowledging the massive step up they got from starting with all the money networking education etc handed to them on a plate c b if you got friends at harvard sure listen very true words as a young man i was also approached by a friend my age a woman i used to have fun with we were both non paid extras in a professional musical after five six months on the stage including a tour the play was to come to an end she asked me and another guy if we would like to sheldon j plankton my friend talk about bussines at im come and listen for hours nothing happen now patricia levis wow there are really good articles and interesting posts on your page i checked your posts and you always posted good writing can you follow me back on quora so i can always get notified in any of your posts and comments thanks s erra okay and he stole the whole idea of facebook did he not down to every last detail jeremy losek lets not forget zuckerbergs innate business sense to be born to well off family he was able to go to harvard and his father was able to give him a loan to start his business in reality if zuckerbergs family could only afford to send him to the local community college wed all still be richard amoako so how come myspace that was owned by a billionaire didnt survive if money was that important batman love the way how people shit on billionaires jim douglas i think id be able to put up with that if i was a billionaire it would be hard but i think id manage bailey g well i dont think theyre browsing quora and getting their feelings hurt over it so boys girls the life lesson that you need to learn from this is precisely this try to steal a really good idea from a couple of smart people without them knowing what youve done until you have time to launch it successfully as a marketable product that is as profitable as the creators had imagi tia never use these billionaires as examples no one will become like them you will be very disappointed and dont be hard on yourself when your idea will never match up focus on being more at peace in life ak wtf failures you talkin bout he got rich by stealing tyler and cameron winklevosss idea lance levier he heard their idea and realized they didnt have the vision of a worldwide social platform they just wanted to do a local harvard thing then they the winklevosss got millions and millions in cash and stock its not like the winklevosss came up with the idea for a social network social netwo klmj great last year a friend asked me if i wanted to join him in his new taco joint which seeks to revolutionize the way we eat tacos ill call him again just in case steve swann i know someone who invited people dozens of times to talk about business opportunities but nobody had much luck just frustrated efforts and a waste of time but that was amway julfazzlee have to make sure theyre from harvard or one of the top unis leoben dsfrendz no there are thousands of billionaires from india china russia europe middle east asia etc and theyare have involvement in oir technology padraig cuinn he stole facebook so yes he is a loser joonu thomas apropos the last line when a friend comes to talk about a business opportunity always have an open mind unfortunately a lot of business opportunities that friends talk about are mlms and ponzi schemes perhaps only in a million is a mark zuckerberg talking about facebook fokwa divine i was about to say that finna sprang how wealthy did the other three harvard bratts become in the real working mans world friends may reach out if theyre struggling some may network or barter a bit but friends and business really aint a good plan work is survival for us little people and i am done giving the harder you work joseph t fail several times until you rip off someone elses idea sure as if he was a genius a loser predator in the wings yet hes praised muti ur businesses opportunity of stealing university idea you cant force ppl some have their own business values and goals it is fine to be different and live the way you want without being millionaire it is also great if you are being one why do you want to be a millionaire if you are not happy they are happy then its good sounds like an overused anecdote for prospecting people into a ponzi scheme claudette perkins yes my thoughts i have been homeless and went through domestic violence but have yrs college and degrees and i am a senior in the criminal justice field a note it isnt how you fall it is how you get up and no matter what i always get up it about me and making it i have worked with homeless and s lubom r stejskal yeah people love to pass on opportunities and then complain about those who did not and managed to succeed because of that john doe we all know zuckerberg stole the facebook idea from fellow alumni jerry sam who stole the idea from myspace leoben dsfrendz so whats in it for you all tech millionaires and billionaires stole got ideas or learned from their peers or somewhere else study each brand whats impt is they made it bigtime billionaires innovators theres an abundance of people w bigger brains than they have why cant anybody do the same and amos totally agree man thomas schultz you are right in out of a million times but if you are right a in that one of a millionth time then that is enough david purr and then there is steve jobs doesnt really fit the mold as you will find many other great entrepreneurs and investors do not generalizations are easy to make but so often not true syed ali aatif he literally had sociopathic tendencies even his relationship with his own daughter was constrained leoben dsfrendz ive observed all great achievers innovators exceptional performers thinkers innocators etc have some sort of psycho trait disability we just have to cherrypick the good and discard the bad if nobody can explain it guess its just how it is sergio e he was a tyran not what a human being should be patrick holmes i see he still has the same stupid hairstyle alexander ismail his idea lets steal a local project from two nerds and use it to foster extreme right all over the world edward ryan i wouldnt necessarily recommend that opportunity to just anyone imagine making billionaires out of sociopaths and narcissists and then ushering them into positions of power and authority and then theyre invited to ted talks and who conferences and before you know it they are years old and leoben dsfrendz everybody wants to be like them exceptional achievers and their money but nobody wants to experience the psycho part theyve been through or are currently carrying though not fault of their own shiva shankaran whats the relation of your answer to the question noor fatima no doubt every business needs attention and loyal hard worker like him elvira ackerman yeah he also fucked saverin over and he won via a lawsuit against his best friend jerry sam how so if saverin is a billionaire ashwin kale here in india successful enterprises are familly businesses friends or anyone needs almost free workers jenny huff ive noticed that when a family is invested in a business they are more successful they keep the business in the family and each member contributes and works hard im talking about indian families in america where i live there are several family owned businesses that are managed entirely by the f ashwin kale exactly yousafzai btw who were the rest of guys nitesh kr there were other co founders as well such as andrew mccollum dustin moskovitz anr chris hughes and later on eduardo saverin left the facebook bob smith yeah right open door to lose all your stuff and more plus who wants to work with zuckerberg money is not everything in life richard amoako the thousands of facebook workers would disagree with you dragos leu correct vp not everyone can afford to work for free and thats the reality same with unpaid internships this then causes an unfair advantage for someone who doesnt come from a situation where their parents can fund their projects not showing up doesnt mean disinterest it means some have competing priori jenny huff so many of these unpaid internships take advantage of workers who are not in a position to work for free especially when these companies can afford to pay them they are told they will be paid in experience with a company that has a great name but could care less how that person is supposed to live arvind perumal how does this answer the question michael mustang so what about the sandals john boyland an open mind sure but not one so open that your brains fall out the vast majority of business ventures started by college students are not facebook theyre a waste of time and money that no one will even remember a year later just because someone wins the lottery every now and then does not mean bayuka well the problem is that my friend sometimes stab me in tne back not with a knife but a chainsaw sep maximilian this doesnt even answer the question g coble does this answer the question did zuck fail a few times richard mutumba do not forget that you need rich or well connected parents or both as well mr notifier why dont you talk about many businessman failed they also start bussines with so much effortness but you just tell the story about the person who everyone knew him so rich because it make you article always be right and seem to be convincing even the content may not meaning at all kresimir jelusic i talked to a bunch of friends to a bunch if opportunities spent k and none of it came back in years its less than chance of making it but were at it again john

checked your posts and you always posted good writing can you follow me back on quora so i can always get notified in any of your posts and comments thanks milton rodrigues maybe we miss the point here zuckerberg was prepared to share his deal with the other in fact i think it was eduardo saverin and those twins who actually rowed in the olympics for them this was bigger than winning the euro millions lotto paresh terse so whats the question jesus santos even if i knew i would not become a millionaire i would go to hear about new ideas by a harvard intelligent student anyway emre sever i am wondering what the three other guys are doing now big jay are we just still gonna pretend that zuckerberg didnt steal the facebook concept off those harvard grads krzysztof kunicki as real as other american dream stories pradeep nope my homies still believe they can make a large robot dild l gure becoming a billionaire is not for everyone their vision of the future is very different from ordinary mortals they are molded differently their passion is intense and deep thats the reason that with billions of people on earth only a handful of them exist voters should be free to elect their representatives we survived though barely i honestly dont understand why we are so neuralgic about the specific issue of age the issue is fitness not age many people are living longer healthier lives so of course the average age is going up lots of demanding professions have base line mental and physical fitness standards to make sure they can do the job if we were serious about this question we would have a battery of mental emotional and physical fitness tests that everyone running for national office including supreme court justices would receive at the time of their first candidacy and every years thereafter after age tests would come every year this would be a non partisan qualification to stay in the pool of those fit for office maybe we could screen out a few of the psychopaths and personality disorders before its too late so you want to empty the house of republicans who should decide for you which person should represent your interests as long as you are a well informed rational human being you should vote for your representative who should meet the same prerequisites one reason why congress is getting older is that life expectancy has risen from around in the s to over today years ago many of these old members of congress would not have survived into there s and s that being said as we age health issues grow we naturally slow down and cannot do demanding work as effectively therefore there is a time we need to step aside and retire for many members of congress it is hard to give up the power with the aid of their staff who do much of the work older members continue long after they have the stamina for the job sen dianne feinstein being pushed around in a wheelchair by here staff is a prime example why is the republicans distribution skewed lower do they not live as long someone would have to explain to me why age is an issue in regards to elected representatives voters elect representatives do voters know the ages of the people they vote for voters cannot vote for anyone below the age of lets say twelve because the community assumes twelve year olds cannot comprehend the interests and perform the representative duties required by the community should people over lets say seventy five not be allowed to run for representative office because they cannot performed the required duties of the office they are seeking if so maybe those over seventy five years of age should not be allowed to vote the point here is why isnt the focus on voters as opposed to elected representatives i can answer that because it is easier to address the effects of a problem rather than the cause of a problem just ask the pharmaceutical industry the dumbing down of american representative democracy is an endless journey from years ago https josephurban wordpress com is the new i think feinstein is too far gone to even make a rational decision about resigning term limits rs and ds need to cut a deal mitch and feinstein go home not quite an even deal kys dem governor has already laid the groundwork for filling such a vacancy with a dem the state legislature passed a law saying an appointed senator needs to be from the same party as the one who vacated the seat but theres a compelling case that the law is unconstitutional not only is there no provision or mention of political parties in the constitution but its authors explicitly warned against them i have voted for feinstein forever and now she needs to call it quits she needs to go home and take care of herself and allow the governor to temporarily replace her with a younger black female until the next election california will do what it can to deliver on increasing diversity in the congress no matter what the maga zombies want california is where woke goes to live the front runner for that spot is marginally younger than feinstein barbara lee is age is up iq is down thanks to the magats it is a dangerous thing for a nation to be guided and ruled by the experiences and prejudices not just racial of a hundred years ago especially given how much our world has been transformed in that hundred years and what a dangerous precipice we stand on in multiple ways people who cling to power with their last breath do so only for the sake of power and those with few years left to live care nothing for the future that long ago became unreal to them this is all possible because our so called democracy is petrifying into a puppet show for the oligarchy having said all of that statistics are tricky things on a simplistic level there are far more uo in congress today because far more people live to be it would be interesting to know how many office holders retired in past periods of history what is the average number of terms that they served how long were they out of office before they died that might give a better idea of how we compare to the past however it does not change the fact that a nation should not be led by its great great grandparents in the s and s young people were drawn to politics in order to make a difference what we the boomer generation has done to politics has given millennials and gen z the opposite urge i have to think the conservative majority on the supreme court gets a great deal of blame for that with citizens united that decision monetized politics more than any other event if any decision should be overturned that is the one because the gop has not brought up a fake case to get this overturned tells me that they feel that it benefits them the most follow the money start w heritage foundation dont be too worried about age age is not the problem vulgarity lack of decency and sense of propriety are the most repulsive members of the house for example are relatively young george santos is years old marjorie taylor is lauren boebert is matt gaetz is madison cawthorm was when he was elected while the tea partiers that gained notoriety during the administration of obama were also young ted cruz jim jordan jason chaffetz judge them according to the content of their character not according to their age those representatives are in a class by themselves when it comes to impropriety ted cruz abandoned their little family dog snowflake to die in the worst ice storm texas ever experienced for that alone he should be thrown out of congress two words term limits or as trump might say it one word term limits ballot access for independents would solve a lot of this easier than getting congress to police themselves whatever that means americas political representation has gotten really old people are individuals not ages races religions parties genders etc so you oppose the year old limit in the constitution as well and you dont think that there should be an age requirement for driving a motor vehicle voting etc some are ethical and duty driven others are in it just for the power congress a place where america comes to die the constitution has an age limit for eligibility to be elected president its logical that the constitution should be amended to have an upper age limit for serving as president in congress and on scotus in corporate america they have mandatory age limits a majority of firms in the s p and more than a third of s p firms have policies in place that mandate the retirement of their ceos at age including general electric altria exxonmobil and intel the federal government should emulate this practice with all the advances in modern medicine we can see where our scotus justices and our senators could be serving into their second century of life its logical that the constitution should be amended to have an upper age limit for serving as president in congress and on scotus disagree thought id dearly love to have more youthful potus that said i also believe that bidens age aka longevity is the reason he was able to beat trump he had a very long record of accomplishment including veep during his tenure he has gotten along well with republicans who began to savage him as soon as he took office see mcconnell graham on upper limit the candidates age was know when they won the election at that time we had a choice and selected elderly we cannot bemoan age when it was very much on display additionally not only did an aged trump win he had no experience and thus far a solid lock on maga republicans so much so that the others fear him his base is lusty with boos for everyone else they attacked the nations capitol all to push a lie just a reminder that old joe has done more in his three years of office than most modern era presidents omg get out retire ill take an year old pelosi over a something boebert and gaetz anyday they are also deciding laws on new technologies and have no idea how it works so are the founding fathers but according to originalists this is the way it was intended no women or children and blacks were of a person the constitution and the resulting laws were designed to be flexible enough to adapt to changes both technological and societal the gop through scotus has determined that the inherent flexibility is woke i believe that term limits not specific age is a better approach i confess that these are the politician who likely best represent me sigh maybe it isnt the age but the integrity good point if congress was substantially younger you could see a whole array of benefits being shut down for the elderly the spectral shift of congress serves the needs of the people better as for the integrity my personal experience is that the younger set believes that cheating and lying is acceptable to get ahead recent article about resumes in wapo confirmed that notion its not the age of congress but the age of likely voters that determines pointing benefits at older people someone over is far more likely to vote than someone under because the aged cant possibly be expected to understand laws on new technologies you are a bigot ageism is the last accepted form of bigotry in this country i would bet im older than both of you if you havent hit your th then i am correct i am a retired engineer that is not afraid of technology like so many of our congressman and women that have not taken the time to understand what they are voting for to watch them in real time in congressional hearing stumble over their own words because they dont understand technology makes me sick so saying that i am a bigot just shows your bias more than anything i would bet im older than both of you if you havent hit your th then i am correct i am a retired engineer that is not afraid of technology like so many of our congressman and women that have not taken the time to understand what they are voting for to watch them in real time in congressional hearing stumble over their own words because they dont understand technology makes me sick so saying that i am a bigot just shows your bias more than anything but the older generations still dominate congress im pretty well convinced wed be getting better more realistic responsive climate legislation if we had many fewer older representatives who wont have to live with or die because of escalating climate blinking red lights alarms older reps tend towards dismissal because of their time bubble resistant vested interests supporters recognizing their behavior practices have to change hard to convince anyone who owns multiple residences in various climates that obscures for them overall trend lines psst you stand a far better chance at climate regulation with an year old democrat like pelosis than you would with a year old republican like boebert gaetz stephanik etc bs most of us care deeply about our offspring and the future of the world you re listening to a few rich and selfish so and sos what i cannot understand is why the young folks stand around moaning about the elders running things instead of oh say voting themselves getting out to support parties that come close and turning them into somehting better running for office the selves don t you whine about boomers as long as you sit and crying instead of getting up and acting we re the ones who drove back the fascist forces years ago and we re still trying to hold those dikes alone we are living longer and having fewer children therefore the need for term limits increases or else well have the same people in office for decades the public and mcconnells constituents fewer e to know exactly what the neck happened hete not simply have it brushed off as im fine now its good they have access to that amazing government funded free healthcare et cetera no they pay for coverage just like other citizens although they do have a very generous retirement package perhaps more should use it hmm looks as if there are far more dems than republicans older than in congress it must therefore be a good and just and right thing because we walk the path of goodness and justice and righteousness in all our ways but if it were bad itd be the gops fault interesting report on an aging congress but its not surprising as life expectancy increases so does the average age of congress has congress aged more quickly than society as a whole id say yes and a bigger yes to some yorkshire puddings the current class of lawmakers is one of the oldest in history with an overall median age of the median age of senators is the highest on record in the house the median age has hovered between and for the past decade higher than in any year before that period gerry meet mandering the interesting thing is that there are actually more people under on the gop side of the house in the chart and more people under in the senate on the gop side unexpected this tells me that the democrats are not preparing the next generation for leadership my suggestion is that the senate vote to expel both diane and mitch simultaneously to keep things even steven al it takes is a vote but that will never happen because the same thing will or should happen to them as their brain cells slough off as much as i respect year olds being one of them there is no way a person that old should be president or in the senate there may be no dementia but forgetfulness and simple lack of energy cause bad decisions trump is in a class of his own he has spent a lifetime of doing the evil he does and it is so ingrained that he can spew it with energy in his sleep but dont ask him to think thoughtfully about anything so what the article lacks any attempt to offer insight or context on whether this a good thing or a bad thing and why we know that the leaders of our representative democracy are not representative on a variety of dimensions race gender income occupation among other things maybe this body was representative when both its members and the voters were limited to property owning white males the latter has changed the former has not and commentators in the post and elswhere wonder why people have lost confidence in this institution i did not realize the average age dipped so low in the s maybe that is why age limits were put on the back burner committee assignment and ego are keeping most of these folks here too long age limits term limits needed humm the dems look pretty flat in their age distribution the repubs look like they have killed off their elder statesmen whats with that the constitution sets minimum ages for elected offices so it is clearly constitutional for congress to set maximum limits say doing so would also discourage the re election of representatives and senators only because they accumulated seniority in the house or senate and can therefore control key committees given longer productive lifespans an increase in workforce age is generally expected wisdom not age is the essential criteria for knowing what to do when and how those concerned about not having enough youthful input need look no further than the congressional staffers who are considerably younger and able to provide a youthful perspective to decisions when voters choose competence and wisdom over politicians pushing phony issues we will get the representation and leadership the country needs until then our congress will reflect our own poor choices that hurt us all sudden freeze up he had an ffffffing stroke orwellian at wapo do you expect wapo to call it a stroke when no medical determination has been made public he looked like he was possibly having an absence seizure which wouldnt be surprising after his fall and concussion several months ago i had them when young usually they were accompanied by music generated by my brain had one during a piano recital didnt miss a lick on the piano even though i blanked for several minutes dang that brought back a memory i had a similar experience during my piano recital only i un blanked during the piece didnt know where i was and just got up and walked off was it really a concussion several months ago or another tia feinstein mcconnell and other congress members in their age group should retire they simply cling to power for powers sake and offer no benefits to the country in fact they harm the country its high time to institute age and term limits in congress mandatory retirement age will weed out the doddering power sucking greedy malingerers and term limits might help minimize the damage caused by blustering idiots if you are concerned about the direction our country is heading as a result of know nothings i e the modern republican party then you should contact your local democratic party and do your part however small it may be to ensure that this mentally and morally challenged party is thrown out of office in i live in latvia which has a member unicameral parliament our most recent election was last october the youngest elected mp was while the oldest was the average age is years old there are only a few political parties in this country which have been successful for more than one or two election cycles in last octobers election only three of the seven parties that were represented in the previous session won sufficient support to win seats in the new session this means lots and lots or turnover it is also true that parties in latvia are elected on the basis of candidate lists and not individual candidates in america you have first past the post in the house and the senate and for all practical purposes only two parties that means that a single senator or house member can indeed hang on longer than might seem advisable i think our system here in latvia is better at least one the basis of this one very specific issue important things can still get done with a high rate of turnover just curious thats been an argument here against term limits in both houses like terms in the senate in the house which would each be years of course not much gets done here you wonder why a feinstein won her last election because no good democrats ran against her california has good democrats that could run but for some reason people are afraid to disturb the structure the average age of congress is rising theres no one to blame but the voters i blame the campaign finance system which forces unwanted candidates down voters throats i still blame voters i am boomer why are we and silents and greatest making laws and judging issues we a no little about and b wont be around to be affected we had our chances we blew it climate change anyone step aside or are you so addicted to power and perks you just cant let go congress is a country club once youre in you never want to leave career politicians are the problem this is all they know their egos wont let them retire we also have more millionaires in government than ever before we need limits on all of it they wont limit themselves once elected their hand is in the cookie jar they arent giving it up until they are taken out on a stretcher i am getting a bit weary of articles complaining about old people not caring about younger people old people being senile wealthy people not caring about the poor people who were brought up in a racist society being racist and so on the characteristic of age or wealth or lack thereof does not define who you are what you are capable of doing or what you think joe biden has a wealth of experience in his work and has used it for our country to the good would you rather have desantis for example because he is younger there is more than about age the incidents have involved health if you are an iron man athlete thats one thing but clearly were not talking about that not just age limits but term limits are needed specially for scotus we need younger folks who are living and will continue to live through these existential threats eg global warming to humanity wheres the chart depicting efficiency if she were dianne smith instead of dianne feinstein she would be propped up by the fish tank or the weather channel in the memory care unit while her accounts and assets are seized to pay for her care once these people get a little bit of power its hard for them to give it up best reason for term limits vote thats what term limits are a lot of these old geezers are still in there because people vote for them and theres something to be said especially if youre a senator the longer you stay in the more influence you gain and the more things you can do for your state voting only goes so far why because its hard to get candidates because of the money involved there is so much money in politics right now in the average campaign cost last year million the average person doesnt have enough money to get very far you must already have a lot of money especially if you are the opposite party d in red state r in blue state never mind that the name recognition claims the major party money raised citizens united lack of term limits and long campaigns have ruined politics for the younger generations its hard to pay for your kids mortgage and find time to fundraise millions of dollars we get the government we deserve we get the government that is forced on us thanks to citizens united im and is too old to be in congress the us looks feeble on the world stage biden cant read a teleprompter are we expected to believe hes running the country trump is the stable genius who decried the use of prompters until his staff pressed him to use them to mitigate his word salad rants during events by essentially every parameter the country is doing much better under biden than it did under trump and as far as running the country is concerned trumps only plank in his platform for is vengeance there was a similar article about this in the atlantic a while back running for a national office does require making connections having some experience under your belt and being fairly well off its especially true in the senate where i believe everyone with a couple of exceptions are multi millionaires and to be honest some of these younger members are completely unqualified except theyre telegenic and have a twitter feed or say stupid things and get a following examples aoc mtg anna paulina luna bobert etc imho comparing aoc to the crazy mtg and luna is ludicrous wearing an eat the rich dress and cavorting with rich people while pretending to represent all the brown people in her district is pretty stupid some of the younger people may be unqualified but so are the older people need we be reminded of the ridiculous questions asked when social media and internet bills came before congress at least aoc and mtg know what dial up versus fiber internet connections are yes age is important but perspective and philosophy are of greater importance are they impacted by your life experiences and the age in which you came of age sure but in our current situation what is critical is which of two paths you as a pol pledge to take forward or backward there is no doubt which of these two paths the dominant philosophy of the two major parties are committed to hard evidence is the legislative cluster muck now on display in the house of representatives and in numerous state legislatures across the nation the choice among all voters regardless of age is very simple forward or actually believing you can turn back the clock and recapture some mythical time when we were a white christian nation ruled by an economic elite who was deeply committed to ideas which consigned more than half of us to second and third class citizenship the progressive agenda is not perfect but it at least addresses the issues of the day and the future my old party the gop has regressed from being conservative to repressive in order to retain what power it gained and worst of all it now embraces principles of exclusion its once highly touted big tent has closed to women non whites the poor and yes anyone who might not identify as straight as if ones sexuality is a choice instead of yes how god did make you talk about a contradiction to actually embrace a version of christianity predicated on hatred and exclusion rather than love i now vote almost solidly democrat not because i believe in everything some in that party push but because the option from the other side has become bereft of logic common sense and yes principle it is my hope millions of younger americans i am to join me this election cycle to send a message to what is left of the republican party it is time to start looking forward and not backward brilliantly written it is a foolish notion that the elderly in our govt will be replaced by the young old people are always replace by new old people old people are not going anywhere there is a pathetic sickness to those that can afford to comfortably retire and dont personally i think they are very empty people and their job is their method to side step human consciousness the mother of all horrors biden should set an example and resign due to his advanced age and growing dementia point taken this article would have been much more worth reading if it contained anything but the raw numbers im not a big fan of age limits but i think a term limit of or terms in the senate would be appropriate after that long senators shouldnt be reelected no matter how old they are because theyll be too firmly ensconced regardless of their mental state in the current senate a year limit would mean that grassley and mcconnell couldnt have been reelected a year limit would have eliminated feinstein and patty murray maybe we could have a rule where senatorial candidates above a certain age have to have a running mate who will take over if the senator is incapacitated so that the voters know whos waiting in the wings the problem is that the people already in congress consciously or not enact laws that favor their own generation this makes it increasingly difficult for the subsequent younger generations to build wealth and have or raise the type of money required to run for congress someone recently tweeted for an american aged there are only two types of work available walmart greeter us elected politician i think age limits are well overdue and im already above them i think should be the age limit to run for office and should be the mandatory retirement age for all congress people all judges and for the president and vice president i get so frustrated every time a senior citizen government office holder rattles off some plan that i dont agree with so many congress people do not have any military experience and yet control the military e g sen tuberville our country is in need of age limits we have many in government that lack comprehension and are completely illiterate in most technologies please enough about trump if californians want to re elect yes i know she is not running senator df then they have that right one that should not be taken from them same for mitch sadly these older people in congress need to retire when one is no longer effective in your job it is time to move on same for judges and the supreme court we really need term limits for all these positions no as ny mayor ed koch once said the people have spoken and they must be punished the system has been corrupted by gerrymandering and money hopefully someday a third party will break through and upset the status quo congress is the nations senior center complete with a bickering bunch of old folks eating lunch in the cafeteria why would a young person want to spend time there edited the depends generation is taking over and holding on to their last day because they have non jobs just talking heads it takes a least a decade to make an effective politician ready for national office you start off on something like a school board where you learn how to read and implement government regulations you move in to town or city office where you learn how to deal with constituents and deliver service then you move on to state wide legislative office where you start to learn how to write laws and work with parties and voting blocks basically how to get laws pass you are not going to find college courses to teach you this there are no degrees and havent we all seen how bad it gets when people take short cuts around this apprenticeship ever time some puffed up person who believes years in business or as a celebrity decides that they can shirt cut around the training with their wealth the people end up paying for it so if you really want younger people in congress they have to start younger and not wait until they are in their s to run this isnt a conspiracy it is about learning how to do the job absolutely and why it is critical to vote in every local state and national election or you can say outrageous things develop a retinue of on line followers and run for congress term limits term limits term limits term limits the average lifespan in the us in for males was average age of house senate the average lifespan in the us in for males was average age of house senate i think the problem is exacerbated by party politics there is this entrenched anointing process see hillary and fear of weakening incumbents with challengers see biden and feinstein because these politicians refuse to let go to my knowledge the only politician ive seen hand the keys over to a successor is pelosi lbj i guess feinstein should not have run six years ago yes californians elected her but they had no choice did they id have voted for her too if she was the nominee when schumer is nominated again and runs against some loon gop candidate ill have no choice either biden and the dems should be succession planning the problem is theyre all logan roy none of them wants to give it up the distribution of house democrats is really interesting compared to the senate and house republicans it seems fairly even i notice a spike at and i wonder what that is the american people dont take their politics seriously enough these politicians conduct serious business for the people just voting for a name or a party or to make a statement is destroying the nation what would the senate be without bernie angus king is about and he looked very sharp on the committees his questioning was dead on susan collins is mediocre and always was i could do without her she thought trump learned from impeachment and she voted for kavanaugh despite a promise to protect rowe admittedly most of the better known octogenarians are still in full command of their capacities but term limits remain imperative as a remedy against career politicians over time developing walls of resistance against challenges of their abuses for personal gain and disregard of all voters interests ambivalent but what about the truly loved politicians who win by a landslide term limits deprive them of their choice i propose a compromise raise the percentage by which an incumbent must win surely bernie sanders can get of the vote the average age of congress is rising thats unlikely to change soon average human lifespans are rising as well and medical capability to extend and preserve life has never been better for thousands of years cultures before ours revered their older members respecting the value of their accumulated experience and wisdom the term elders has been used to describe leaders the world over as long as a person retains their mental faculties age is not a barrier to leadership it is in fact an advantage because an older person will have more experience to draw on to make judgements i do favor term limits for non elected government positions such as scotus justices but for elected positions let voters decide when a person is past their prime in the end its not about age but about results the odious moscow mitch mcconnell apparently doesnt have the mental faculties to be senate minority leader i fear he has mental lapses off camera that we never hear about chuck grassley and dianne feinstein also have questionable abilities i support age and term limits i believe many voters simply vote their party line without careful consideration of the individual candidate consequentially we have a geriatric congress people have the right to vote for whoever they want to represent them if they choose someone impaired by age by a mental defect or some other detriment they can do so and it is not the right of other people to tell them they cannot make that choice in we elected someone with a number of mental defects as the president of the united states that was an incredibly bad mistake that we are still having to pay for but it was the peoples choice under the rules by which we run our democracy people make mistakes smart people learn from them the problem is that the people already in congress consciously or not enact laws that favor their own generation this makes it increasingly difficult for the subsequent younger generations to build wealth and have or raise the type of money required to run for congress bernie sanders is one of the oldest members of congress at but his goals find great acceptance among both young and old im sure some in elected office favor their own generation more than others but that would tend to make them less electable over time age bias will be found out by voters and end up being a problem that voters solve themselves im not a big fan of age limits but i think a term limit of or terms in the senate would be appropriate after that long senators shouldnt be reelected no matter how old they are because theyll be too firmly ensconced regardless of their mental state in the current senate a year limit would mean that grassley and mcconnell couldnt have been reelected a year limit would have eliminated feinstein and patty murray elections are a natural way to exercise term limits voters decide when a person is too old to serve them well its not age that is the problem so much as it is the corruption addiction to money and power hatred of the poor and vulnerable and unwillingness to represent the majority who are pro choice and demand federal gun control legislation and that applies especially to many younger people in congress especially those on the right matt gaetz nancy mace lauren boebert for example there are a lot of older democrats in congress like pelosi who fight to save programs to protect the poor and vulnerable to expand access to health care support womens right to choose and regulate guns i would take nancy pelosi any day over the much more youthful mace or boebert so not congress being old but congress having too many republicans of any age yes no age limit there the average american is years old in the average age of a u s senator is almost twice that at age how can we expect people twice the age of average americans to pass laws that consider or benefit them its about whats best for the nation not a particular age group of the population or constituency some life experience as an adult is appropriate people in their late forties to mid sixties are probably best suited politicians are like pro athletes they hang on beyond their prime years because they cant give it up most of them dont know how to do anything else and have never had a real job to put food on the table with a paycheck the corrupt system in place makes politicians rich and athletes make far too much money same with hollywood actors they all use their resources to stay in control we can see decline of athletes and eventually they retire politicians stay far too long we desperately need term limits now we need younger people in power with fresh ideas for the current world nobody wants an year old president we have many talented people in their s and s with quality experience who should be in power comment of the day nancy pelosi reached her prime in her seventies when she played a key role in getting the affordable care act passed and she went on to accomplish a whole lot more right now two senators that you would see pushed out because of their age the year old elizabeth warren and the year old bernie sanders are pushing hard for a crackdown on insider trading dimple truth young people want nothing to do with politics not true the old establishment wont let go https www washingtonpost com politics ryan ohio senate vance democrats yes dimpled people make cute politicians maybe members of congress should be screened for dementia starting at age mtg is demented and shes nowhere near tfg is demented and will be at the end of a second term the problem is that we have strayed from the founders design which didnt involve antibiotics or chemotherapy or sterile surgeries for elected leaders we can solve our problem by returning to the founders original vision founders founders founders yeah sure lets idealize a bunch of rich white slave owners some more it is almost like we need to see a shrink this absolute need to worship these people the sooner we let go with that and change year old document the sooner we can fix our country i think you need to leave this country i just dont trust americans today to improve on the constitution if it is torn up and redone it could easily be worse actually minus some change and perhaps you should have read past the word founders i think you need to leave this country gee can you help me find a job in the eu easy to say you dont like it get the hell out in fact any year old bully in the elementary school can shoot his mouth like that term limits for potus for the house for senate years for judges age should have nothing to do with it limit the time in power no matter how old or how good the person might be a rolling stone gathers no moss so you shouldnt be allowed to continue even when youre doing a good job who defines good many think trump did a good job personally i would disagree wholeheartedly and years was years too long see i did mean to say years for judges not thats what happens when you dont proofread your comments i have been convinced for years that term limits on the order of terms in the house in the senate and longer term as president perhaps years combined with campaign finance reform would do more good for the nation than any other efforts fix the system before the symptoms if feinstein retired now newsom could appoint a democrat in that spot but republicans would not allow that new democrat to take feinsteins seat on committees they have to grab power wherever they can no matter how unethically when the senate sets up rules at the beginning they need to take into account the ages of their members and that there will be illnesses and such they need to change the rule that allows them to replace a member on a committee should it become necessary but we do need a younger government am older myself we need more fire and fight they should have kept her off that committee at the start of this congress these people all lack the will to do tough things it is their exclusive club and how dare you question a fellow member view from outside usa your leadership is too old hanging on like grim death to the power of politics and the judiciary usa is big country with many talented young people australian voters overwhelmingly voted to amend our constitution for high court judges to retire at aged unfortunately diminished cognitive decline means some officials do not know when their time s up and your country is poorer for it age with grace and let the young take over when its time you have to look at this from a distance our society is corrupt these guys from feinstein that kentucky guy or biden they all have a group of people who are so called assistants they also push the person to stay where he she is because it suites them these congress people as long as their front person is in d c they get to stay in d c with that salary with biden on top of all the dnc people it is one of his grand kids who likes to continue to live in the wh she and her husband both work for biden and live in the wh so yeah grand pa run for i like to continue to live in the wh everybody is out for number uno how can anyone in this country expect to retire if the leaders on congress cant even do it people often are wiser when older and if they are healthy and able to continue working then let them do what they can do getting good people to run for office is hard because they have to be able to raise millions to compete have to support themselves and family while running and must be able to land on their feet job wise and financially if they lose if that doesnt shrink the number of people wanting to hold office add to it the dirty underwear airing and the creating of fake or enhanced versions of said dirt designed to destroy the credibility and marketable persona of a candidate this isnt for a young person who works and has a family it is for someone backed by a very wealthy person or a very wealthy person older people may have made it inherited their own fortune and that gives them a bit of freedom to act and be political frankly many older people are quite competent and some younger ones may have more energy and fewer wrinkles but they are not capable of analyzing a situation crating good sellable policies and holding together their people just disregard policies pushed and contrast the effectiveness of former speaker of the house pelosi with current speaker of the house mccarthy who is much younger than pelosi pelosi wins taxation without representation no wonder most adults under the age of cannot afford to buy a house or have children these days no one at the federal level is there to vote for their interests vote for the right people instead of whining who said i dont vote age gives experience so again vote for the right people to represent your interests i dont suppose congress will pass upper age limits for office just as we have lower limits for office or voting age you could argue some people can serve capably in their s but then again some year olds might be informed voters turn the graph sideways and the house chart has a bell shaped curve to it yep we the baby boomers are still dominating and unlike corporations these leaders have fabulous benefits and staff who are willing elderly caretakers for great resumes our founding fathers and their peers had a life expectancy of maybe their s to them living well into the s didnt factor in but franklin jefferson and adams did live to be elderly so hence i guess they only saw a need for minimum ages maximum ages didnt seem needed were stuck with them all dont criticize feinstein and grassley blame stupid california and iowa and we should also blame the states and districts that elect people like trump green boebert cruz desantis abbott gaetz etc who or what do we actually blame for electing the biggest mistakes in history education television apathy ignorance stupidity all of the above nope hold the individuals accountable for their failure to represent their constituents they are of no use to themselves nor to anyone else and are both drains on american resources a big part of the problem is that so many current politicians justices etc have no life outside of politics thats why they run thats why they stay i have a tough time thinking of even one republican and many dems too who could hold a minute conversation if you didnt talk politics trump has a life outside of politics golfing all day everyday and he still stinks at it shuffling boxes filled with classified documents around mar a lago searching for lawyers for his many criminal charges and civil suits he has a life after politics thanks to his foresight while being president golfing btw is part of a life in politics it appears to be the sport of choice on capitol hill if youre in politics youre going to have an ego and wont want to retire voters love a familiar name and will keep voting for their representative until they die if people treated an election like a job interview instead of a chance to prove their party loyalty the u s would have better leadership either we let the voters decide or we change the constitution easy or hard that is whats wrong with our nation older folks want to go backwards not forward baby boomers were born between and the civil rights act was only signed in so they all grew up in a much more racist society we had the new left and i met several spanish civil war veterans the lincoln brigade they were in their s to s then the left of their era had been anti racist the article is missing a larger point that this isnt actually just in politics the average age of upper management is also ticking up all over you find the same thing in workplaces with boomers working past the retirement age and holding onto positions into their s no not just for more money its entirely representative of the boomer stranglehold on the population and the mindset of enjoying leadership positions as well as everything else so much that there isnt much care at all for the ones below them more ageism as if we were a club just because someone is older doesnt mean they dont have the capacity to deal with complex situations as demanded by their government position all representatives should have physical and psychological evaluations to insure they are able to deal with the demands of their office at ages the medical profession can determine physical and mental changes may occur the results of which should be made available to all other representatives or a select committee and if needed those in question need to be considered for replacement you are denying the following generations leadership positions and experience in those positions while ignoring what they clearly bring to the table compared to out of touch old folks that cant understand social media tik tok or ai its not just about if you can do it thats the entire boomer problem there is absolutely thought given to next generations and what they need to succeed entirely selfish and greedy in all aspects former british prime minister boris johnson wore a

politician lost some weight too pope hentai probably has it on his wallet too whats happened to johnsons moobs knowing him as we do itll have been paid for with money from his russian friends and will proclaim his love for russia all over the back of it he is a dangerous dishonest turncoat manipulative and fickle in equal measure never to be trusted and not to be listened to an industrial revolution without overt visible pollution alternatives to coal background fantasy setting highly rural pastoral social landscape is significantly more egalitarian but far from idyllic with no serfdom tying a peasant class to the land magic exists but wizards as a social class are estranged from others and have little interest or incentive to meddle in the affairs of mortals technological level is intended to be roughly analogous to the first industrial revolution and the setting is experiencing increased urbanisation and the rise of cities but question im in the early stages of working on a setting for a tabletop campaign and ive hit a bit of a snag as mentioned above id intended for the technology level to be that of the first industrial revolution but im having some difficulty envisaging how such a thing would succeed in this setting theres a number of political forces arrayed against them but i think the tipping point would be the popular outcry against the smog and smoke generated by factories powered by coal a second perhaps even more important concern is that on a meta level i feel having the city inundated with the kinds of pollution london saw would undermine the aesthetic im going for dark smokestacks belching out ominous black smoke should be reserved for evil wizards making their own little isengard so im at a bit of a loss ive considered moving the technology forward a bit to allow for electrical generators and grids which would get rid of the the visible pollution for the most part pushing the power plant away from population centers and handwaving away the in between steps but id feel id be stretching credulity if i also wanted to keep the vibe of mega cities being a new thing also on a very petty note id be losing steam trains and i do enjoy them am i overthinking this or is there an obvious solution im missing is there a way to maintain a bright clean aesthetic without handwaving things and hoping nobody looks too closely edit a couple of clarifications re social landscape and scale of city edit available feedback has helped me greatly narrow down my concerns and has been very helpful thank you all so if no pollution is a non starter is there an alternate power source that would provide a cleaner aesthetic but fulfill the role of coal in powering engines if you take a bright approach in your world and avoid putting the words pollution and ecology it might be just enough in other words dont talk about what you dont want to talk talk about the themes you wish to explore how much do you need to solve it an alternative power source is possible but a lot of coal burning was for actual heat for smelting kilning or glass making john its seeming very unlikely ill be able to avoid widespread pollution which fair enough its a hard ask and one that predates coal considering the feedback i should refine the question on how i can avoid overt visible pollution akin to how natural gas is colourless and odourless but still very much a pollutant is there another power source that could fill the role of coal without being as visibly polluting ill give the question another once over industry is not the issue the first factories were powered by water wheels not coal so you can make your cities a bit cleaner by sticking with this ancient rome for example ground enough grain for over million people using just water mills powered by the water brough in by thier aqueducts they also had water powered saw mills that they used for mass producing plywood and there is no telling how many other things they powered with the water they brought into thier city that said cities were already nasty polluted smoky places long before the industrial revolution the biggest problem is not the coal factories invented a few hundred years ago its all the wood burning stoves and fire places that have been around for millennia if your industrial era city is not a smoky nasty place then its not historically accurate unless your city has a methane pipe system unlike wood or other fossil fuels methane burns cleanly into just co and water with no ashes tars or other waste products so there is no visible or smellable smoke it is also colorless and odorless without modern additives to give it a smell so even if you have some leaking here and there the pollution will not be apparent either by baltimore installed the first piped methane powered street lamp system and by the s you start to see the first gas stoves being produced so this places piped natural gas replacing wood and coal burning well within the bounds of a late industrial era society the downside of methane is that until very recently it was only available as a byproduct of the coal industry meaning that many cities that burned methane in homes also burned coal in thier factories to remedy this it means you need to place your coal powered factories and such outside of town limits or sell the coal to those evil polluted cities and then pipe in the methane byproducts of your coal mining as a fuel for use inside of the city for cooking heating and light which will give you relatively clean air in the city itself these are all very valid points and thank you for bringing them up i had such a myopic focus on coal and smokestacks i completely forgot about the awful state of cities before coal ever took center stage i fear you are quite right in your assessment but ill leave the question open for a couple more hours to see if anyone wants to take a crack at an alternative power source before i mark this as answered once again thank you for your input grimm edited my answer after you accepted it turns out commercial scale methane production has been around for even longer than i realized making it not anachronistic for an industrial era society just not necessarily the norm indeed one of the things that powered the industrial revolution were the laboratories that depended on a good supply of quality raw ingredients coal coal gas oil methane many big cities quickly switched to coal gas or methane when it became available and while the coal gas plants themselves werent exactly clean theres a lot of stuff in coal they got better over time and it was still cleaner than most existing alternatives its just that the pollution was more concentrated city cleaner plant dirtier of course the supply increased demand dyes exploded with coal there may be a bit of misinformation here those dark satanic mills arose almost two centuries after the start of the industrial revolution industrialization began with waterwheels and hydropower was the power source which drove the rise of factories for a very long time london was not typical like at all the smog of london was mostly due to local climatic conditions and the universal use of bad coal for domestic purposes factories did play some part but they were not the dominant factor for example paris with different geographical conditions never came close to london with respect to smog and bad air feudalism is by far the most decentralized political system in human history i am at a loss to imagine anything more decentralized than the high middle ages electricity could have been discovered and used at any point in history at least from the classical age onwards it is a bit of a historical mystery how come we had to wait for the th century they had copper they had zinc they had iron they had acids they had wire there was no material element missing but what i really dont get is the part about cities being a new thing cities are a really really old thing cities came five thousand years before the industrial revolution basically cities exist to support trade thats what they are for without cities you cannot have the economic base where an industrial revolution can arise and about the pollution you may be overthinking it you just cannot avoid pollution in the city not with a pre st century technological base but you do not have to dwell on it to give a practical example one of the most pressing pollution problems which faced th century cities was horse manure london alone had about horses towards the end of the th century and each horse produced about kg of manure per day to say nothing about the smelly liquid waste and the swarms of flies thats tons of manure per day which had to be collected and carted out of the city on the other hand have you ever read a historical or fantasy story or seen a film where the horse waste problem was shown in its gross magnitude no it was carefully placed aside nobody wants to read a story or see a film about the problem of collecting and carting a thousand tons of manure per day janimiettinen for example how important was the king in a feudal kingdom was explained hands on to king john lackland of england at runnymede in for a visual example look at a map of the holy roman empire in the th century each of those countless colored patches is a state notionally subordinated to the emperor but in practice much more independent than a modern member state of the european union janimiettinen yes ok but those legislative and executive powers belonged to the local baron not to the state medieval states did not have any kind of central government in the modern understanding each and every feudal lord was chief justice and chief executive in his or hers lands quiz when did france acquire a uniform legal system nosajimiki in what way athens had a few hundred thousand inhabitants all obeying the same laws all subject to the same set of magistrates etc moreover athens was the central ruling power over a sizeable empire decentralized simply means without a strong center it does not mean democratic or anarchic with regards to electricity until the industrial era they didnt have wire at least not in the quantities and lengths needed to make an electric motor drawing wire by hand is a slow labor intensive process and most ancient wire was used for jewelry not tools you cant avoid pollution just consider that algae and photosynthetic organisms polluted earth so much with their waste gas to seclude anaerobic organisms into remote parts of the planet where oxygen cant easily reach and algae are far away from anything resembling an industrial revolution getting to something closer to our context early bronze age people heavily polluted their environment with the wastes of copper mining increasing the local concentrations of arsenic thanks to the wastes of smelting and again they were far from being an industrial revolution you simply cant produce a lot of something without having also a lot of something else in the form of wastes and polluting agents its the amount in itself that turns the waste into pollution indeed the industrial age became rather unprecedented in how much of the waste was further processed into something useful that might sound weird thinking about modern waste on purpose like plastic packaging fast fashion stupid cars and disposable everything but a lot of the industrial revolution was built on extracting every possible thing out of the resources you had coal was no longer just burned it was separated into coke metallurgy and coal gas lighting heating used to produce dyes and fertilizers sulphuric acid things got progressively cleaner sure horses could be considered more natural but tractors were cleaner though they brought pollution of a different kind and only got cleaner as time went on cars were seen as a wonderful thing that finally eliminates the dirty horses out of big cities and bring much cleaner environment which was true up until the point where the scale exploded beyond anything horses could ever provide and scale is the main thing that ultimately made the industrial revolution dirty a huge increase in population and density in stuff produced and unprecedented scale of warfare if you want a different outcome you need different motivations if you assume a capitalism first approach you should expect similar outcomes to our history you dont have to assume that capitalists are evil its just that they will be more focused on profits and the downsides of pollution will not be changes behavior until it becomes obvious that the downsides are significant widespread and detrimental if on the other hand the people have widespread honest respect for the environment and this is truly considered as a first principle then even those few that dont respect the environment will still take into account environmental impact because the consequences of becoming known as a polluter will be too harsh to ignore even then if some people think they can get away with it they will pollute as a shortcut cheap solution to waste disposal however the widespread pollution of london or rivers that catch fire should be rare due to a few bad actors the short term economic benefits of simple dumping waste to land water or air must be over powered by the bad karma of doing so thus the compulsion to be clean must be strong many people believe that the culture of the native americans was such that they were in balance with nature though certainly not true in a universal sense such a culture would be a plausible basis for such an outcome the widespread pollution of london had little to do with industry in the first place though which was why people didnt see the factories as such a big deal at first when people burn coal and unrefined coal at that in their fireplaces and with the massive amounts of horses everywhere factories that bring jobs and prosperity arent such a big deal the pollution from coal powered factories started being significant as london switched over to coal gas for lighting and heat which were much cleaner other cities tended to avoid coal but wood burning is still pretty awful incidentally rivers that catch fire were caused by those coal gas plants which provided the much cleaner environment they just had a few snags along the way heck one of the things that eliminated huge amounts of waste as weird as it may sound today was the spread of internal combustion engines finally instead of dumping all the waste oil products oil was used exclusively for the production of kerosene for lighting a rather small fraction of the raw material they could be used productively at least and fewer horses if people cared about the waste they wouldnt get there and as for the popular myths about native americans it would be better if they had any basis in truth at all d its even thought that the massive die off of the native population in europe too of course was one of the causes of the little ice age as people stopped burning so much wood and much land returned to wilderness sequestering humongous amounts of carbon dioxide theres no evidence pointing to native americans being any different from europeans in that regard most of the popular culture is either long past european colonization or outright invented out of thin air i suggest that you postulate different sources of fuel for example if there was a unique species of ballon tree that grows over coal deposits or swamps and extracts methane chemically from the coal or decay via the root system this would form havestable sources of methane for your world as another example your world could be rich in magnetite for some reason and the prevalence of magnetic sources led to the discovery of electricity as a power source before coal turbines could be water wind or animal driven if there was some cautionary tale in the recent history of your world which led to a civilization wide adoption of environmental responsibility lest that tragedy repeat could also help reduce the impact of industrialization several other answers have briefly mentioned methane perhaps your worlds industrial revolution is centered around farming and breeding microorganisms that turn farm waste or other organic materials into methane fuel this would also clean up the natural smoke and dirt of a city that burns wood or charcoal for its fuel smoke from indoor fires is a significant cause of health issues in pre industrial or partly industrialized urbanized societies even if the fuel is wood or dung this science article for kids has a good overview of biological anaerobic decay microorganisms cattle farts and non biological mostly volcanoes sources of the methane in our environment though you could make your planet be a bit different https kids frontiersin org articles frym this rather technical article discusses some of the ways that methanogenic archaea can be and are being used to generate methane which is burned for electricity and or purified and compressed into transportation fuel https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc the biggest issue here is how to trigger initial uptake of these technologies we learned to burn coal to smelt iron because there were places in the world where small coal and iron deposits were close to or at the surface and easy to access only once the technology was proven at that level did we start mining more inaccessible deposits at the scale needed to drive a full scale technological society one possible scenario would be clay deposits in bogs where people learned to use the methane from the peat bogs to fire clay objects on the spot this article talks about how some bogs have a clay layer underneath them and others do not though it is mostly focused on using bogs to grow cranberries https www cranberries org exploringcranberries into beneath back html hopefully this gives you some ideas to start from tl dr venice iceland for the win other answers have mentioned the two main sources of pollution in a london like city at the start of the industrial revolution coal wood burnt to in houses and horse manure iceland cleaner energy source burning coal or wood happens for two reasons heating and cooking you can mostly eliminate heating needs by relocating to a hotter area year long and the little coal or wood used for cooking should not be much of an issue provided theres enough wind to disperse it if you do not wish to go for a more tropical climate however another solution is a land with plenty of hot water underground that you can tap into by redirected this hot water into houses you solve the heating issue there are villages in france where houses have used floor heating for a very long time by piping naturally hot water into the floors it really cuts on the heating bill if the water is hot enough as in scalding hot or above c it will be free of any bacteria and may thus be used as is for cooking given that romans were building aqueducts and sewers in the antiquity an early industrial revolution society clear has all the technical know how to pipe hot water from the ground and should hot water not be universally available it would explain why the city sprang up here and not anywhere else its a prime spot to survive cold harsh winters venice cleaner transportation you can eliminate a lot of horse manure issues by switching from land based to canal based transportation a horse or other is nigh required to pull a cart because the cart is so heavy however the same load can be transported by boat fairly easily especially in the absence of current a city ala venice or amsterdam or copenhagen with an array of canals criss crossing it would be more likely to rely on boat transportation than horse drawn transportation at least within city limits combination combining the two will require a specific geographic location thermal hot spots are most likely found in mountainous areas so the city would likely be in the mountains though it may be close to the bottom on the nearby plain canals require a plain and likely a slightly spongy one marshlands close to a source of water be it river or sea a city combining thermal hot spots and canals would thus likely be located close to either river or sea in a flat marshland area with hot water being piped from nearby mountains elon musk i love

one the boy who lived mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like that when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours drive it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying the potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloaks he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door sorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for you know who has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imagination as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes shoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife mrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin most mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the potters mrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have you as he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today so snapped mrs dursley well i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd mrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt he i suppose so said mrs dursley stiffly whats his name again howard isnt it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agree he didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed while mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still there it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something was he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear it the dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect them how very wrong he was mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and high heeled buckled boots his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledore albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the put outer until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beady eyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know it was me she asked my dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly youd be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatiently youd think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much sense you cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknow who seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if you know who has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you know who nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know who i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name i know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one you know oh all right voldemort was frightened of you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never have only because youre too well noble to use them its lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer what theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavily professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not all theyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gone dumbledore nodded glumly its its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watch it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all places ive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left now you dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four dumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets harry potter come and live here its the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it hagrids bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sir no problems were there no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning is that where whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever couldnt you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house could i could i say good bye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the muggles s s sorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i c c cant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out well said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrations yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply dumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four good luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who lived chapter two the vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day up get up now harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream before his aunt was back outside the door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through the door nothing nothing dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fast perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it in the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questions dont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his face fell thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last year darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys direction dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested dont be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slug what about whats her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computer aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled i wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listening i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that cars new hes not sitting in it alone dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him i dont want him t t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms just then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmas im not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happen once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punished on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump but today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbage smelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcycles roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered i know they dont said harry it was only a dream but he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond harry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last after lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrys it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked too the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food hed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang chapter three the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry hunting this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funny they stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed said one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later life as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grown up harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water whats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question your new school uniform she said harry looked in the bowl again oh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wet dota be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emerald green ink there was no stamp turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard marges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon thats mine said harry trying to snatch it back whod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge p p petunia he gasped dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noise vernon oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick i want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said harry furiously as its mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope harry didnt move i want my letter he shouted let me see it demanded dudley out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the house watching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly but what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen no he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anything but im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboard wheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to me no one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful er yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroom why said harry dont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the month old video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys first ever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touched from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get out harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his hand go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a plan the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap harry could see three letters addressed in green ink i want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give up im not sure thatll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises on saturday things began to get out of hand twenty four letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor who on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag they drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this they didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room wouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage daddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared it started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveled its monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socks still you werent eleven every day uncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought found the perfect place he said come on everyone out it was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the broken down house the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two rooms uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully he was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all as night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now five minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did four minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow three minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come in chapter four the keeper of the keys boom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidly there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them whos there he shouted i warn you im armed there was a pause then smash the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor a giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them all couldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journey he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said the stranger dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an heres harry said the giant harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise i demand that you leave at once sit he said you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on anyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled true i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole arm what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly yet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand call me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry hagrid looked shocked sorry harry said quickly sony barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows it s them as should be sorry i knew yeh werent gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all all what asked harry all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut the dursleys were cowering against the wall do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy this boy knows nothin abou about anything harry thought this was going a bit far he had been to school after all and his marks werent bad i know some things he said i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your world my world yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode dursley he boomed uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry but yeh must know about yet mom and dad he said i mean theyre famous youre famous what my my mom and dad werent famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare yeh don know what yeh are he said finally uncle vernon suddenly found his voice stop he commanded stop right there sit i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage you never told him never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him i was there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an youve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror ah go boil yet heads both of yeh said hagrid harry yet a wizard there was silence inside the hut only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard a what gasped harry a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin goodun id say once yehve been trained up a bit with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be an i reckon its abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hut on the rock the sea he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sorc chf warlock supreme mugwump international confed of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment term begins on september we await your owl by no later than july yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harrys head like fireworks and he couldnt decide which to ask first after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffled looking owl a long quill and a roll of parchment with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter taking him to buy his things tomorrow weathers horrible hope youre well hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashen faced but looking very angry moved into the firelight hes not going he said hagrid grunted id like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said a what said harry interested a muggle said hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like thern an its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore wed stamp it out of him wizard indeed you knew said harry you knew im a a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew of course we knew how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats i was the only one who saw her for what she was a freak but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years then she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had you and of course i knew youd be just the same just as strange just as as abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white as soon as he found his voice he said blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how could a car crash kill lily an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgently the anger faded from hagrids face he looked suddenly anxious i never expected this he said in a low worried voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didnt know ah harry i don know if im the right person ter tell yeh but someone s gotta yeh cant go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys well its best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind i cant tell yeh everythin its a great mystry parts of it he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with with a person called but its incredible yeh dont know his name everyone in our world knows who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared blimey this is difficult see there was this wizard who went bad as bad as you could go worse worse than worse his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out could you write it down harry suggested nah cant spell it all right voldemort hagrid shuddered don make me say it again anyway this this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers got em too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right dark days harry didnt know who ter trust didnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches terrible things happened he was takin over course some stood up to him an he killed em horribly one o the only safe places left was hogwarts reckon dumbledores the only one you know who was afraid of didnt dare try takin the school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the mystry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side before probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago you was just a year old he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn sorry he said but its that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldnt find anyway you know who killed em an then an this is the real mystry of the thing he tried to kill you too wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then but he couldnt do it never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that was no ordinary cut thats what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touches yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even but it didnt work on you an thats why yer famous harry no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid was watching him sadly took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched now you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent thats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them but what happened to vol sorry i mean you know who good question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry see he was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin back most of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powers too weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harry there was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled not a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angry harry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him see said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fight havent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts yer mad his names been down ever since he was born hes off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world seven years there and he wont know himself hell be with youngsters of his own sort fer a change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks yelled uncle vernon but he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousers uncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard shouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrows be grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job why arent you supposed to do magic asked harry oh well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth in me third year they snapped me wand in half an everything but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper great man dumbledore why were you expelled its gettin late and weve got lots ter do tomorrow said hagrid loudly gotta get up ter town get all yer books an that he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry you can kip under that he said don mind if it wriggles a bit i think i still got a couple o dormice in one o the pockets chapter five diagon alley harry woke early the next morning although he could tell it was daylight he kept his eyes shut tight it was a dream he told himself firmly i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards when i open my eyes ill be at home in my cupboard there was suddenly a loud tapping noise and theres aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking but he still didnt open his eyes it had been such a good dream tap tap tap all right harry mumbled im getting up he sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beak harry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coat dont do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat hagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa what he wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pockets hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins give him five knuts said hagrid sleepily knuts the little bronze ones harry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched best be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture um hagrid mm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge boots i havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn magic dont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer parents didnt leave yeh anything but if their house was destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy nah first stop fer us is gringotts wizards bank have a sausage theyre not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday cake neither wizards have banks just the one gringotts run by goblins harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding goblins yeah so yehd be mad ter try an rob it ill tell yeh that never mess with goblins harry gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe hogwarts as a matter o fact i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly he usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him fetchin you gettin things from gringotts knows he can trust me see got everythin come on then harry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat flew said hagrid flew yeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked spells enchantments said hagrid unfolding his newspaper as he spoke they say theres dragons guardin the highsecurity vaults and then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his life ministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the page theres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advice but what does a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the country why why blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringotts well so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragon youd like one wanted one ever since i was a kid here we go they had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their tickets people stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent still got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket good said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform first year students will require three sets of plain work robes

bring an owl or a cat or a toad parents are reminded that first years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloud if yeh know where to go said hagrid harry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow i dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous place it was a tiny grubby looking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside for a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid cant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees buckle good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyes welcome back mr potter welcome back harry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out hagrid was beaming then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron doris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at last so proud mr potter im just so proud always wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutter delighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggle ive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone did you hear that he remembers me harry shook hands again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more a pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitching professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts p p potter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand c cant t tell you how p pleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell d defense against the d d dark arts muttered professor quirrell as though hed rather not think about it n not that you n need it eh p p potter he laughed nervously youll be g getting all your equipment i suppose ive g got to p pick up a new b book on vampires m myself he looked terrified at the very thought but the others wouldnt let professor quirrell keep harry to himself it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble must get on lots ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds hagrid grinned at harry told yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since scared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrella vampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can three up two across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop cauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver self stirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them yeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moon gringotts said hagrid they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harry he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglasses there were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the counter morning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key the goblin looked at it closely that seems to be in order an ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknow what in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphook griphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall whats the you know what in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked cant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steering harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sick he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knuts all yours smiled hagrid all harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag the gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook how often do you check to see if anyones inside harry asked about once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had might as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve hogwarts clear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry my fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehow harry was strongly reminded of dudley have you got your own broom the boy went on no said harry play quidditch at all no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be i do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute well no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come in thats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnt he works at hogwarts oh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt he hes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every second yes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed i think hes brilliant said harry coldly do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parents theyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boy oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent they they were a witch and wizard if thats what you mean i really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families whats your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool well ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts whats up said hagrid nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditch blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch dont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam malkins and he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sister so what is quidditch its our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules and what are slytherin and hufflepuff school houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomily better hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherin you know who was one vol sorry you know who was at hogwarts years an years ago said hagrid they bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jelly legs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridian i was trying to find out how to curse dudley im not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and minuscule glittery black beetle eyes five knuts a scoop outside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list again just yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday present harry felt himself go red you dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewel bright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wand a magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward to the last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since b c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair an old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soon harry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepy your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inches pliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of course mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes and thats where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white finger im sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly thirteen and a half inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into the world to do he shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt it it was sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightly but you dont use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sit said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand arm er well im right handed said harry hold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxes that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once maple and phoenix feather seven inches quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too was snatched back by mr ollivander no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inches springy go on go on try it out harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr ollivander was waiting for the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wands mr ollivander pulled from the shelves the happier he seemed to become tricky customer eh not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inches nice and supple harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curious sorry said harry but whats curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare i remember every wand ive ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why its brother gave you that scar harry swallowed yes thirteen and a half inches yew curious indeed how these things happen the wand chooses the wizard remember i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he who must not be named did great things terrible yes but great harry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he said he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the words everyone thinks im special he said at last all those people in the leaky cauldron professor quirrell mr ollivander but i dont know anything about magic at all how can they expect great things im famous and i cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents died hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile don you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find me see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone chapter six the journey from platform nine and three quarters harrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at all half terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a while harry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first on the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the room er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening er i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt harry supposed that meant yes thank you he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke funny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have they harry didnt say anything where is this school anyway i dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket i just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven oclock he read his aunt and uncle stared platform what nine and three quarters dont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and three quarters its on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll see you just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendly taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings harry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off they reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face well there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do they he was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away all three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someone he stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and three quarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panic according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and ten at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying packed with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owl heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying now whats the platform number said the boys mother nine and three quarters piped a small girl also red headed who was holding her hand mom cant i go youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished fred you next the plump woman said im not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cara you tell im george sorry george dear only joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywhere there was nothing else for it excuse me harry said to the plump woman hello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose yes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded not to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before ron er okay said harry he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solid he started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and three quarters on it he had done it smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat he passed a round faced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot want a hand it was one of the red haired twins hed followed through the barrier yes please harry panted oy fred cmere and help with the twins help harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes whats that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harrys lightning scar blimey said the other twin are you he is said the first twin arent you he added to harry what said harry harry potter chorused the twins oh him said harry i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red then to his relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door fred george are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying their mother had just taken out her handkerchief ron youve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose mom geroff he wriggled free aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins shut up said ron wheres percy said their mother hes coming now the oldest boy came striding into sight he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter p on it cant stay long mother he said im up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise you should have said something we had no idea hang on i think i remember him saying something about it said the other twin once or twice a minute all summer oh shut up said percy the prefect how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins because hes a prefect said their mother fondly all right dear well have a good term send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left then she turned to the twins now you two this year you behave yourselves if i get one more owl telling me youve youve blown up a toilet or blown up a toilet weve never blown up a toilet great idea though thanks mom its not funny and look after ron dont worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it hey mom guess what guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him looking you know that black haired boy who was near us in the station know who he is who harry potter harry heard the little girls voice oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom eh please youve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isnt something you goggle at in a zoo is he really fred how do you know asked him saw his scar its really there like lightning poor dear no wonder he was alone i wondered he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what you know who looks like their mother suddenly became very stern i forbid you to ask him fred no dont you dare as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye and their younger sister began to cry dont ginny well send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat george only joking mom the train began to move harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose hey ron the twins were back listen were going down the middle of the train lee jordans got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves fred and george weasley and this is ron our brother see you later then bye said harry and ron the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them are you really harry potter ron blurted out harry nodded oh well i thought it might be one of fred and georges jokes said ron and have you really got you know he pointed at harrys forehead harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar ron stared so thats where you know who yes said harry but i cant remember it nothing said ron eagerly well i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him er yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about him so you must know loads of magic already the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked about i heard you went to live with muggles said ron what are they like horrible well not all of them my aunt and uncle and cousin are though wish id had three wizard brothers five said ron for some reason he was looking gloomy im the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts you could say ive got a lot to live up to bill and charlie have already left bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch now percys a prefect fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyre really funny everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do its no big deal because they did it first you never get anything new either with five brothers ive got bills old robes charlies old wand and percys old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep his names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers instead rons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the window harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron up and until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped what said harry you said you know whos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the class you wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridor he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat hungry are you starving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs theyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him no said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore so this is dumbledore said harry dont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappeared hes gone well you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collecting rons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped help yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beans you want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a booger flavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner bleaaargh see sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepper the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearful sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry yes said the boy miserably well if you see him he left dont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talk the rat was still snoozing on rons lap he might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end unicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again the toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes has anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth weve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his hand oh are you doing magic lets see it then she sat down ron looked taken aback er all right he cleared his throat sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep are you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart either im ron weasley ron muttered harry potter said harry are you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed goodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her whatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry gryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin thats the house vol i mean you know who was in yeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressed you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school charlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault harry stared really what happened to them nothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case you know whos behind it harry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know who was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying whats your quidditch team ron asked er i dont know any harry confessed what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alley is it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is it yes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget draco malfoy looked at him think my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take it i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly draco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks id be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up say that again ron said his face as red as his hair oh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneered unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron but we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail i think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleep and so he had youve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley ive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after you know who disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with something youd better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we change all right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing down he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor the train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harry hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads cmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice ye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers no moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door everyone here you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door chapter seven the sorting hat the door swung open at once a tall black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to cross the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid i will take them from here she pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the start of term banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hair i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left the chamber harry swallowed how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron some sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed what the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearly white and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years nobody answered new students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavens harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the house maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all theres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends so put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again so weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a troll harry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannah a pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hat the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcalling bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school he had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him finch fletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandy haired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted the hat ron groaned a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself there werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sally anne and then at last potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waited hmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin not slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water he could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirtell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban and now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there welcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or not is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harry harrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugs the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat it was all delicious that does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive in troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsy porpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandy haired seamus finnigan interrupted nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wanted like this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangements how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest ive never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jell o rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families im half and half said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed what about you neville said ron well my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin it happened very suddenly the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys forehead ouch harry clapped a hand to his head what is it asked percy n nothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at all whos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him again at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silent ahern just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few start of term notices to give you first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch and finally i must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did hes not serious he muttered to percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest ah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourself a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percy peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again the bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five four posters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed great food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at all chapter eight the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes there were a hundred and forty two staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk the ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed up professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight professor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head start friday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge double potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able to see if its true wish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before just then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far at the start of term banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated him potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys name ah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmth they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had y caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the air i dont know sit said harry snapes lips curled into a sneer tut tut fame clearly isnt everything he ignored hermiones hand lets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter i dont know sit thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling i dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winked snape however was not pleased sit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville you potter why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron doi push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer up said ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang back hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open hang on he said back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound there was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robes harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her fitch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the students but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should he yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said that hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts break in latest investigations continue into the break in at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day but were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the date hagrid said harry that gringotts break in happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry chapter nine the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still first year gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together typical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else you dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talk malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail harry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke its a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand harry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash whats going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him at three thirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up upf everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for years now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lips come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tear streaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hard faced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watch malfoy smiled nastily i think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom no shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move youll get us all into trouble harry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunned give it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried harry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfay like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady a few people below were clapping no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist harry potter his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet trembling never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifth year boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confused follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard out peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys potter this is oliver wood wood ive found you a seeker woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a natural ive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly woods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained hes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven id say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we cant bend the first year rule heaven knows we need a better team than last year flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldnt look severus snape in the face for weeks professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry i want to hear youre training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himself youre joking it was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about it seeker he said but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry i start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over well done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too beaters i tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the school bet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle having a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the muggles youre a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizards duel wands only no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my second well a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up it was hermione granger cant a person eat in peace in this place said ron hermione ignored him and spoke to harry i couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be its really very selfish of you and its really none of your business said harry good bye said ron all the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to block them there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to face he couldnt miss it half past eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harry a lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown you said ron furiously go back to bed i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes a prefect hed put a stop to this harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering come on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole hermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose dont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower now what am i going to do she asked shrilly thats your problem said ron weve got to go we re going to be late they hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them im coming with you she said you are not dyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up youve got some nerve said ron loudly shut up both of you said harry sharply i heard something it was a sort of snuffling mrs norris breathed ron squinting through the dark it wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer thank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewhere hows your arm said harry fine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville if either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept by hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered then a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris horror struck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room i think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you weve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her that lets go it wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them it was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight shut up peeves please youll get us thrown out peeves cackled wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughty not if you dont give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shouts oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening which way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell me say please dont mess with me peeves now where did they go shant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice all right please nothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage he thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far they werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbidden they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three heads three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death hed take filch they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs it was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again what do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open no we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was chapter ten halloween malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said harry but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog again hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed them ron couldnt resist it its not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousand what did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing i hope boys he squeaked potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sit said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he added harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the team so i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand i thought you werent speaking to us said harry yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top as seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to him very nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate inside were four different sized balls right said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each side three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited so thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt it whats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quickly now theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box ill show you now said wood take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat im going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box stand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgers at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think youve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off very good said wood er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand never at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open dont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep well thats it any questions harry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem we wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch harry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrived now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wasnt having much more luck wingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill youre saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its wing gar dium levi o sa make the gar nice and long you do it then if youre so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosa their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermione harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears i think she heard you so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friends hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the start of term banquet harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint there was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silence prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element follow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons arm ive just thought hermione what about her she doesnt know about the troll ron bit his lip oh all right he snapped but percyd better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view whats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footsteps hes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight it was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room the keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained up oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron its the girls bathroom harry gasped hermione they said together it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran inside hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall the troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went oy pea brain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosa the club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble harry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done it was hermione who spoke first is it dead i dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue urgh troll boogers he wiped it on the trolls trousers a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up they hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were white hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand down then a small voice came out of the shadows please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweets miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron well i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled five you mean once shes taken off hermiones good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded him they had reached the portrait of the fat lady pig snout they said and entered the common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them chapter eleven quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots the quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress it was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also tent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway whats that youve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages harry showed him library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape give it to me five points from gryffindor hes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his leg dunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterly the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answer he knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes snape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandages blasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulped i just wondered if i could have my book back get out out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs did you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matter in a low whisper harry told them what hed seen you know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that three headed dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermiones eyes were wide no he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something snapped ron im with harry i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forget the next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match youve got to eat some breakfast i dont want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione im not hungry harry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the field harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green wood cleared his throat for silence okay men he said and women said chaser angelina johnson and women wood agreed this is it the big one said fred weasley the one weve all been waiting for said george we know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in years were going to win i know it he glared at them all as if to say or else right its time good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers madam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt braver mount your brooms please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall and shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle thats chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins thats adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley cant tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet eh nope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yet kept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plan keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitch once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear harry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life foul screamed the gryffindors madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean said ron red card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the game but this isnt soccer dean ron reminded him hagrid however was on deans side they oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like that it happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him lee was still commentating slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score a no the slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went dunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broom but he cant have suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd what are you doing moaned ron gray faced i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath hes doing something jinxing the broom said hermione what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robes it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire a sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened it was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutes harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand ive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion he didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermione it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truth i found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that three headed dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guarding hagrid dropped the teapot how do you know about fluffy he said fluffy yeah hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly now dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that is but snapes trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione the afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape i know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw him im tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself chapter twelve the mirror of erised christmas was coming one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms worst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckled harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family it was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charlie when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches nah im all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs weasley ron let go of the front of malfoys robes he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked just one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree the library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yeh oh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermione unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name somewhere im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts what are you looking for boy nothing said harry madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him youd better get out then go on out wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up to harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks five minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their heads they went off to lunch you will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron itd be safe to ask them very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt work ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and battered like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe you too said harry will you look at this ive got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrys harry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl a second very small parcel contained a note we received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fifty pence piece thats friendly said harry ron was fascinated by the fifty pence weird he said nmat a shape this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these i think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroon thats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione this only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped it something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gasped ive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is theyre really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into material its an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell it is look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely theres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it well a very merry christmas to you there was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloak id give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matter nothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look harrys got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family why arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warm i hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head you havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forge whats all th is noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized p for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got one i dont want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew and youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for family they frog marched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a grow your own warts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his four poster harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it his fathers this had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had said he had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wide awake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole whos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridor where should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked the library was pitch black and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps the restricted section was right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at all one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be he had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his ears he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being solid he backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in it looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of it he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him but the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror there he was reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror she was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys did harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection mom he whispered dad they just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come back and hurried from the room you could have woken me up said ron crossly you can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirror id like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly and i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anything harry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour im freezing said ron lets forget it and go back no harry hissed i know its here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor its here just here yes they pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror there they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of him see harry whispered i cant see anything look look at them all there are loads of them i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas ron though was staring transfixed at his image look at me he said can you see all your family standing around you no im alone but im different i look older and im head boy what i am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror shows the future how can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time youre only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parents dont push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and left this isnt safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us come on and ron pulled harry out of the room the snow still hadnt melted the next morning want to play chess harry said ron no why dont we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonight why not i dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione im serious harry dont go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop him that third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyone and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except so back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him i didnt see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didnt know it was called that sir but i expect youve realized by now what it does it well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all harry shook his head let me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is does that help harry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up sir professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks harry stared one can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on giving me books it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these drearns hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel was they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhere once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again wood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms will you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too its not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her dont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee dont play said hermione at once say youre ill said ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggested really break your leg said ron i cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head i dont want more trouble he mumbled youve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier theres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry youre worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherin nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog thanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermione ive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself at last she found what she was looking for i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stone this didnt have quite the effect shed expected the what said harry and ron oh honestly dont you two read look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fifty eight see said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it and no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixty five is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match im going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermione as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve i know ron snapped dont nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside dont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watch harrys heart did a somersault dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was right there was no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too ive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoy oh sorry weasley didnt see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley ron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy im worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying something rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry im warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet youre in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy ron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby white faced and tight lipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed harry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followed the trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there too harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were saying d dont know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p places severus oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy students arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after all harry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yet b b but severus i you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him i i dont know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocus pocus im waiting b but i d d dont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified harry where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heard so we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm itll be gone by next tuesday said ron chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yet every time they passed the third floor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes harry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamel but were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it a what am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work ill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forget me not blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening don go shoutin about it whats the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about whats guarding the stone apart from fluffy shhhh said hagrid again listen come an see me later im not promisin ill tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren spposed ter know theyll think ive told yeh see you later then said harry hagrid shuffled off what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully do you think it had anything to do with the stone im going to see what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table dragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guide hagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry but its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romania but there arent wild dragons in britain said harry of course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forget so what on earths hagrid up to said hermione when they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them it was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused so yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him course i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermione well i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantments professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snape snape yeah yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffy youre the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly well thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boiling cant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it too hagrid whats that but he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermione well ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on i em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diffrent eggs what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnt hagrid you live in a wooden house she said but hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut wonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nuts then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid he had written only two words its hatching ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of it hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching weve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing shut up harry whispered malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at all ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited its nearly out he ushered them inside the egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes it sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snout isnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window whats the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking him malfoy had seen the dragon something about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him just let him go harry urged set him free i cant said hagrid hes too little hed die they looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor ive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommy hes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys ear hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip i i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him i cant harry suddenly turned to ron charlie he said youre losing it too said ron im ron remember no charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragons we could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him the following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window its hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note dear ron how are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragon could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still dark send me an answer as soon as possible love charlie they looked at one another weve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy there was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonous harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down itll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep its too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them i wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i cant handle when they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg aargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off bye bye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easier nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flared professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear detention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig malfoys got detention i could sing dont harry advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness charlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much at last norbert was going going gone they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darkness well well well he whispered we are in trouble theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower chapter fifteen the foribidden forest things couldnt have been worse filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was out of bounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already had harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them i would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue i think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch match fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor please you cant dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lo st them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like them theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably well no ron admitted it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as well known but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence harry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions then about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closer all right all right he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other end harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddling all the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his anti dark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry could go to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks the forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noise thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione i shouldnt be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness malfoy now turned to hagrid im not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer thats how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled copyin lines what goods that ter anyone yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack go on malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the path right now were gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent directions theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fangs long teeth all right but i warn yeh hes a coward said hagrid so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco neville an fangll go the other now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets go the forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right they walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away i knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved whos there hagrid called show yerself im armed and into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaurs hand good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose in this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way students up at the school an this is ronan you two hes a centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly a bit well thats something ronan sighed he flung back his head and stared at the sky mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan didnt answer immediately he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always the innocent are the first victims he said so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur black haired and bodied and wilder looking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked skyward mars is bright tonight he said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry did that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids arm hagrid look red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here in the first place the minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closer it was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet yes thank you what was that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs in anger for the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what was going on whys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a half life a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlight but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shaking snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose thats written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort harry everyone says dumbledores the only one you know who was ever afraid of with dumbledore around you know who wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortune telling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent over when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in case chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam was history of magic one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the rest that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry i think its a warning it means dangers coming ron couldnt get worked up it was too hot harry relax hermiones right the stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jumped to his feet wherere you going said ron sleepily ive just thought of something said harry he had turned white weve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up dont you think its a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt answer hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl hullo he said smiling finished yer exams got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off no were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows its not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head thats the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to remember yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after so i told him an i said what id always really wanted was a dragon an then i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks lets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted but he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old home so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy and did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked try ing to keep his voice calm well yeah how many three headed dogs dyeh meet even around hogwarts so i told him fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified i shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey wherere yeh goin harry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds weve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall what are you three doing inside it was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of books we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do why harry swallowed now what its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flared professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once hes gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor its about the sorcerers tone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up how do you know she spluttered professor i think i know that sn that someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protected but professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didnt its tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight hes found out everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled round snape was standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were harry began without any idea what he was going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre up to something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them back be warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone steps harry turned to the others right heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it hermione youd better do that why me its obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape and wed better stay outside the third floor corridor harry told ron come on but that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in im sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only just got away i dont know where snape went well thats it then isnt it harry said the other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes were glittering im going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone first youre mad said ron you cant said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said youll be expelled so whap harry shouted dont you understand if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them youre right harry said hermione in a small voice ill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron all all three of us oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without us id better go and took through my books there might be something useful but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this was the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break harry and ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singing he ran back down to the common room wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty faces youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists im ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalus she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror whatve you done to him harry whispered its the full body bind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip whos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings a creeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother you and he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron a few seconds later they were there outside the third floor corridor and the door was already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at its feet hermione whispered looks like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here goes he put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dogs back want to go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing just black theres no way of climbing down well just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there was no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry whats this stuff were his first words dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be miles under the school she said lucky this plant things here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is its devils snare oh im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest devils snare devils snare what did professor sprout say it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked yes of course but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her hands have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis theres no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a dragon a fully grown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think its a ghost i dont know sounds like wings to me theres light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full of small jewel bright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once well theres no other choice ill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it was locked the other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these birds they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys yes look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big old fashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting things other people didnt after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom weve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces now what do we do harry whispered its obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this needs thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black pieces harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you next to him instead of that castle what about you im going to be a knight said ron the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares ron started to direct the black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones were nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly its the only way ive got to be taken nof harry and hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices i take one step forward and shell take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three spaces to the left the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway what if hes hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprouts that was the devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs come on i cant breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting bidden in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic its logic a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever but so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hands got it she said the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle theres only enough there for one of us he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab brooms from the flying key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him really but harry what if you know whos with him well i was lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him hermione harry youre a great wizard you know im not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him me said hermione books and cleverness there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be careful you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered its not poison said harry anxiously no but its like ice quick go before it wears off good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flames here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber there was already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort chapter seventeen the man with two faces it was quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all me he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect p p poor st stuttering p professor quirrell harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried to kill me no no no i tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that three headed dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell it was the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but hes in london ill be far away by the time he gets back all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected me all along tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break it harrys mind was racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see myseff finding it which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking to himself what does this mirror do how does it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his feet come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scared looking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out of the way he said as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips he lies he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to him face to face master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what was going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backward dont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end as your parents they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face was now smiling how touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parents were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needle sharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony master i cannot hold him my hands my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in harrys own head crying harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the stone then who does sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sit the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it was you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed its all for the best but that means he and his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry ive been thinking sir even if the stones gone vol i mean you know who call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has he no harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other things id like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here and theres something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir theres one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bettie botts every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth then he choked and said alas ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict just five minutes harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that was the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in harry hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole schools talking about it said ron what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stones gone said ron finally flamels just going to die thats what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floor dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly after a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said stiffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears its all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hands i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got loads hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a present its not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got yeh this it seemed to be a handsome leather covered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts now as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fifty two ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and slytherin four hundred and seventy two a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smiles faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few last minute points to dish out let me see yes first to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the best played game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty points gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there was silence again second to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty points hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty points the din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kinds of courage said dumbledore smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the body bind curse put on him which means dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts it was the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good marks hermione of course had the best grades of the first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the holidays i always hope theyll forget to give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bettie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and three quarters at kings cross station it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles you must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where im going i promise you said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together there he is mom there he is look it was ginny weasley rons younger sister but she wasnt pointing at ron harry potter she squealed look mom i can see be quiet ginny and its rude to point mrs weasley smiled down at them busy year she said very said harry thanks for the fudge and the sweater mrs weasley oh it was nothing dear ready are you it was uncle vernon still purple faced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry you must be harrys family said mrs weasley in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry up boy we havent got all day he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione see you over the summer then hope you have er a good holiday said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant oh i will said harry and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face they dont know were not allowed to use magic at home im going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer the

test for independence guidelines for gene nomenclature a glossary g index i preface a note from the authors the science of genetics is less than years old but its accomplishments within that short time have been astonishing gregor mendel first described genes as abstract units of inheritance in his work was ignored and then rediscovered in thomas hunt morgan and his students provided experimental verification of the idea that genes reside within chromosomes during the years by oswald avery and his coworkers had established that genes are made of dna james watson and francis crick published their pathbreaking structure of dna in remarkably less than years later in an international consortium of investigators deciphered the sequence of the billion nucleotides in the human genome twentieth century genetics made it possible to identify individual genes and to understand a great deal about their functions today scientists are able to access the enormous amounts of genetic data generated by the sequencing of many organisms genomes analysis of these data will result in a deeper understanding of the complex molecular interactions within and among vast networks of genes proteins and other molecules that help bring organisms to life finding new methods and tools for analyzing these data will be a significant part of genetics in the twenty first century our sixth edition of genetics from genes to genomes emphasizes both the core concepts of genetics and the cutting edge discoveries modern tools and analytic methods that will keep the science of genetics moving forward the authors of the sixth edition have worked together in revising every chapter in an effort not only to provide the most up to date information but also to provide continuity and the clearest possible explanations of difficult concepts in one voice our focus an integrated approach genetics from genes to genomes represents a new approach to an undergraduate course in genetics it reflects the way we the authors currently view the molecular basis of life we integrate formal genetics the rules by which genes are transmitted molecular genetics the structure of dna and how it directs the structure of proteins digital analysis and genomics recent technologies that allow a comprehensive analysis of the entire gene set and its expression in an organism human genetics how genes contribute to health and diseases including cancer the unity of life forms the synthesis of information from many different organisms into coherent models molecular evolution the molecular mechanisms by which biological systems whole organisms and populations have evolved and diverged the strength of this integrated approach is that students who complete the book will have a strong command of genetics as it is practiced today by both academic and corporate researchers these scientists are rapidly changing our understanding of living organisms including ourselves ultimately this vital research may create the ability to replace or correct detrimental genes those inborn errors of metabolism as researcher archibald garrod called them in as well as the later genetic alterations that lead to the many forms of cancer the genetic way of thinking modern genetics is a molecular level science but an understanding of its origins and the discovery of its principles is a necessary context to encourage a genetic way of thinking we begin the book by reviewing mendels principles and the chromosomal basis of inheritance from the outset however we aim to integrate organism level genetics with fundamental molecular mechanisms chapter presents the foundation of this integration by summarizing the main biological themes we explore in chapter we tie mendels studies of pea trait inheritance to the actions of enzymes that determine whether a pea is round or wrinkled yellow or green etc in the same chapter we point to the relatedness of the patterns of heredity in all organisms chapters cover extensions to mendel the chromosome theory of inheritance and the fundamentals of gene linkage and mapping starting in chapter we focus on the physical characteristics of dna on mutations and on how dna encodes copies and transmits biological information beginning in chapter we move into the digital revolution in dna analysis with a look at modern genetics techniques including gene cloning pcr microarrays and high throughput genome sequencing we explore how bioinformatics an emergent analytical tool can aid in discovery of genome features this section concludes in chapter with case studies leading to the discovery of human disease genes the understanding of molecular and computer based techniques carries into our discussion of chromosome specifics in chapters and also informs our analysis of gene regulation in chapters and chapter describes the most recent technology that scientists can use to manipulate genomes at will for research and practical purposes including gene therapy chapter describes the use of genetic tools at the molecular level to uncover the complex interactions of eukaryotic development in chapter we explain how our understanding of genetics and the development of molecular genetic technologies is enabling us to comprehend cancer and in some cases to cure it chapters and cover population genetics with a view of how molecular tools have provided information on species relatedness and on genome changes at the molecular level over time in addition we explain how bioinformatics can be combined with population genetics to understand inheritance of complex traits and to trace human ancestry throughout our book we present the scientific reasoning of some of the ingenious researchers of the field from mendel to watson and crick to the collaborators on the human genome project we hope student readers will see that genetics is not simply a set of data and facts but also a human endeavor that relies on contributions from exceptional individuals student friendly features as digital components of the text become more and more crucial we are very excited that janice fischer a textbook author is taking on a dual role as digital editor janice will ensure the important consistency between text and digital we have taken great pains to help the student make the leap to a deeper understanding of genetics numerous features of this book were developed with that goal in mind one voice genetics genes to genomes has a friendly engaging reading style that helps students master the concepts throughout this book the writing style provides the student with the focus and continuity required to make the book successful in the classroom visualizing genetics the highly specialized art program developed for this book integrates photos and line art in a manner that provides the most engaging visual presentation of genetics available our feature figure illustrations break down complex processes into step by step illustrations that lead to greater student understanding all illustrations are rendered with a consistent color theme for example all presentations of phosphate groups are the same color as are all presentations of mrna accessibility our intention is to bring cutting edge content to the student level a number of more complex illustrations are revised and segmented to help the student follow the process legends have been streamlined to highlight only the most important ideas and throughout the book topics and examples have been chosen to focus on the most critical information problem solving developing strong problem solving skills is vital for every genetics student the authors have carefully created problem sets at the end of each chapter that allow students to improve upon their problem solving ability solved problems these cover topical material with complete answers provide insight into the step by step process of problem solving review problems more than questions involving a variety of levels of difficulty that develop excellent problem solving skills the problems are organized by chapter section and in order of increasing difficulty within each section for ease of use by instructors and students the companion online study guide and solutions manual completely revised for the th edition by michael goldberg and janice fischer provides detailed analysis of strategies to solve all of the end of chapter problems i the following figure shows a screen shot from the ucsc genome browser focusing on a region of the human genome encoding a gene called mfap l note hg refers to version of the human genome refseq if you do not remember how the browser represents the genome refer to the key at the bottom of fig source university of california genome project https genome ucsc edu a describe in approximate terms the genomic location of mfap l b is the gene transcribed in the direction from the centromere to telomere or from the telomere tocentromere c how many alternative splice forms of mfap l mrna are indicated by the data b the arrows within the introns of the gene show that the direction of transcription is from the telomere of q toward the centromere of chromosome c the data indicate four alternatively spliced forms of the mrna in the following parts we list these as a to d from top to bottom d the data suggest two promoters one is roughly at position and allows the transcription of a primary rna alternatively spliced to produce mrnas b and d the other is roughly at position and leads to the transcription of a primary rna alternatively spliced to generate mrnas a and c e the data indicate that the mfap gene can encode two different but closely related proteins mrnas a b and c all encode the same protein mrna d a slightly larger protein that includes at its n terminus additional amino acids not found in the other protein otherwise these two proteins appear to be the same the orf that encodes the a b c protein form is about bp

chapter outline creating transgenic organisms uses of transgenic organisms targeted mutagenesis human gene therapy learning objectives learning objectives appear before each section and are carefully written to clearly outline expectations uses of transgenic organisms learning objectives describe how transgenes can clarify which gene causes a mutant phenotype summarize the use of transgene reporter constructs in gene expression studies discuss examples of how transgenic organisms serve to produce proteins needed for human health list examples of gm organisms and discuss the pros and cons of their production explain the use of transgenic animals to model gain of function genetic diseases in humans essential concepts a wild type transgene can be inserted into an embryo homozygous for a recessive mutant allele if the normal phenotype is restored then the transgene identifies the gene that was mutated the creation of reporter constructs allows easy detection of when and in which tissues a gene is turned on or turned off in eukaryotes transgenic organisms produce medically important human proteins including insulin blood clotting factors and erythropoietin transgenic crop plants can potentially make ingestible vaccines gm soybeans are resistant to the weed killer glyphosate many crops such as corn soybean canola and cotton have been genetically modified to express bt protein which discourages insect predation adding a transgene that carries a disease causing gainof function allele to a nonhuman animal model allows researchers to observe disease progression and to

michael goldberg and janice fischer several new fast forward genetics and society and tools of genetics boxes covering modern topics were created for breadth and clarity chapter in the th edition was split into two separate chapters in the th edition chapter digital analysis of dna and chapter genome annotation figure one site specific recombination mechanism the cre and flp enzymes discussed in the text function as shown the red and blue target dna sequences are identical to each other but are represented in different colors for clarity these targets are embedded in different dna molecules black and gray dots the subunits of the recombinase tetramer are yellow ovals this enzyme catalyzes all steps of the reaction black triangles are sites where recombinase cleaves single stranded dna note that resolution of the holliday junction intermediate involves cleavage of the blue and red dna strands that were not cleaved initially genome editing by crispr cas the sgrna sequence is designed to bring the cas endonuclease to a specific target in the genome repair after cas cleavage can result in a knockout or a knockin depending on whether or not a dna fragment suitable for homologous recombination is introduced nhej nonhomologous end joining visualizing x chromosome inactivation in transgenic mice scientists have recently used molecular techniques and transgenic technology similar to that described in the earlier fast forward box transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor to visualize the pattern of x chromosome inactivation in mice the researchers generated xx mice containing two different transgenes in this case genes from a different species one of these transgenes was a jellyfish gene that specifies green fluorescent protein gfp the other was a gene from red coral that makes red fluorescent protein rfp fig a in the xx mice the gfp gene is located on the x chromosome from the mother and the rfp gene resides on the x chromosome from the father clonal patches of cells are either green or red depending on which x chromosome was turned into a barr body in the original cell that established the patch fig b different xx mice display different green and red patchwork patterns providing a clear demonstration of the random nature of x chromosome inactivation the patchwork patterns reflect the cellular memory of which x chromosome was inactivated in the founder cell for each clonal patch geneticists currently use these transgenic mice to decipher the genetic details of how cells remember which x to inactivate after each cell division fa s t f o r wa r d visualizing x chromosome inactivation in transgenic mice figure b heart cells of a transgenic mouse reveal a clonal patchwork of x inactivation patches of red or green cells represent cellular descendants of the founders that randomly inactivated one of their x chromosomes figure a cells of transgenic mice glow either green or red in response to x chromosome inactivation the mouse carries a green gfp transgene inserted in the maternal x chromosome xm and a red rfp transgene in the paternal x chromosome xp cells in which xp is inactivated top glow green cells glow red bottom when xm is inactivated fast forward this feature is one of the methods used to integrate the mendelian principles introduced early in the content with the molecular content that will follow how bacteria vaccinate themselves against viral infections with crispr cas researchers discovered clustered sequence repeats crisprs in bacterial genomes as early as when in some of these sequences were found to originate from bacteriophage genomes several astute scientists speculated that crisprs might mediate a viral immunity system in bacteria these ideas were largely ignored for several more years until the mechanism of resistance became clarified and finally in the so called crispr craze reached its full bloom when researchers including feng zhang jennifer doudna and emmanuelle charpentier developed methods to adapt this viral immunity system to engineer genomes in bacterial cells and in eukaryotic organisms at the crispr locus of bacterial genomes short direct repeats are interrupted at regular intervals by unique spacer sequences fig a the spacer sequences are fragments of bacteriophage genomes captured by the host cell and integrated into the host genome by the action of two bacterially encoded cas proteins cas and cas the repeats within the crispr arrays are added by these endonucleolytic enzymes during the capture and integration process viral immunity results from steps that begin with transcription of the crispr array into long rna molecules called pre crrnas that are processed into short nt socalled crispr rnas crrnas in the bacterial species tools of genetics essays current readings explain various techniques and tools used by geneticists including examples of applications in biology and medicine the human microbiome project established in and funded by the u s national institutes of health the human microbiome project hmp fig a is one of several international consortia aiming to understand the complex relationship between our bodies and the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit them the hmp has already achieved its first goal of describing the diversity of the organisms that make up the human microbiome investigators analyzed the microbial metagenomes located at several different sites in the bodies of more than people from around the globe these studies focused on the sequence of the gene encoding the s rrna of the ribosomal small subunit of these bacteria because these sequences diverge substantially in different bacterial species and thus serve as markers for those species the results showed that a single person can harbor up to different bacterial species but people vary widely in the types of bacteria that make up their microbiome thus it appears that worldwide more than different bacterial species colonize human bodies the researchers of the hmp have already sequenced the complete genomes of many of these kinds of bacteria the second phase of the hmp began in and is aimed ultimately at determining whether changes in the microbiome are the causes or effects of diseases or other important traits in humans diseases potentially linked to the microbiome include cancer acne psoriasis diabetes obesity and inflammatory bowel disease some investigators have suggested that the composition of microbiomes could also influence the mental health of their hosts the first step in these studies will be to establish whether statistical correlations exist between specific kinds of microbial communities and disease states as one example one hmp phase ii project currently underway is an analysis of vaginal host cells and microbes during pregnancy approximately pregnant women will be studied and their birth outcomes recorded the goal of this project is to determine if changes in the microbiome correlate with premature birth or other complications of pregnancy of course the existence of any correlations found between microbiomes and disease does not prove cause or effect but even if bacteria correlated with a disease state do not cause the disease the existence of the correlation could be useful as a way to diagnose certain conditions nevertheless the most an effect one method is to investigate in detail how the biological properties of the microbiome and the host might be changed by the interactions of bacteria and the humans they colonize thus scientists will characterize whether and how the transcriptomes and proteomes of the bacteria and human cells are changed by bacterial colonization of human organs these studies will further delve into metabolomics characterizing metabolites in the human bloodstream a second and even more powerful method for establishing the cause and effect of microbiome changes is the use of germ free mice raised in sterile environments surprisingly germ free mice can survive although they are not normal they have altered immune systems poor skin and they need to eat more calories than do normal mice to maintain a normal body weight researchers can populate germ free mice with a single bacterial species or a complex microbial community and thus determine how microbiomes influence physiological states problem at the end of this chapter will allow you to explore this approach by discussing an experiment recently performed with germ free mice that asks if the microbiome plays a causal role in obesity if microbial communities indeed contribute to disease states in humans then future treatments might aim to alter resident microbiomes thus the flip side of the hmp is to visualizing genetics full color illustrations and photographs bring the printed word to life these visual reinforcements support and further clarify the topics discussed throughout the text the watson and c the double helix structure of dna a watson and crick took the known facts about dnas chemical composition and its physical arrangement in space and constructed a wire frame model that could explain the molecules function b in the model two dna chains spiral around an axis with the sugar phosphate backbones on the outside and flat pairs of bases meeting in the middle one chain runs to upward while the other runs in the opposite direction of to downward in short the two chains are antiparallel the two chains wrap around each other once every base pairs or once every the result is a double helix that looks like a twisted ladder with the two spiraling structural members composed of sugarphosphate backbones and the perpendicular rungs consisting of base pairs c in a space filling representation of the model the overall shape is that of a grooved cylinder with a diameter of the backbones spiral around the axis of the double helix like threads on a screw because two backbones exist there are two threads and these two threads are vertically displaced from each other this displacement of the backbones generates two grooves one the major groove much wider than the other the minor groove the two chains of the double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs a t and g c the spatial requirements of the double helix require that each base pair must consist of one small pyrimidine and one large purine and even then only for the particular pairings of a t and g c in contrast a c and g t pairs do not fit well and cannot easily form hydrogen bonds although any one nucleotide pair forms only two or three hydrogen bonds the sum of these connections between successive base pairs in a long dna molecule composed of thousands of nucleotides is a key to the molecules great chemical stability feature figures special multipage spreads integrate line art photos and text to summarize in detail important genetic concepts pour heated molten agarose into a clear acrylic plate to which a comb has been attached with clamps allow the agarose to cool and harden remove the comb shallow wells will be left in the gel remove the gel from the acrylic plate and transfer it to a tank containing a bu ered solution use a micropipette to load a di erent dna sample into each well of the gel each sample contains a blue dye to make it easier to see one sample should contain dna molecules of known length to serve as size markers expose the gel to ultraviolet uv light dna molecules will fluoresce as orange bands because the ethidium bromide bound to the dna absorbs uv photons and gives o photons in the visible red range you can estimate the size of the dna molecules in the unknown samples by comparing their migration in the gel with that of the size markers standards in the lane at the left the tank contains electrode wires placed along each end of the gel attach these electrodes to a power supply when you switch on the current the negatively charged dna molecules in each sample migrate toward the end of the box along the paths lanes shown by the orange arrows smaller dna molecules will move faster toward the end than larger dna molecules separating dna molecules according to their size by agarose gel electrophoresis to prepare an agarose gel with wells for samples you pour the gel as shown in step you then transfer the gel to a tank containing a buffered solution with ions that allow current to flow and load dna samples in the wells step you then connect the gel tank to a power supply and allow electrophoresis to run from to hours depending on the dna size and the voltage step after incubating the gel with the fluorescent dye ethidium bromide step you then expose the gel to uv light step dna molecules will appear as orange bands because they bind to the fluorescent dye step shows actual results from gel electrophoresis because black and white film was used dna appears white rather than orange the standard lane at left has dna fragments of known sizes human genomic dna was cut with ecori in lane a and with rsai in lane b smears containing hundreds of thousands of fragments are produced with an average size of about kb for ecori and bp for rsai in c d and e the chromosome of bacteriophage was cut with hindiii ecori and rsai respectively the sizes of the fragments in any one lane add up to kb the size of the viral genome in f g and h plasmid dna of total length kb was cut with the same three enzymes note that the larger the genome analyzed the more fragments are produced moreover the more bases in the restriction enzyme recognition site the larger is the average size of the fragments produced remove the gel from the tank incubate in a solution containing ethidium bromide which binds to dna then wash with water to remove excess dye from the gel expose the gel to ultraviolet uv light dna molecules will fluoresce as orange bands because the ethidium bromide bound to the dna absorbs uv photons and gives o photons in the visible red range you can estimate the size of the dna molecules in the unknown samples by comparing their migration in the gel with that of the size markers standards in the lane at the left process figures step by step descriptions allow

envelope chromatin e telophase nuclear membranes and nucleoli re form spindle fibers disappear chromosomes uncoil and become a tangle of chromatin comparative figures comparison illustrations lay out the basic differences of often confusing principles genomic dna from a womans blood cells is pcr amplified by a single pair of primers representing a unique locus in the genome the pcr products are then sequenced by the sanger method using one of the pcr primers as a sequencing primer the following figure shows a trace of just part of the sequence read in an f hybrid plant the allele for round peas r is found on one chromosome and the allele for wrinkled peas r is on the homologous chromosome the pairing between the two homologous chromosomes during prophase through metaphase of meiosis i makes sure that the homologs will separate to opposite spindle poles during anaphase i at the end of meiosis ii two types of gametes have been produced half have r and half have r but no gametes have both alleles thus the separation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis i corresponds to the segregation of alleles as the punnett square shows fertilization of r and r eggs with the same proportion of r and r sperm leads to mendels ratio in the f generation one pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed shape alleles r and r a second pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed color alleles y and y each homologous pair aligns at random at the metaphase plate during meiosis i independently of the other homologous pair thus two equally likely configurations are possible for the migration of any two chromosome pairs toward the poles during anaphase i as a result a dihybrid individual will generate four equally likely types of gametes with regard to the two traits in question the punnett square affirms that independent assortment of traits carried by nonhomologous chromosomes produces mendels ratio what kind of polymorphism is most likely represented b with your answer to part a in mind determine the womans genotype at this locus indicate all nucleotides that can be read from both alleles and their to orientation c what kind of molecular event was likely to have generated this polymorphism d how would you know exactly where in the genome this locus is found e what is another way in which you could analyze the pcr products to genotype this locus f suppose you wanted to genotype this locus based on single molecule dna sequencing of whole genomes as shown in fig would a single read suffice for genotyping the locus by this alternative method answer to solve this problem you need to understand that pcr will simultaneously amplify both copies of a locus one on the maternally derived chromosome and one on the paternally derived chromosome as long as the primer can hybridize to both homologs as is usually the case the dna sequence trace has two nucleotides at several positions this fact indicates that the woman must be a heterozygote and that the pcr is amplifying both alleles of the locus a notice that both alleles contain multiple repeats of the dinucleotide ca the most likely explanation for the polymorphism is therefore that the locus contains an ssr polymorphism whose alleles have different numbers of ca repeats one allele has six repeats the second allele must have more ca units b writing out the first nucleotides of both alleles is straightforward if the assumption in part a is correct then one allele should have more than six ca repeats the trace shows evidence for two additional ca repeats in one allele at positions for a total of eight ca repeats you can then determine the nucleotides beyond the repeats in the shorter allele by subtracting caca from positions the remaining peaks at these positions correspond to atgt note that atgt can also be found in the longer allele but now at nucleotides just past the two additional caca repeats you can determine the last four nucleotides in the shorter allele by subtracting atgt from positions revealing tagg the sequences of the two alleles of this ssr locus indicating only one strand of dna each are thus allele ggcacacacacacaatgttagg allele ggcacacacacacacacaatgt c the mechanism thought to be responsible for most ssr polymorphisms is stuttering of dna polymerase during dna replication solving genetics problems the best way for students to assess and increase their understanding of genetics is to practice through problems found at the end of each chapter problem sets assist students in evaluating their grasp of key concepts and allow them to apply what they have learned to real life issues review problems problems are organized by chapter section and in order of increasing difficulty to help students develop strong problem solving skills the answers to select problems can be found in the back of this text solved problems solved problems offer step by step guidance needed to understand the problem solving process acknowledgements the creation of a project

genetics from genes to genomes justin wyatt and michelle vogler for their support mandy clark for her organizational skills and tireless work to tie up all loose ends and vicki krug and the entire production team for their careful attention to detail and ability to move the schedule along genetics the study of biological information information can be stored in many ways including the patterns of letters and words in books and the sequence of nucleotides in dna molecules genetics the science of heredity is at its core the study of biological information all living organisms from single celled bacteria and protozoa to multicellular plants and animals must store and use vast quantities of information to develop survive and reproduce in their environments fig geneticists examine how organisms use biological information during their lifetimes and pass it on to their progeny this book introduces you to the field of genetics as currently practiced in the early twenty first century several broad themes recur throughout this presentation first we know that biological information is encoded in dna and that the proteins responsible for an organisms many functions are built from this code second we have found that all living forms are related at the molecular level with the aid of high speed computers and other technologies we can now study genomes at the level of dna sequence these new methods have revealed that genomes have a modular construction that has allowed rapid evolution of complexity finally our focus in this book is on human genetics and the application of genetic discoveries to human problems figure the biological information in dna generates an enormous diversity of living organisms dna lifes fundamental information molecule learning objectives relate the structure of dna to its function differentiate between a chromosome dna a gene a base pair and a protein the process of evolution the change in traits of groups of organisms over time has taken close to billion years to generate the amazing mechanisms for storing replicating expressing and diversifying biological information seen in organisms now inhabiting the earth the linear dna molecule stores biological information in units known as nucleotides within each dna molecule the sequence of the four letters of the dna alphabet g c a and t specify which proteins an organism will make as well as when and where protein synthesis will occur the letters refer to the bases guanine cytosine adenine and thymine that are components of the nucleotide building blocks of dna the dna molecule itself is a double strand of nucleotides carrying complementary g c or a t base pairs fig these complementary base pairs bind together through hydrogen bonds the molecular complementarity of doublestranded dna is its most important property and the key to understanding how dna functions figure the biological information in dna generates an enormous diversity of living organisms a

humans figure complementary base pairs are a key feature of the dna molecule a single strand of dna is composed of nucleotide subunits each consisting of a deoxyribose sugar white pentagons a phosphate yellow circles and one of four nitrogenous bases adenine thymine cytosine or guanine designated as lavender or green as ts cs or gs hydrogen bonds dotted lines enable a to associate tightly with t and c to associate tightly with g thus the two strands are complementary to each other the arrows labeled to show that the strands have opposite orientations although the dna molecule is three dimensional most of its information is one dimensional and digital the information is one dimensional because it is encoded as a specific sequence of letters along the length of the molecule it is digital because each unit of information one of the four letters of the dna alphabet is discrete because genetic information is digital it can be stored as readily in a computer memory as in a dna molecule indeed the combined power of dna sequencers computers and dna synthesizers makes it possible to store interpret replicate and transmit genetic information electronically from one place to another anywhere on the planet the dna regions that encode proteins are called genes just as the limited number of letters in a written alphabet places no restrictions on the stories one can tell so too the limited number of letters in the genetic code alphabet places no restrictions on the kinds of proteins and thus the kinds of organisms genetic information can define within the cells of an organism dna molecules carrying the genes are assembled into chromosomes organized structures containing dna and proteins that package and manage the storage duplication expression and evolution of dna fig the dna within the entire collection of chromosomes in each cell of an organism is its genome human cells for example contain distinct kinds of chromosomes carrying approximately base pairs and roughly genes the amount of information that can be encoded in this size genome is equivalent to million pages of text containing words per page with each letter corresponding to one base pair to appreciate the long journey from a finite amount of genetic information easily storable on a computer disk to the production of a human being we next must examine proteins the primary molecules that determine how complex systems of cells tissues and organisms function essential concepts dna a double stranded macromolecule composed of four nucleotides is the repository of genetic information dna is organized into chromosomes of different types in humans that collectively constitute an organisms genome the human genome contains about genes most of which encode proteins proteins the functional molecules of life processes learning objectives compare the chemical structures of dna and proteins differentiate between the functions of dna and the functions of proteins although no single characteristic distinguishes living organisms from inanimate matter you would have little trouble deciding which entities in a group of objects are alive over time these living organisms governed by the laws of physics and chemistry as well as a genetic program would be able to reproduce themselves most of the organisms would also have an elaborate and complicated structure that would change over time sometimes drastically as when an insect larva metamorphoses into an adult yet another characteristic of life is the ability to move animals swim fly walk or run while plants grow toward or away from light still another characteristic is the capacity to adapt selectively to the environment finally a key characteristic of living organisms is the ability to use sources of energy and matter to grow that is the ability to convert foreign material into their own body parts the chemical and physical reactions that carry out these conversions are known as metabolism most properties of living organisms arise ultimately from the class of molecules known as proteins large polymers composed of hundreds to thousands of amino acid subunits strung together in long chains each chain folds into a specific three dimensional conformation dictated by the sequence of its amino acids fig most proteins are composed of different amino acids the information in the dna of genes dictates via a genetic code the order of amino acids in a protein molecule you can think of proteins as constructed from a set of different kinds of snap beads distinguished by color and shape if you were to arrange the beads in any order make strings of a thousand beads each and then fold or twist the chains into shapes dictated by the order of their beads you would be able to make a nearly infinite number of different three dimensional shapes the astonishing diversity of three dimensional protein structures generates the extraordinary diversity of protein functions that is the basis of each organisms complex and adaptive behavior fig b and c the structure and shape of the hemoglobin protein for example allow it to transport oxygen in the bloodstream and release it to the tissues in contrast lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that converts lactate to pyruvate an important step in producing cellular energy most of the properties associated with life emerge from the constellation of protein molecules that an organism synthesizes according to instructions contained in its dna essential concepts proteins are responsible for most biological functions of cells and organisms a protein is a macromolecule consisting of amino acids linked in a linear sequence the sequences of amino acids in proteins are encoded by genes within the dna figure proteins are polymers of amino acids that fold in three dimensions a structural formulas for two amino acids alanine and tyrosine all amino acids have a basic amino group nh green at one end and an acidic carboxyl group cooh blue at the other the specific side chain red determines the amino acids chemical properties b the amino acid sequences of two different human proteins the chain of hemoglobin green and the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase purple c the different amino acid sequences of these proteins dictate different threedimensional shapes the specific sequence of amino acids in a chain determines the precise three dimensional shape of the protein molecular similarities of all life forms learning objective summarize the molecular evidence for the common origin of living organisms the evolution of biological information is a fascinating story spanning the billion years of earths history many biologists think that rna was the first informationprocessing molecule to appear very similar to dna rna molecules are also composed of four subunits the bases g c a and u for uracil which replaces the t of dna like dna rna has the capacity to store replicate and express information like proteins rna can fold in three dimensions to produce molecules capable of catalyzing the chemistry of life in fact you will learn that the ultimate function of some genes is to encode rna molecules instead of proteins rna molecules however are intrinsically unstable thus it is probable that the more stable dna took over the linear information storage and replication functions of rna while proteins with their far greater capacity for diversity preempted in large part the functions derived from rnas three dimensional folding with this division of labor rna became primarily an intermediary in converting the information in dna into the sequence of amino acids in protein fig a the separation that placed information storage in dna and biological function mainly in proteins was so successful that all known organisms alive today descend from the first organisms that happened upon this molecular specialization the evidence for the common origin of all living forms is present in their dna sequences all living organisms use essentially the same genetic code in which various triplet groupings of the four letters of the dna and rna alphabets encode the letters of the amino acid alphabet fig b figure rna is an intermediary in the conversion of dna information into protein via the genetic code a the linear bases of dna are copied through molecular complementarity into the linear bases of rna the bases of rna are read three at a time that is as triplets to encode the amino acid subunits of proteins b the genetic code dictionary specifies the relationship between rna triplets and the amino acid subunits of proteins figure comparisons of gene products in different species provide evidence for the relatedness of living organisms this chart shows the amino acid sequence for equivalent portions of the cytochrome c protein in six species saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast arabidopsis thaliana a weedlike flowering plant caenorhabditis elegans a nematode drosophila melanogaster the fruit fly mus musculus the house mouse and homo sapiens humans consult fig b for the key to amino acid names the relatedness of all living organisms is also evident from comparisons of genes with similar functions in very different organisms a striking similarity exists between the genes for many corresponding proteins in bacteria yeast plants worms flies mice and humans for example most of the amino acids in the cytochrome c proteins of diverse species are identical to each other fig indicating that these proteins all derived from a common ancestral protein it is also important to note that some amino acids in these various cytochrome c proteins are different the reason is that different mutations that is changes in nucleotide pairs can occur when genes are passed from one generation of an organism to the next the accumulation of these mutations in genomes is the main driving force of evolution despite the occurrence of mutations that alter dna and thus protein sequences it is often possible to place a gene from one organism into the genome of a very different organism and see it function normally in the new environment human genes that help regulate cell division for example can replace related genes in yeast and enable the yeast cells to function normally one of the most striking examples of relatedness at this level of biological information was uncovered in studies of eye development both insects and vertebrates including humans have eyes but they are of very different types fig biologists had long assumed that the evolution of eyes occurred independently and in many evolution textbooks eyes were used as an example of convergent evolution in which structurally unrelated but functionally analogous organs emerge in different species as a result of natural selection studies of a gene called pax have turned this view upside down mutations in the pax gene lead to a failure of eye development in both people and mice and molecular studies have suggested that pax might play a central role in the initiation of eye development in all vertebrates remarkably when the human pax gene is expressed in cells along the surface of the fruit fly body it induces numerous little eyes to develop there it turns out that fruit flies also have a gene specifying a protein whose amino acid sequence is distantly but clearly related to that of the protein specified by human pax and furthermore certain mutations in the fly gene result in animals lacking eyes taken together these results demonstrate that during million years of divergent evolution an ancestral gene that served as the main control switch for initiating eye development accumulated different mutations in the lineages leading to people and fruit flies but the gene still serves the same function in both species the usefulness of the relatedness and unity at all levels of biological information cannot be overstated it means that in many cases the experimental manipulation of organisms known as model organisms can shed light on gene functions in humans if genes similar to human genes function in simple model organisms such as fruit flies or bacteria scientists can determine gene function and regulation in these experimentally manipulable organisms and bring these insights to an understanding of the human organism essential concepts living organisms exhibit marked similarities at the molecular level in the ways they use dna and rna to make proteins certain genes have persisted throughout the evolution of widely divergent species figure the eyes of insects and humans have a common ancestor a a fly eye and b a human eye figure how genes arise by duplication and divergence ancestral gene a contains exons green red and purple separated by introns in blue gene a is duplicated to create two copies that are originally identical but mutations in either or both other colors cause the copies to diverge additional rounds of duplication and divergence create a family of related genes the modular construction of genomes learning objectives describe mechanisms by which new genes could arise explain how regulation of gene expression can alter gene function we have seen that roughly genes direct human growth and development how did such complexity arise recent technical advances have enabled researchers to complete structural analyses of the entire genome of many organisms the information obtained reveals that gene families have arisen by duplication of a primordial gene after duplication mutations may cause the two copies to diverge from each other fig in both humans and chimpanzees for example four different genes produce different rhodopsin proteins that are expressed in photoreceptors of distinct retinal cells each of these proteins functions in a slightly different way so that four kinds of retinal cells respond to light of different wavelengths and intensities resulting in color vision the four rhodopsin genes arose from a single primordial gene by several duplications followed by slight divergences in structure duplication followed by divergence underlies the evolution of new genes with new functions this principle appears to have been built into the genome structure of all multicellular organisms the protein coding region of most genes is subdivided into as many as or more small pieces called exons separated by dna that does not code for protein called introns as shown in fig this modular construction facilitates the rearrangement of different modules from different genes to create new combinations during evolution it is likely that this process of modular reassortment facilitated the rapid diversification of living forms about million years ago see fig the tremendous advantage of the duplication and divergence of existing pieces of genetic information is evident in the history of lifes evolution table prokaryotic cells such as bacteria which do not have a membrane bounded nucleus evolved about billion years ago eukaryotic cells such as algae which have a membrane bounded nucleus emerged around billion years ago and multicellular eukaryotic organisms appeared million years ago then about million years ago within the relatively short evolutionary time of roughly million years known as the cambrian explosion the multicellular life forms diverged into a bewildering array of organisms including primitive vertebrates figure two winged and four winged flies geneticists converted a contemporary normal two winged fly to a four winged insect resembling the flys evolutionary antecedent they accomplished this by mutating a key element in the flys regulatory network note the club shaped halteres arrows behind the wings of the fly at the top both edward lewis california institute of technology a fascinating question is how could the multicellular forms achieve such enormous diversity in only million years the answer lies in part in the hierarchic organization of the information encoded in chromosomes exons are arranged into genes genes duplicate and diverge to generate gene families and gene families sometimes rapidly expand to gene superfamilies containing hundreds of related genes in both mouse and human adults for example the immune system is encoded by a gene superfamily composed of hundreds of closely related but slightly divergent genes with the emergence of each successively larger informational unit evolution gains the ability to duplicate increasingly complex informational modules through single genetic events probably even more important for the evolution of complexity is the rapid change of regulatory networks that specify how genes behave that is when where and to what degree they are expressed during development for example the two winged fly evolved from a four winged ancestor not because of changes in gene encoded structural proteins but rather because of a rewiring of the regulatory network which converted one pair of wings into two small balancing organs known as halteres fig essential concepts gene duplication followed by the divergence of copies is one explanation for how new functions evolve the reshuffling of exons in eukaryotes provides another mechanism for the rapid diversification of genomes changes in dna that affect gene regulation where when and to what degree genes are expressed also generate evolutionary change modern genetic techniques learning objectives explain how advances in technology have accelerated the analysis of genomes compare the knowledge obtained from genetic dissection and from genome sequencing discuss how genome sequence information can be used to treat or cure diseases the complexity of living systems has developed over billion years from the continuous amplification and refinement of genetic information the simplest bacterial cells contain about genes that interact in complex networks yeast cells the simplest eukaryotic cells contain about genes nematodes roundworms contain about genes and fruit flies contain roughly genes humans have approximately genes surprisingly the flowering plant arabidopsis has as many and the zebrafish d rerio has even more fig each of these organisms has provided valuable insights into aspects of biology that are conserved among all organisms as well as other phenomena that are species specific genetic dissection of model organisms reveals the working of biological processes model organisms including bacteria yeast nematodes fruit flies arabidopsis zebrafish and mice are extremely valuable to researchers who can use these organisms to analyze the complexity of a genome piece by piece the logic used in genetic dissection is quite simple inactivate a gene in a model organism and observe the consequences for example the loss of a gene for visual pigment produces fruit flies with white eyes instead of eyes of the normal red color one can thus conclude that the protein product of this gene plays a key role in eye pigmentation from their study of model organisms geneticists are amassing a detailed picture of the complexity of living systems whole genome sequencing can identify mutant genes that cause disease a complementary way to study an organisms genetic complexity is to look not just at one gene at a time but rather at the genome as a whole the new tools of genomics particularly high throughput dna sequencers have the capacity to analyze all the genes of any living thing in fact the complete nucleotide sequences of representative genomes of the model species listed above as well as of humans have all been determined the first draft of the human genome sequence announced by the human genome project in cost billion and took over years to produce since then rapid advances in genome sequencing technology have made it possible in to determine the genome sequence of an individual in just a few days for about alongside the advances in dna sequencing technology have been the development of computer algorithms to analyze the sequence data and the establishment of online databases that catalog the differences in individual genome sequences no example better illustrates the power of genome sequencing technology than its use in the identification of gene mutations that cause human genetic diseases for diseases that result from mutation of a single gene the gene responsible often may be identified by determining the genome sequence of just a few people or sometimes even that of a single individual in the case shown in fig a geneticists analyzed whole genome sequences to find a gene mutation underlying a rare brain malformation disease called microcephaly the inheritance pattern observed for microcephaly indicated that it is a so called recessive disease meaning that diseased people inherit two mutant gene copies one from each normal parent the parents have one normal gene copy and one mutant copy explaining why the parents brains do not have this malformation sequencing and analysis of the genomes of two children with microcephaly from the same family identified a single rare gene mutation present in both siblings a deletion of four base pairs within a gene called wdr fig b each parent was found to have one normal copy of wdr and one copy with the four base pair deletion fig b subsequently the researchers found that different families with microcephalic children harbored different mutations in the same gene fig c thus confirming wdr as a causative gene for microcephaly gene therapy may help cure genetic diseases by enabling rapid disease gene discovery the sequencing of whole genomes is revolutionizing medicine knowledge of disease genes can inform parents whether their children might suffer from a severely debilitating disease like microcephaly allowing the parents to consider ways in which to avoid or to prepare for such an outcome moreover identification of a disease gene provides information about the protein encoded by that gene that can sometimes guide the design of effective therapeutics to treat the disease this strategy has not yet been useful in the case of microcephaly but it has already been of tremendous value in developing drugs to combat other genetic diseases including certain kinds of cancer dramatic progress within the last few years offers hope that medical scientists may eventually be able to treat genetic diseases by modifying the genomes of the somatic body cells affected by the disease syndrome one method under development is called gene therapy here scientists introduce normal copies of genes into human cells where they can be expressed and compensate for their mutant nonfunctional counterparts in the genome an alternative very recent gene therapy approach is genome editing in which researchers change the base pair sequence of a mutant gene to that of its normal counterpart gene therapy and genome editing have been used in model organisms such as mice to restore proper gene function and sometimes reverse the disease process but the application of these techniques to human conditions is still only in very early stages figure seven model organisms whose genomes were sequenced as part of the human genome project the chart indicates genome size in millions of base pairs or megabases mb the bottom row shows the approximate number of genes for each organism figure a causal gene for microcephaly identified by genome

that causes a major change in the amino acid sequence of the protein product of the gene the letters above each triplet sequence identify the encoded amino acid c five different mutations in the wdr gene in five different families are shown four of the mutations affect the identity of a single amino acid in the protein encoded by the gene for example w s means that the th amino acid is normally w tryptophan but is changed to s serine by the mutation the arrow indicates the position of the tgcc deletion mutation shown in b scientists analyze mutations in model organisms to understand the molecular basis of many biological processes automated sequencing and computer analysis have made possible the rapid determination of dna sequences in genomes allowing researchers to pinpoint genes responsible for genetic diseases knowledge of disease genes helps parents make informed reproductive decisions allows pharmaceutical companies to design effective drugs and in the future will enable medical researchers to manipulate somatic cell genomes to reverse disease effects human genetics and society learning objectives describe the types of information that can be obtained from an individuals genome sequence discuss the social issues that arise from the availability of personal genome sequences over the next years geneticists will identify hundreds of genes with variations that predispose people to many types of disease cardiovascular cancerous immunological mental metabolic some mutations will always cause disease as in the microcephaly example just discussed others will only predispose to disease for example a change in a specific single dna base pair in the globin gene will nearly always cause sickle cell anemia a painful life threatening condition that leads to severe anemia by contrast a mutation in the breast cancer brca gene increases the risk of breast cancer to between and in a woman carrying one copy of the mutation this conditional state arises because the brca gene interacts with environmental factors that affect the probability of activating the cancerous condition and because various forms of other genes can modify the effect of the brca gene mutation physicians may be able to use dna diagnostics a collection of techniques for characterizing genes to analyze an individuals dna for genes that predispose to some diseases with this genetic profile doctors may be able to write out a predictive health history based on probabilities for some medical conditions many social issues need to be addressed although biological information is similar to other types of information from a strictly technical point of view it is as different as can be in its meaning and impact on individual human beings and on human society as a whole the difference lies in the personal nature of the unique genetic profile carried by each person from birth within the genome of each individual is complex information that provides greater or lower susceptibility or resistance to many diseases as well as greater or lesser potential for the expression of many physiological and neurological attributes that distinguish people from each other until now almost all of this information has remained hidden away but if research continues at its present pace in less than a decade it will become possible to understand many aspects of a persons genetic make up and with this information will come the power to make some limited predictions about future possibilities and risks as you will see in many of the genetics and society boxes throughout this book society can use genetic information not only to help people but also to restrict their lives for example by denying insurance or employment we believe that just as our society respects an individuals right to privacy in other realms it should also respect the privacy of an individuals genetic profile and work against all types of discrimination indeed in the united states federal government passed the genetic information nondiscrimination act prohibiting insurance companies and employers from discrimination on the basis of genetic tests another issue raised by the potential for detailed genetic profiles is the interpretation or misinterpretation of that information without accurate interpretation the information becomes useless at best and harmful at worst proper interpretation of genetic information requires some understanding of statistical concepts such as risk and probability as an example women found to have the brca mutation described above need to weigh the possible risks and benefits of preventive treatments such as mastectomy against the statistical probability that they would suffer otherwise from breast cancer to help people understand these concepts widespread education in this area will be essential to many people the most frightening potential of the new genetics is the development of gene therapy technologies that can alter or add to the genes present within the germ line reproductive cell precursors of human embryos in contrast with the previously described use of such genetic engineering to treat diseases in non inheritable somatic cells germ line cells that have been manipulated in these ways can be transmitted between generations and thus have the potential to influence the evolution of our species some people caution that developing the power to alter our own genomes is a step we should not take arguing that if genetic information and technology are misused as they certainly have been in the past the consequences could be horrific attempts to use genetic information for social purposes were prevalent in the early twentieth century leading to enforced sterilization of individuals thought to be inferior to laws that prohibited interracial marriage and to laws prohibiting immigration of certain ethnic groups the basis of these actions was not scientific and has been thoroughly discredited others agree that we must not repeat the mistakes of the past but they warn that if the new technologies could help children and adults lead healthier happier lives we cannot outlaw their application most agree that the biological revolution we are living through will have a greater impact on human society than any technological revolution of the past and that education and public debate are the key to preparing for the consequences of this revolution the focus on human genetics in this book looks forward into the new era of biology and genetic analysis these new possibilities raise serious moral and ethical issues that will demand wisdom and humility it is in the hope of educating young people for the moral and ethical challenges awaiting the next generation that we write this book essential concepts genome sequences may identify not only genes that always cause disease but also genes that predispose an individual to a disease as a society we must ensure that genetic knowledge is properly interpreted and that individuals privacy is protected genetics the study of biological information is also the study of the dna and rna molecules that store replicate transmit express and evolve information for the construction of proteins at the molecular level all living things are closely related and as a result observations of model organisms as different as yeast and mice can provide insights into general biological principles as well as human biology remarkably more than years before the discovery of dna gregor mendel an augustinian monk delineated the basic laws of gene transmission with no knowledge of the molecular basis of heredity he accomplished this by following simple traits such as flower or seed color through several generations of the pea plant pisum sativum we now know that his findings apply to all sexually reproducing organisms chapter describes mendels studies and insights which became the foundation of the field of genetics vocabulary choose the phrase from the right column that best fits the term in the left column a complementarity a linear polymer of amino acids that folds into a particular shape b nucleotide part of a gene that does

other macromolecules h performs chemical reactions a how many different dna strands composed of nucleotides could possibly exist b how many different proteins composed of amino acids could possibly exist section rna shares with proteins the ability to fold into complex three dimensional shapes as a result rna molecules can like protein molecules catalyze biochemical reactions that is both kinds of molecules can act as enzymes or biological catalysts these statements are not true of dna why can some rna molecules act as enzymes whereas dna molecules cannot hint most rna molecules consist of a single strand of nucleotides while most dna molecules are double helixes made of two strands of nucleotides the human protein lactate dehydrogenase shown in fig has amino acids what is the smallest possible combined size of the parts of the gene that specify this protein using the genetic code a are the triplets in the genetic code table shown in fig b written as dna or rna b two amino acids are each specified only by a single triplet identify these two amino acids and the corresponding triplets c if you know the sequence of amino acids in a protein what does the genetic code table allow you to infer about the sequence of base pairs in the gene that specifies that protein why do scientists think that all forms of life on earth have a common origin why would a geneticist study a yeast cell or a fruit fly or a mouse in order to understand human genes and human biology how can a scientist tell if a protein present in bacteria and a fruit fly protein have a common origin how can a scientist determine whether a protein with a common origin in bacteria and a fruit fly function in a common pathway figure shows the amino acid sequences of parts of the cytochrome c proteins from several different organisms some of these amino acids are highlighted in dark orange some in light orange and some are not highlighted at all which of these three classes of amino acids is likely to be most important for the biochemical function of cytochrome c proteins section why do scientists think that new genes arise by duplication of an original gene and divergence by mutation explain how the exon intron structure of genes contributes to the generation of new gene functions during evolution mutations in genes that change their pattern of expression the time and cell type in which the gene product is produced are thought to be a major factor in the evolution of different organisms would you expect the same protein to work in the same way for example to perform the same kind of enzymatic reaction in two different types of cells for example cells in the retina of the eye and muscle cells is it possible that the same protein might function in different biochemical pathways in eye cells and muscle cells even if the proteins basic mechanism always remains the same section a single zebrafish gene function was inactivated completely by mutation and a zebrafish with this mutation had none of its normal horizontal stripes for each of the following statements indicate whether the statement is certainly true certainly untrue or if there is insufficient information to decide a the normal gene function is required for the viability of the zebrafish b the normal gene function is required for the formation of stripes c the normal gene function is required to make the pigment deposited in the stripes d the gene is required in zebrafish only for stripe formation different mutations in the wdr gene that inactivate gene function were found in the genomes of many different people with microcephaly this information provided strong support for the idea that the wdr gene mutation causes microcephaly a the human genome sequence identified wdr as one of the approximately genes in the human genome what information about the function of wdr do you think was learned originally from the dna sequence of the normal human genome b what additional information was provided by identification of wdr as the microcephaly disease gene c the mouse genome contains a gene similar to human wdr experiments in mice have shown that the mouse wdr gene is expressed in the brain technology is now available that allows scientists to generate mice in which the two normal copies of the wdr gene are replaced with mutant copies of the gene that are nonfunctional why would a scientist want to generate such wdr mutant mice researchers have successfully used gene therapy to ameliorate some human genetic diseases by adding a normal gene copy to cells whose genomes originally had only nonfunctional mutant copies of that gene for example a form of blindness due to the lack of a single protein called rpe has been reversed by introduction of a normal rpe gene to cells of the retina of adults a the success of this gene therapy approach provides us with clues about the role of the rpe protein in the retina do you think that rpe is needed for the proper development of the human eye b can you see a potential difficulty in applying this gene therapy approach for diseases like microcephaly section by the time this book is published it will likely be possible for you to obtain the sequence of your genome at nominal cost do you want this information explain the factors that affected your decision you may not be able to answer this question until you are finished reading this book mendels principles of heredity although mendels laws can predict the probability that an individual will have a certain genetic makeup the chance meeting of particular male and female gametes determines an individuals actual genetic fate lawrence manning corbis a quick glance at an extended family portrait is likely to reveal children who resemble one parent or the other or who look like a combination of the two fig some children however look unlike any of the assembled relatives and more like a great great grandparent what causes the similarities and differences of appearance and the skipping of generations the answers lie in our genes the basic units of biological information and in heredity the way genes transmit physiological anatomical and behavioral traits from parents to offspring each of us starts out as a single fertilized egg cell that develops by division and differentiation into a mature adult made up of a hundred trillion specialized cells capable of carrying out all the bodys functions and controlling our outward appearance genes passed from one generation to the next underlie the formation of every heritable trait such traits are as diverse as the presence of a cleft in your chin the tendency to lose hair as you age your hair eye and skin color and even your susceptibility to certain cancers all such traits run in families in predictable patterns that impose some possibilities and exclude others genetics the science of heredity pursues a precise explanation of the biological structures and mechanisms that determine inheritance in some instances the relationship between gene and trait is remarkably simple a single change in a single gene for example results in sickle cell anemia a disease in which the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells is defective in other instances the correlations between genes and traits are bewilderingly complex an example is the genetic basis of facial features in which many genes determine a large number of molecules that interact to generate the combination we recognize as a friends face gregor mendel fig a stocky bespectacled augustinian monk and expert plant breeder discovered the basic principles of genetics in the mid nineteenth century he published his findings in just seven years after darwins on the origin of species appeared in print mendel lived and worked in br nn austria now brno in the czech republic where he examined the inheritance of clear cut alternative traits in pea plants such as purple versus white flowers or yellow versus green seeds in so doing he inferred genetic laws that allowed him to make verifiable predictions about which traits would appear disappear and then reappear and in which generations mendels laws are based on the hypothesis that observable traits are determined by independent units of inheritance not visible to the naked eye we now call these units genes the concept of the gene continues to change as research deepens and refines our understanding today a gene is recognized as a region of dna that encodes a specific protein or a particular type of rna in the beginning however it was an abstraction an imagined particle with no physical features the function of which was to control a visible trait by an unknown mechanism we begin our study of genetics with a detailed look at what mendels laws are and how they were discovered in subsequent chapters we discuss logical extensions to these laws and describe how mendels successors grounded the abstract concept of hereditary units genes in an actual biological molecule dna four general themes emerge from our detailed discussion of mendels work the first is that variation as expressed in alternative forms of a trait is widespread in nature this genetic diversity provides the raw material for the continuously evolving variety of life we see around us second observable variation is essential for following genes from one generation to the next third variation is not distributed solely by chance rather it is inherited according to genetic laws that explain why like begets both like and unlike dogs beget other dogs but hundreds of breeds of dogs are known even within a breed such as labrador retrievers genetic variation exists two black dogs could have a litter of black chocolate brown and yellow puppies fig mendels insights help explain why this is so fourth the laws mendel discovered about heredity apply equally well to all sexually reproducing organisms from protozoans to peas to dogs to people figure a family portrait the extended family shown here includes members of four generations bruce ayres getty images figure gregor mendel photographed around holding one of his experimental plants science source figure like begets like and unlike a labrador retriever with her litter of pups saudjie cross siino weathertop labradors the puzzle of inheritance learning objectives relate how mendels experimental approach is similar to the process of modern scientific inquiry describe how mendel cross fertilized and self fertilized pea plants explain the importance of mendels inclusion of reciprocal crosses within his controlled breeding program of pea plants predict the type of progeny produced by mendels crosses between pure breeding plants with discrete antagonistic traits such as purple versus white flowers several steps lead to an understanding of genetic phenomena the careful observation over time of groups of organisms such as human families herds of cattle or fields of corn or tomatoes the rigorous analysis of systematically recorded information gleaned from these observations and the development of a theoretical framework that can explain the origins and relationships of these phenomena in the mid nineteenth century gregor mendel became the first person to combine data collection analysis and theory in a successful pursuit of the true basis of heredity for many thousands of years before that the only genetic practice was the selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals with no guarantee of what a particular mating would produce artificial selection was the first applied genetic technique a rudimentary use of genetics was the driving force behind a key transition in human civilization allowing hunters and gatherers to settle in villages and survive as shepherds and farmers even before recorded history people practiced applied genetics as they domesticated plants and animals for their own uses from a large litter of semitamed wolves for example they sent the savage and the misbehaving to the stew pot while sparing the alert sentries and friendly companions for longer life and eventual mating as a result of this artificial selection purposeful control over mating by choice of parents for the next generation the domestic dog canis lupus familiaris slowly arose from ancestral wolves canis lupus the oldest bones identified indisputably as dog and not wolf are a skull excavated from a year old alaskan settlement many millennia of evolution guided by artificial selection have produced massive great danes and minuscule chihuahuas as well as hundreds of other modern breeds of dog by years ago people had begun to use this same kind of genetic manipulation to develop economically valuable herds of reindeer sheep goats pigs and cattle that produced lifesustaining meat milk hides and wools farmers also carried out artificial selection of plants storing seed from the hardiest and tastiest individuals for the next planting eventually obtaining strains that grew better produced more and were easier to cultivate and harvest in this way scrawny weed like plants gradually with human guidance turned into rice wheat barley lentils and dates in asia corn squash tomatoes potatoes and peppers in the americas yams peanuts and gourds in africa later plant breeders recognized male and female organs in plants and carried out artificial pollination an assyrian frieze carved in the ninth century b c pictured in fig is the oldest known visual record of this kind of genetic experiment it depicts priests brushing the flowers of female date palms with selected male pollen by this method of artificial selection early practical geneticists produced several hundred varieties of dates each differing in specific observable qualities such as the fruits size color or taste a botanical survey of three oases in egypt turned up varieties of date bearing palms twentieth century evidence of the natural and artificially generated variation among these trees figure the earliest known record of applied genetics in this year old assyrian relief from the northwest palace of assurnasirpal ii b c priests wearing bird masks artificially pollinate flowers of female date palms image copyright the metropolitan museum of art image source art resource ny desirable traits sometimes disappear and reappear in the year of mendels birth what people in austria understood about the basic principles of heredity was not much different from what the people of ancient assyria had known by the nineteenth century plant and animal breeders had created many strains in which offspring often carried a prized parental trait using such strains breeders could produce plants or animals with desired characteristics for food and fiber but they could not always predict why a valued trait would sometimes disappear and then reappear in only some offspring for example selective breeding practices had resulted in valuable flocks of merino sheep producing large quantities of soft fine wool but at the annual meeting of the moravian sheep breeders society one breeders dilemma epitomized the state of the art he possessed an outstanding ram that would be priceless if its advantages are inherited by its offspring but if they are not inherited then it is worth no more than the cost of wool meat and skin which would it be according to the meetings recorded minutes current breeding practices offered no definite answers in his concluding remarks at this sheep breeders meeting the abbot cyril napp pointed to a possible way out he proposed that breeders could improve their ability to predict what traits would appear in the offspring by finding the answers to three basic questions what is inherited how is it inherited what is the role of chance in heredity this quandary is where matters stood in when year old gregor mendel entered the monastery in br nn presided over by the same abbot napp although mendel was a monk trained in theology he was not a rank amateur in science the province of moravia in which br nn was located was a center of learning and scientific activity mendel was able to acquire a copy of darwins on the origin of species shortly after it was translated into german in abbot napp recognizing mendels intellectual abilities sent him to the university of vienna all expenses paid where he prescribed his own course of study mendels choices were an unusual mix physics mathematics chemistry botany paleontology and plant physiology christian doppler discoverer of the doppler effect was one of his teachers the cross pollination of ideas from several disciplines would play a significant role in mendels discoveries one year after he returned to br nn he began his series of seminal genetic experiments figure shows where mendel worked and the microscope he used mendel devised a new experimental approach before mendel many misconceptions clouded peoples thinking about heredity two of the prevailing errors were particularly misleading the first was that one parent contributes most to an offsprings inherited features nicolaas hartsoeker one of the earliest microscopists contended in that it was the male by way of a fully formed homunculus inside the sperm fig another deceptive notion was the concept of blended inheritance the idea that parental traits become mixed and forever changed in the offspring as when blue and yellow pigments merge to green on a painters palette the theory of blending may have grown out of a natural tendency for parents to see a combination of their own traits in their offspring while blending could account for children who look like a combination of their parents it could not explain obvious differences between biological brothers and sisters nor the persistence of variation within extended families the experiments mendel devised would lay these myths to rest by providing precise verifiable answers to the three questions abbot napp had raised almost years earlier what is inherited how is it inherited what is the role of chance in heredity a key component of mendels breakthrough was the way he set up his experiments what did mendel do differently from those who preceded him first he chose the garden pea pisum sativum as his experimental organism figs a and b peas grew well in br nn and with male and female organs in the same flower they were normally self fertilizing in self fertilization or selfing both egg and pollen come from the same plant the particular anatomy of pea flowers however makes it easy to prevent self fertilization and instead to cross fertilize or cross two individuals by brushing pollen from one plant onto a female organ of another plant as illustrated in fig c peas offered yet another advantage for each successive generation mendel could obtain large numbers of individuals within a relatively short growing season by comparison if he had worked with sheep each mating would have generated only a few offspring and the time between generations would have been several years second mendel examined the inheritance of clear cut alternative forms of particular traits purple versus white flowers yellow versus green peas using such either or traits he could distinguish and trace unambiguously the transmission of one or the other observed characteristic because no intermediate forms existed the opposite of these so called discrete traits are continuous traits such as height and skin color in humans continuous traits show many intermediate forms third mendel collected and perpetuated lines of peas that bred true matings within such pure breeding or true breeding lines produce offspring carrying specific parental traits that remain constant from generation to generation these lines are also called inbred because they have been mated only to each other for many generations mendel observed his pure breeding lines for up to eight generations plants with white flowers always produced offspring with white flowers plants with purple flowers produced only offspring with purple flowers mendel called constant but mutually exclusive alternative traits such as purple versus white flowers or yellow versus green seeds antagonistic pairs and he settled on seven such pairs for his study fig in his experiments mendel not only perpetuated pure breeding stocks for each member of a pair but he also cross fertilized pairs of plants to produce hybrids offspring of genetically dissimilar parents for each pair of antagonistic traits figure shows the appearance of the hybrids he studied fourth being an expert plant breeder mendel carefully controlled his matings going to great lengths to ensure that the progeny he observed really resulted from the specific fertilizations he intended thus mendel painstakingly prevented the intrusion of any foreign pollen and assured self or cross pollination as the experiment demanded not only did this allow him to carry out controlled breedings of selected traits but he could also make reciprocal crosses in such crosses he reversed the traits of the male and female parents thus controlling whether a particular trait was transmitted via the egg cell within the ovule or via a sperm cell within the pollen for example he could use pollen from a purple flower to fertilize the eggs of a white flower and also use pollen from a white flower to fertilize the eggs of a purple flower because the progeny of these reciprocal crosses were similar mendel demonstrated that the two parents contribute equally to inheritance it is immaterial to the form of the hybrid he wrote which of the parental types was the seed or pollen plant fifth mendel worked with large numbers of plants counted all offspring subjected his findings to numerical analysis and then compared his results with predictions based on his models he was the first person to study inheritance in this manner and no doubt his background in physics and mathematics contributed to this quantitative approach mendels careful numerical analysis revealed patterns of transmission that reflected basic laws of heredity finally mendel was a brilliant practical experimentalist when comparing tall and short plants for example he made sure that the short ones were out of the shade of the tall ones so their growth would not be stunted eventually he focused on certain traits of the pea seeds themselves such as their color or shape rather than on traits of the plants arising from the seeds in this way he could observe many more individuals from the limited space of the monastery garden and he could evaluate the results of a cross in a single growing season in short mendel purposely set up a simplified blackand white experimental system and then figured out how it worked he did not look at the vast number of variables that determine the development of a prize ram nor at the origin of differences between species rather he looked at discrete traits that came in two mutually exclusive forms and asked questions that could be answered by observation and computation people practiced artificial selection of crop plants and domestic animals for thousands of years without understanding how heredity works mendel established pure breeding lines of peas in which a specific characteristic would remain constant from one generation to the next when mendel crossed pure breeding lines with alternative traits the hybrid progeny always had the characteristics of one parent in mendels experiments the hybrid progeny produced by reciprocal cross fertilizations had the same characteristics it did not matter which parent was male and which was female figure mendels garden and microscope a gregor mendels garden was part of his monasterys property in br nn b mendel

predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratios among progeny of complex multihybrid crosses using simple rules of probability cite the most common molecular explanations for dominant and recessive alleles in early at the age of gregor mendel presented a paper entitled experiments on plant hybrids before the natural science society of br nn despite its modest heading this was a scientific paper of uncommon clarity and simplicity that summarized a decade of original observations and experiments in it mendel describes in detail the transmission of visible characteristics in pea plants defines unseen but logically deduced units genes that determine when and how often these visible traits appear and analyzes the behavior of genes in simple mathematical terms to reveal previously unsuspected principles of heredity published the following year the paper would eventually become the cornerstone of modern genetics its stated purpose was to see whether there is a generally applicable law governing the formation and development of hybrids let us examine its insights monohybrid crosses reveal the law of segregation once mendel had isolated pure breeding lines for several sets of characteristics he carried out a series of matings between individuals that differed in only one trait such as seed color or stem length in each cross one parent carries one form of the trait and the other parent carries an alternative form of the same trait figure illustrates one such mating early in the spring of for example mendel planted pure breeding green peas and pure breeding yellow peas and allowed them to grow into the parental p generation later that spring when the plants had flowered he dusted the female stigma of green pea plant flowers with pollen from yellow pea plants he also performed the reciprocal cross dusting yellow pea plant stigmas with greenpea pollen in the fall when he collected and separately analyzed the progeny peas of these reciprocal crosses he found that in both cases the peas were all yellow these yellow peas progeny of the p generation were the beginning of what we now call the first filial f generation to learn whether the green trait had disappeared entirely or remained intact but hidden in these f yellow peas mendel planted them to obtain mature f plants that he allowed to self fertilize such experiments involving hybrids for a single trait are often called monohybrid crosses he then harvested and counted the peas of the resulting second filial f generation progeny of the f generation among the progeny of one series of f self fertilizations there were yellow and green f peas an almost perfect ratio of yellow green f plants derived from the reciprocal of the original cross produced a similar ratio of yellow to green f progeny reappearance of the recessive trait the presence of green peas in the f generation was irrefutable evidence that blending had not occurred if it had the information necessary to make green peas would have been lost irretrievably in the f hybrids instead the information remained intact and was able to direct the formation of green peas actually harvested from the second filial generation these green peas were indistinguishable from their green grandparents mendel concluded that two types of yellow peas must exist those that breed true like the yellow peas of the p generation and those that can yield some green offspring like the yellow f hybrids this second type somehow contains latent information for green peas he called the trait that appeared in all the f hybrids in this case yellow seeds dominant see fig and the antagonistic green pea trait that remained hidden in the f hybrids but reappeared in the f generation recessive but how did he explain the ratio of yellow to green f peas genes discrete units of inheritance to account for his observations mendel proposed that for each trait every plant carries two copies of a unit of inheritance receiving one from its maternal parent and the other from the paternal parent today we call these units of inheritance genes each unit determines the appearance of a specific characteristic the pea plants in mendels collection had two copies of a gene for seed color two copies of another for seed shape two copies of a third for stem length and so forth mendel further proposed that each gene comes in alternative forms and combinations of these alternative forms determine the contrasting characteristics he was studying today we call the alternative forms of a single gene alleles the gene for pea color for example has yellow and green alleles the gene for pea shape has round and wrinkled alleles in mendels monohybrid crosses one allele of each gene was dominant the other recessive in the p generation one parent carried two dominant alleles for the trait under consideration the other parent two recessive alleles the f generation hybrids carried one dominant and one recessive allele for the trait individuals having two different alleles for a single trait are monohybrids the law of segregation if a plant has two copies of every gene how does it pass only one copy of each to its progeny and how do the offspring then end up with two copies of these same genes one from each parent mendel drew on his background in plant physiology and answered these questions in terms of the two biological mechanisms behind reproduction gamete formation and the random union of gametes at fertilization gametes are the specialized cells eggs within the ovules of the female parent and sperm cells within the pollen grains that carry genes between generations mendel imagined that during the formation of eggs and sperm the two copies of each gene in the parent separate or segregate so that each gamete receives only one allele for each trait fig a thus each egg and each sperm receives only one allele for pea color either yellow or green at fertilization a sperm with one or the other allele unites at random with an egg carrying one or the other allele restoring the two copies of the gene for each trait in the fertilized egg or zygote fig b if the sperm carries yellow and the egg green the result will be a hybrid yellow pea like the f monohybrids that resulted when pure breeding parents of opposite types mated if the yellow carrying sperm unites with a yellow carrying egg the result will be a yellow pea that grows into a pure breeding plant like those of the p generation that produced only yellow peas and finally if sperm carrying the allele for green peas fertilizes a green carrying egg the progeny will be a pure breeding green pea mendels law of segregation encapsulates this general principle of heredity the two alleles for each trait separate segregate during gamete formation and then unite at random one from each parent at fertilization throughout this book the term segregation refers to such equal segregation in which one allele and only one allele of each gene goes to each gamete note that the law of segregation makes a clear distinction between the somatic cells body cells of an organism which have two copies of each gene and the gametes which bear only a single copy of each gene the punnett square figure shows a simple way of visualizing the results of the segregation and random union of alleles during gamete formation and fertilization mendel invented a system of symbols that allowed him to analyze all his crosses in the same way he designated dominant alleles with a capital a b or c and recessive ones with a lowercase a b or c modern geneticists have adopted this convention for naming genes in peas and many other organisms but they often choose a symbol with some reference to the trait in question a y for yellow or an r for round throughout this book we present gene symbols in italics in fig we denote the dominant yellow allele with a capital y and the recessive green allele with a lowercase y the pure breeding plants of the parental generation are either yy yellow peas or yy green peas the yy parent can produce only y gametes the yy parent only y gametes you can see in fig why every cross between yy and yy produces exactly the same result a yy hybrid no matter which parent male or female contributes which particular allele next to visualize what happens when the yy hybrids self fertilize we set up a punnett square named after the british mathematician reginald punnett who introduced it in fig the square provides a simple and convenient method for tracking the kinds of gametes produced as well as all the possible combinations that might occur at fertilization as the punnett square shows in the first column and the first row each hybrid produces two kinds of gametes y and y in a ratio of thus half the sperm and half the eggs carry y the other half of each gamete type carries y each box in the punnett square in fig containing a colored pea represents one possible fertilization event at fertilization of the progeny will be yy yy yy and yy because the gametic source of an allele egg or sperm for the traits mendel studied had no influence on the alleles effect yy and yy are equivalent this means that of the progeny are yellow yy hybrids yy true breeding yellows and true breeding yy greens the diagram illustrates how the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the random union of egg and sperm at fertilization can produce the ratio of yellow to green that mendel observed in the f generation mendels results reflect basic rules of probability though you may not have realized it the punnett square illustrates two simple rules of probability the product rule and the sum rule that are central to the analysis of genetic crosses these rules predict the likelihood that a particular combination of events will occur the product rule the product rule states that the probability of two or more independent events occurring together is the product of the probabilities that each event will occur by itself with independent events probability of event and event probability of event probability of event consecutive coin tosses are obviously independent events a heads in one toss neither increases nor decreases the probability of a heads in the next toss if you toss two coins at the same time the results are also independent events a heads for one coin neither increases nor decreases the probability of a heads for the other coin thus the probability of a given combination is the product of their independent probabilities for example the probability that both coins will turn up heads is similarly the formation of egg and sperm are independent events in a hybrid plant the probability is that a given gamete will carry y and that it will carry y because fertilization happens at random the probability that a particular combination of maternal and paternal alleles will occur simultaneously in the same zygote is the product of the independent probabilities of these alleles being packaged in egg and sperm thus to find the chance of a y egg formed as the result of one event uniting with a y sperm the result of an independent event you simply multiply to get this is the same fraction of yy progeny seen in the punnett square of fig which demonstrates that the punnett square is simply another way of depicting the product rule it is important to realize that each box in the punnett square represents an equally likely outcome of the cross an equally likely fertilization event only because each of the two types of sperm and eggs y and y are produced at equal frequencies the sum rule while we can describe the moment of random fertilization as the simultaneous occurrence of two independent events we can also say that two different fertilization events are mutually exclusive for instance if y combines with y it cannot also combine with y in the same zygote a second rule of probability the sum rule states that the probability of either of two such mutually exclusive events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities with mutually exclusive events probability of event or event probability of event probability of event to find the likelihood that an offspring of a yy hybrid self fertilization will be a hybrid like the parents you add the probability of maternal y uniting with paternal y and the probability of the mutually exclusive event where paternal y unites with maternal y to get again the same result as in the punnett square in another use of the sum rule you could predict the ratio of yellow to green f progeny the fraction of f peas that will be yellow is the sum of the event producing yy plus the mutually exclusive event generating yy plus the mutually exclusive event producing yy to get the remaining of the f progeny will be green so the yellow to green ratio is to or more simply analyzing a monohybrid cross cross pollination of pure breeding parental plants produces f hybrids all of which resemble one of the parents self pollination of f plants gives rise to an f generation with a ratio of individuals resembling the two original parental types for simplicity we do not show the plants that produce the peas or that grow from the planted peas generation yellow peas green peas all yellow self fertilization yellow green the law of segregation a the two identical alleles of pure breeding plants separate segregate during gamete formation as a result each sperm or egg carries only one of each pair of parental alleles b cross pollination and fertilization between pure breeding parents with antagonistic traits result in f hybrid zygotes with two different alleles for the seed color gene a yy hybrid zygote will develop into a yellow pea the two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation yy yellow pea from a pure breeding stock grows into plant gamete formation grows into plant gamete formation gametes sperm or eggs yy green pea from a pure breeding stock two gametes one from each parent unite at random at fertilization gametes one sperm one egg zygote f hybrid fertilization seed development yellow pea showing dominant trait yellow determining allele of pea color gene green determining allele of pea color gene figure the punnett square visual summary of a cross this punnett square illustrates the combinations that can arise when an f hybrid undergoes gamete formation and self fertilization the f generation should have a ratio of yellow to green peas gametes f all identical y yy f yy yy y y yy y eggs sperm each box figure yellow f peas are of two types pure breeding and hybrid the distribution of a pair of contrasting alleles y and y after two generations of self fertilization the homozygous individuals of each generation breed true whereas the hybrids do not selffertilization selffertilization further crosses verify the law of segregation the law of segregation was a hypothesis that explained the data from simple crosses involving monohybrid peas but mendel needed to perform additional experiments to check its validity mendels hypothesis summarized in fig made the testable prediction that the f should have two kinds of yellow peas yy and yy but only one kind of green pea yy in addition his hypothesis predicted that the yy and yy yellow peas in the f should be present in a ratio of yy yy to verify these expectations mendel allowed selffertilization of all the plants in the f generation and counted the types of f progeny fig he found that the plants that developed from f green peas all produced only green peas in the f and when the resulting f plants self fertilized the next generation the f also produced green peas not shown this is what we and mendel would expect of pure breeding yy lines carrying two copies of the recessive allele the yellow peas were a different story when mendel allowed f plants that developed from yellow peas to self fertilize he observed that roughly of the total were pure breeding yellow through several generations but the other of the total yellow f plants were hybrids because they gave rise to yellow and green f peas in a ratio of therefore as mendels theory anticipated the ratio of yy to yy among the f yellow pea plants was indeed it took mendel years to conduct such rigorous experiments on seven pairs of pea traits but in the end he was able to conclude that the segregation of dominant and recessive alleles during gamete formation and their random union at fertilization could indeed explain the ratios he observed whenever he allowed hybrids to self fertilize his results however raised yet another question one of some importance to future plant and animal breeders plants showing a dominant trait such as yellow peas can be either pure breeding yy or hybrid yy how can you distinguish one from the other for self fertilizing plants the answer is to observe the appearance of the next generation but how would you distinguish pure breeding from hybrid individuals in species that do not self fertilize figure genotype versus phenotype in homozygotes and heterozygotes the relationship between genotype and phenotype with a pair of contrasting alleles where one allele y shows complete dominance over the other y genotype for the seed color gene phenotype yellow yellow green homozygous dominant heterozygous homozygous recessive dominant allele recessive allele cross a cross b o spring all yellow o spring yellow to green figure how a testcross reveals genotype an individual of unknown genotype but dominant phenotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive if the unknown genotype is homozygous all progeny will exhibit the dominant phenotype cross a if the unknown genotype is heterozygous half the progeny will exhibit the dominant trait half the recessive trait cross b testcrosses a way to establish genotype before describing mendels answer we need to define a few more terms an observable characteristic such as yellow or green pea seeds is a phenotype while the actual pair of alleles present in an individual is its genotype a yy or a yy genotype is called homozygous because the two copies of the gene that determine the particular trait in question are the same in contrast a genotype with two different alleles for a trait is heterozygous in other words it is a hybrid for that trait fig an individual with a homozygous genotype is a homozygote one with a heterozygous genotype is a heterozygote note that the phenotype of a heterozygote that is of a hybrid defines which allele is dominant because yy peas are yellow the yellow allele y is dominant to the y allele for green if you know the genotype and the dominance relation of the alleles you can accurately predict the phenotype the reverse is not true however because some phenotypes can derive from more than one genotype for example the phenotype of yellow peas can result from either the yy or the yy genotype with these distinctions in mind we can look at the method mendel devised for deciphering the unknown genotype well call it y responsible for a dominant phenotype the dash represents the unknown second allele either y or y this method called the testcross is a mating in which an individual showing the dominant phenotype for instance a y plant grown from a yellow pea is crossed with an individual expressing the recessive phenotype in this case a yy plant grown from a green pea as the punnett squares in fig illustrate if the dominant phenotype in question derives from a homozygous yy genotype all the offspring of the testcross will show the dominant yellow phenotype but if the dominant parent of unknown genotype is a heterozygous hybrid yy half of the progeny are expected to be yellow peas and the other half green in this way the testcross establishes the genotype behind a dominant phenotype resolving any uncertainty as we mentioned earlier mendel deliberately simplified the problem of heredity focusing on traits that come in only two forms he was able to replicate his basic monohybrid findings with corn beans and four oclocks plants with tubular white or bright red flowers as it turns out his concept of the gene and his law of segregation can be generalized to almost all sexually reproducing organisms dihybrid crosses reveal the law of independent assortment having determined from monohybrid crosses that genes are inherited according to the law of segregation mendel turned his attention to the simultaneous inheritance of two or more apparently unrelated traits in peas he asked how two pairs of alleles would segregate in a dihybrid individual that is in a plant that is heterozygous for two genes at the same time to construct such a dihybrid mendel mated truebreeding plants grown from yellow round peas yy rr with true breeding plants grown from green wrinkled peas yy rr from this cross he obtained a dihybrid f generation yy rr showing the two dominant phenotypes yellow and round fig he then allowed these f dihybrids to self fertilize to produce the f generation mendel could not predict the outcome of this mating would all the f progeny be parental types that looked like either the original yellow round parent or the green wrinkled parent or would some new combinations of phenotypes occur that were not seen in the parental lines such as yellow wrinkled or green round peas new phenotypic combinations like these are called recombinant types figure a dihybrid cross produces parental types and recombinant types in this dihybrid cross pure breeding parents p produce a genetically uniform generation of f dihybrids self pollination or cross pollination of the f plants yields the characteristic f phenotypic ratio of parental recombinant recombinant parental y r yy r y rr yy rr yellow round green round yellow wrinkled green wrinkled number phenotypic ratio of yellow dominant to green recessive or ratio of round dominant to wrinkled recessive or when mendel counted the f generation of one experiment he found yellow round peas green round yellow wrinkled and green wrinkled both yellow wrinkled and green round recombinant phenotypes did in fact appear providing evidence that some shuffling of the alleles of different genes had taken place the law of independent assortment from the observed ratios mendel inferred the biological mechanism of that shuffling the independent assortment of gene pairs during gamete formation because the genes for pea color and for pea shape assort independently the allele for pea shape in a gamete carrying y could with equal likelihood be either r or r thus the presence of a particular allele of one gene say the dominant y for pea color provides no information whatsoever about the allele of the second gene each dihybrid of the f generation can therefore make four kinds of gametes y r y r y r and y r in a large number of gametes the four kinds will appear in an almost perfect ratio of or put another way roughly of the eggs and of the sperm will contain each of the four possible combinations of alleles that the different kinds of germinal cells eggs or sperm of a hybrid are produced on the average in equal numbers was yet another one of mendels incisive insights at fertilization then in a mating of dihybrids different kinds of eggs can each combine with any of different kinds of sperm producing a total of possible zygotes once again a punnett square is a convenient way to visualize the process fig using the same kind of logic previously applied to the punnett square for monohybrid crosses review fig each of the boxes with colored peas in the punnett square for the dihybrid cross in fig represents an equally likely fertilization event again each box is an equally likely outcome only because each of the different gamete types is produced at equal frequency in each parent therefore using the product rule the frequency of the progeny type in each box is if you look at the square in fig you will see that some of the potential allelic combinations are identical in fact only nine different genotypes exist yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr and yy rr because the source of the alleles egg or sperm does not make any difference if you look at the combinations of traits determined by the nine genotypes you will see only four phenotypes yellow round green round yellow wrinkled and green wrinkled in a ratio of if however you look only at pea color or only at pea shape you can see that each trait is inherited in the ratio predicted by mendels law of segregation in the punnett square there are yellow for every green and round for every wrinkled in other words the ratio of each dominant trait yellow or round to its antagonistic recessive trait green or wrinkled is or this means that the inheritance of the gene for pea color is unaffected by the inheritance of the gene for pea shape and vice versa the preceding analysis became the basis of mendels second general genetic principle the law of independent assortment during gamete formation different pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other fig the independence of their segregation and the subsequent random union of gametes at fertilization determine the phenotypes observed using the product rule for assessing the probability of independent events you can see mathematically how the phenotypic ratio observed in a dihybrid cross derives from two separate phenotypic ratios if the two sets of alleles assort independently the yellow to green ratio in the f generation will be and likewise the round towrinkled ratio will be to find the probability that two independent events such as yellow and round will occur simultaneously in the same plant you multiply as follows probability of yellow round probability of green round probability of yellow wrinkled probability of green wrinkled thus in a population of f plants there will be a phenotypic ratio of yellow round to green round to yellow wrinkled to green wrinkled branched line diagrams a convenient way to keep track of the probabilities of each potential outcome in a genetic cross is to construct a branched line diagram fig which shows all the possible genotypes or phenotypes for each gene in a sequence of columns in fig the first column shows the two possible pea color phenotypes the second column demonstrates that each pea color can occur with either of two pea shapes again the ratio of phenotypes is apparent you will see later that branched line diagrams are more convenient than punnett squares for predicting the outcomes of crosses involving more than two genes alleles in parental cell gamete formation possible allele combinations in gametes figure the law of independent assortment in a dihybrid cross each pair of alleles assorts independently during gamete formation in the gametes y is equally likely to be found with r or r that is y r y r the same is true for y that is y r y r as a result all four possible types of gametes y r y r y r and y r are produced in equal frequency among a large population gene yellow green round round wrinkled gene phenotypes wrinkled yellow round green round yellow wrinkled green wrinkled figure following crosses with branched line diagrams a branched line diagram which uses a series of columns to track every gene in a cross provides an organized overview of all possible outcomes this branched line diagram of a dihybrid cross generates the same phenotypic ratios as the punnett square in fig showing that the two methods are equivalent figure testcrosses with dihybrids testcrosses involving two pairs of independently assorting alleles yield different predictable results depending on the tested individuals genotype for the two genes in question testcrosses with dihybrids an understanding of dihybrid crosses has many applications suppose for example that you work for a nursery that has three pure breeding strains yellow wrinkled green round and green wrinkled your assignment is to grow pure breeding plants guaranteed to produce yellow round peas how would you proceed one answer is to cross your two pure breeding strains yy rr yy rr to generate a dihybrid yy rr then selfcross the dihybrid and plant only the yellow round peas only one out of nine of such progeny those grown from peas with a yy rr genotype will be appropriate for your uses to find these plants you could subject each yellow round candidate to a testcross for genotype with a green wrinkled yy rr plant as illustrated in fig if the testcross yields all yellow round offspring testcross a you can sell your test plant because you know it is homozygous for both pea color and pea shape if your testcross yields yellow round and yellow wrinkled testcross b or yellow round and green round testcross c you know that the candidate plant in question is genetically homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for the other and must therefore be discarded finally if the testcross yields yellow round yellow wrinkled green round and green wrinkled testcross d you know that the plant is a heterozygote for both the pea color and the pea shape genes geneticists use mendels laws to calculate probabilities and make predictions mendel performed several sets of dihybrid crosses and also carried out multihybrid crosses matings between the f progeny of pure breeding parents that differed in three or more unrelated traits in all of these experiments he observed numbers and ratios very close to what he expected on the basis of his two general biological principles the alleles of a gene segregate during the formation of egg or sperm and the alleles of different genes assort independently of each other mendels laws of inheritance in conjunction with the mathematical rules of probability provide geneticists with powerful tools for predicting and interpreting the results of genetic crosses but as with all tools they have their limitations we examine here both the power and the limitations of mendelian analysis first the power using simple mendelian analysis it is possible to make accurate predictions about the offspring of extremely complex crosses suppose you want to predict the occurrence of one specific genotype in a cross involving several independently assorting genes for example if hybrids that are heterozygous for four traits are allowed to self fertilize aa bb cc dd aa bb cc dd what proportion of their progeny will have the genotype aa bb cc dd you could set up a punnett square to answer the question because for each trait there are two different alleles the number of different eggs or sperm is found by raising to the power of the number of differing traits n where n is the number of traits by this calculation each hybrid parent in this cross with traits would make different kinds of gametes the punnett square depicting such a cross would thus contain boxes setting up such a square may be fine if you live in a monastery with a bit of time on your hands but not if youre taking a hour exam it would be much simpler to analyze the problem by breaking down the multihybrid cross into four independently assorting monohybrid crosses remember that the genotypic ratios of each monohybrid cross are homozygote for the dominant allele to heterozygotes to homozygote for the recessive allele thus you can find the probability of aa bb cc dd by multiplying the probability of each independent event aa of the progeny produced by aa aa bb cc dd the punnett square approach would provide the same answer but it would require much more time if instead of a specific genotype you want to predict the probability of a certain phenotype you can again use the product rule as long as you know the phenotypic ratios produced by each pair of alleles in the cross for example if in the multihybrid cross of aa bb cc dd aa bb cc dd you want to know how many offspring will show the dominant a trait genotype aa or aa or the recessive b trait genotype bb the dominant c trait genotype cc or cc and the dominant d trait genotype dd or dd you simply multiply in this way the rules of probability make it possible to predict the outcome of very complex crosses you can see from these examples that particular problems in genetics are amenable to particular modes of analysis as a rule of thumb punnett squares are excellent for visualizing simple crosses involving a few genes but they become unwieldy in the dissection of more complicated matings direct calculations of probabilities such as those in the two preceding problems are useful when you want to know the chances of one or a few outcomes of complex crosses if however you want to know all the outcomes of a multihybrid cross a branched line diagram is the best way to go as it will keep track of all the possibilities in an organized fashion now the limitations of mendelian analysis like mendel if you were to breed pea plants or corn or any other organism you would most likely observe some deviation from the ratios you expected in each generation what can account for such variation one element is chance as witnessed in the common coin toss experiment with each throw the probability of the coin coming up heads is equal to the likelihood it will come up tails but if you toss a coin times you may get heads and tails or vice versa if you toss it times you are more likely to get a result closer to the expected heads and tails the larger the number of trials the lower the probability that chance significantly skews the data the statistical benefit is one reason mendel worked with large numbers of pea plants mendels laws in fact have great predictive power for populations of organisms but they do not tell us what will happen in any one individual with a garden full of selffertilizing monohybrid pea plants for example you can expect that of the f progeny will show the dominant phenotype and the recessive but you cannot predict the phenotype of any particular f plant in chapter we discuss mathematical methods for assessing whether the chance variation observed in a sample of individuals within a population is compatible with a genetic hypothesis mendels genius was unappreciated before mendels insights into the workings of heredity were a breakthrough of monumental proportions by counting and analyzing data from hundreds of pea plant crosses he inferred the existence of genes independent units that determine the observable patterns of inheritance for particular traits his work explained the reappearance of hidden traits disproved the idea of blended inheritance and showed that mother and father make an equal genetic contribution to the next generation the model of heredity that he formulated was so specific that he could test predictions based on it by observation and experiment with the exception of abbot napp none of mendels contemporaries appreciated the importance of his research mendel did not teach at a prestigious university and was not well known outside br nn even in br nn members of the natural science society were disappointed when he presented experiments on plant hybrids to them they wanted to view and discuss intriguing mutants and lovely flowers so they did not appreciate his numerical analyses mendel it seems was far ahead of his time sadly despite written requests from mendel that others try to replicate his studies no one repeated his experiments several citations of his paper between and referred to his expertise as a plant breeder but made no mention of his laws moreover at the time mendel presented his work no one had yet seen the structures within cells the chromosomes that actually carry the genes that would happen only in the next few decades as described in chapter if scientists had been able to see these structures they might have more readily accepted mendels ideas because the chromosomes are actual physical structures that behave exactly as mendel predicted the science of genetics begins with the rediscovery of mendel working independently near the beginning of the twentieth century correns de vries and von tschermak each came to the same conclusions as those mendel summarized in his laws a c spl science source b interfoto alamy d ullstein bild getty images mendels work might have had an important influence on early debates about evolution if it had been more widely appreciated charles darwin who was unfamiliar with mendels work was plagued in his later years by criticism that his explanations for the persistence of variation in organisms were insufficient darwin considered such variation a cornerstone of his theory of evolution maintaining that natural selection would favor particular variants in a given population in a given environment if the selected combinations of variant traits were passed on to subsequent generations this transmission of variation would propel evolution he could not however say how that transmission might occur had darwin been aware of mendels ideas he might not have been backed into such an uncomfortable corner for years mendels laws lay dormant untested unconfirmed and unapplied then in years after mendels death carl correns hugo de vries and erich von tschermak independently rediscovered and acknowledged his work fig the scientific community had finally caught up with mendel within a decade investigators had coined many of the modern terms we have been using phenotype genotype homozygote heterozygote gene and genetics the label given to the twentieth century science of heredity mendels paper provided the new disciplines foundation his principles and analytic techniques endure today guiding geneticists and evolutionary biologists in their studies of genetic variation the influence of molecules on phenotype determines whether alleles are dominant or recessive we now know that genes specify the proteins and rnas that cells produce and that dictate cellular structure and function recently two genes were identified that are likely to correspond to mendels genes for seed shape and seed color the pea shape gene specifies an enzyme known as sbe for starch branching enzyme sbe catalyzes the conversion of amylose an unbranched linear molecule of starch to amylopectin a starch molecule composed of several branching chains fig a the dominant r allele of the pea shape gene determines a normal functioning sbe enzyme in contrast the recessive allele r specifies no sbe enzyme as a result rr homozygotes contain a high proportion of branched starch molecules which allows the peas to maintain a rounded shape in homozygous recessive rr peas sucrose builds up because less of it is converted into starch the excess sucrose modifies the osmotic pressure causing water to enter the young seeds as the seeds mature they lose the water shrink and wrinkle the single dominant allele in rr heterozygotes apparently specifies enough of the normal sbe enzyme to prevent wrinkling the pea color gene determines an enzyme called sgr for stay green sgr performs one step in the pathway leading to the breakdown of the green pigment chlorophyll a process that occurs naturally in peas as they mature fig b the dominant y allele specifies sgr and the recessive y allele does not homozygous yy or heterozygous yy peas are yellow because they each have enough sgr to break down all the chlorophyll homozygous yy peas stay green because they lack the sgr enzyme and the chlorophyll remains two general principles emerge from these molecular discoveries first a specific gene determines a specific protein in these cases an enzyme the activity of the protein may affect the phenotype of the pea plant in any number of ways depending on the biochemical pathway in which it functions second a pattern can be seen in both of these examples the dominant allele determines a normally functioning protein while the recessive allele does not specify a functional protein you will see in chapter that although it is certainly not always the case the molecular explanation described here is the most common reason why one allele is dominant to another recessive allele genes likely to be those mendel described for stem length and flower color have also been identified recently in both cases the dominant allele encodes a normally functioning protein and the recessive allele specifies either no protein or a less functional version of the normal protein essential concepts discrete units called genes control the appearance of inherited traits genes come in alternative forms called alleles a sexually reproducing organisms body cells contain two alleles for every gene these alleles may be the same in a homozygote or different in a heterozygote genotype refers to the alleles an individual possesses phenotype refers to the traits the individual exhibits the dominant allele controls the phenotype of a trait in heterozygotes the other allele in the heterozygote is recessive in monohybrid crosses the dominant and recessive phenotypes will appear in the progeny in a ratio of alleles segregate during the formation of gametes which thus contain only one allele of each gene male and female gametes unite at random at fertilization these two processes correspond to mendels law of segregation the segregation of alleles of any one gene is independent of the segregation of the alleles of other genes this principle is mendels law of independent assortment according to this law crosses between aa bb dihybrids will generate progeny with a phenotypic ratio of a b a bb aa b aa bb most often the dominant allele of a gene specifies a functional product a protein while the recessive allele determines either a less functional or nonfunctional version of the protein or no protein at all

amylopectin the r allele does not produce sbe the buildup of unbranched starch in rr peas ultimately causes seed wrinkling the y allele of the pea color gene specifies the enzyme sgr which functions

exhibits recessive or dominant inheritance explain why huntington disease is inherited as a dominant allele while cystic fibrosis is caused by a recessive allele although many human traits clearly run in families most do not show a simple mendelian pattern of inheritance suppose for example that you have brown eyes but both your parents eyes appear to be blue because blue is normally considered recessive to brown does this mean that you are adopted or that your father isnt really your father not necessarily because eye color is influenced by more than one gene like eye color most common and obvious human phenotypes arise from the interaction of many genes in contrast single gene traits in people usually involve an abnormality that is disabling or life threatening examples are the progressive neurological damage of huntington disease and the clogged lungs and potential respiratory failure of cystic fibrosis a defective allele of a single gene gives rise to huntington disease defective alleles of a different gene are responsible for cystic fibrosis table lists some of the roughly such single gene or mendelian traits known in humans as of as you will see the allele that causes huntington disease is dominant and the normal nondisease allele of this gene is recessive the opposite is true for cystic fibrosis the disease causing allele is recessive and the normal nondisease allele is dominant pedigrees aid the study of hereditary traits in human families determining a genetic defects pattern of transmission is not always an easy task because people make slippery genetic subjects their generation time is long and the families they produce are relatively small which makes statistical analysis difficult humans do not base their choice of mates on purely genetic considerations thus no pure breeding lines exist and no controlled matings are possible furthermore people rarely produce a true f generation like the one in which mendel observed the ratios from which he derived his rules because brothers and sisters almost never mate geneticists circumvent these difficulties by working with a large number of families or with several generations of a very large family in this way scientists can study the large numbers of genetically related individuals needed to establish the inheritance patterns of specific traits a family history known as a pedigree is an orderly diagram of a familys relevant genetic features extending back to at least both sets of grandparents and preferably through as many additional generations as possible from systematic pedigree analysis in the light of mendels laws geneticists can tell if a trait is determined by alternative alleles of a single gene and whether a single gene trait is dominant or recessive because mendels principles are so simple and straightforward a little logic can go a long way in explaining how traits are inherited in humans figure shows how to interpret a family pedigree diagram squares represent males circles are females diamonds indicate that the sex is unspecified family members affected by the trait in question are indicated by a filled in symbol for example a single horizontal line connecting a male and a female represents a mating a double connecting line designates a consanguineous mating that is a mating between relatives and a horizontal line above a series of symbols indicates the children of the same parents a sibship arranged and numbered from left to right in order of their birth roman numerals to the left or right of the diagram indicate the generations to reach a conclusion about the mode of inheritance of a family trait human geneticists must use a pedigree that supplies sufficient information for example researchers could not determine whether the allele causing the disease depicted at the bottom of fig is dominant or recessive solely on the basis of the simple pedigree shown the data are consistent with both possibilities if the trait is dominant then the father and the affected son are heterozygotes while the mother and the unaffected son are homozygotes for the recessive normal allele if instead the trait is recessive the father and affected son are homozygotes for the recessive disease causing allele while the mother and the unaffected son are heterozygotes several kinds of additional information could help resolve this uncertainty human geneticists would particularly want to know the frequency at which the trait in question is found in the population from which the family came if the trait is rare in the population then the allele giving rise to the trait should also be rare and the most likely hypothesis would require that the fewest genetically unrelated people carry the allele only the father in fig would need to have a dominant disease causing allele but both parents would need to carry a recessive disease causing allele the father two copies and the mother one however even the information that the trait is rare does not allow us to draw the firm conclusion that it is inherited in a dominant fashion the pedigree in the figure is so limited that we cannot be sure the two parents are themselves unrelated as we discuss later in more detail related parents might have both received the same rare recessive allele from their common ancestor this example illustrates why human geneticists try to collect family histories that cover several generations we now look at more extensive pedigrees for the dominant trait of huntington disease and for the recessive condition of cystic fibrosis the patterns by which these traits appear in the pedigrees provide important clues that can indicate modes of inheritance and allow geneticists to assign genotypes to family members

ected generation generation a vertical pattern of inheritance indicates a rare dominant trait huntington disease is named for george huntington the new york physician who first described its course this illness usually shows up in middle age and slowly destroys its victims both mentally and physically symptoms include intellectual deterioration severe depression and jerky irregular movements all caused by the progressive death of nerve cells if one parent develops the symptoms his or her children usually have a probability of suffering from the disease provided they live to adulthood because symptoms are not present at birth and manifest themselves only later in life huntington disease is known as a late onset genetic trait how would you proceed in assigning genotypes to the individuals in the huntington disease pedigree depicted in fig first you would need to find out if the diseaseproducing allele is dominant or recessive several clues suggest that huntington disease is transmitted by a dominant allele of a single gene everyone who develops the disease has at least one parent who shows the trait and in several generations approximately half of the offspring are affected the pattern of affected individuals is thus vertical if you trace back through the ancestors of any affected individual you would see at least one affected person in each generation giving a continuous line of family members with the disease when a disease is rare in the population as a whole a vertical pattern is strong evidence that a dominant allele causes the trait the alternative would require that many unrelated people carry a rare recessive allele a recessive trait that is extremely common might also show up in every generation we examine this possibility in problem at the end of this chapter figure huntington disease a rare dominant trait all individuals represented by filled in symbols are heterozygotes except i who could instead have been homozygous for the dominant hd disease allele all individuals represented by open symbols are homozygotes for the recessive hd normal allele among the children of the consanguineous mating dna testing shows that some are hd hd some are hd hd and some are hd hd the diamond designation masks personal details to protect confidentiality in tracking a dominant allele through a pedigree you can view every mating between an affected and an unaffected partner as analogous to a testcross if some of the offspring do not have huntington disease you know the parent showing the trait is a heterozygote as an exercise you should check your own genotype assignments against the answers in the caption to fig notice also in the legend to fig that human geneticists use different symbols than mendels for alleles of genes in human genotypes all alleles are written in uppercase if the allele specifies a normally functioning gene product the allele symbol has a superscript alleles that specify no gene product or abnormal gene products sometimes have no superscript at all as in the fig legend but in other cases they have a superscript other than that signifies a particular type of abnormal allele see the appendix guidelines for gene nomenclature for further discussion of genetic notation like mendels pea genes the gene that causes huntington disease has been identified and studied at the molecular level in fact in this was the first human disease gene identified molecularly using methods that will be described in chapter the protein product of the huntington disease gene called huntingtin or htt is needed for the proper physiology of nerve cells but the proteins precise role in these cells is not yet understood the dominant disease allele hd specifies a defective htt protein that over time damages nerve cells fig the disease allele is dominant to the normal allele because the presence of the normal htt protein in heterozygotes does not prevent the abnormal protein from damaging the cells it is important to note that this explanation for the huntington disease allele is only one of many different molecular mechanisms that may result in a disease allele that is dominant to the normal allele of a particular gene no effective treatment yet exists for huntington disease and because of its late onset there was until the s no way for children of a huntington parent to know before middle age usually until well after their own childbearing years whether they carried the huntington disease allele hd most people with the disease allele are hd hd heterozygotes so their children would have a probability of inheriting hd and before they are diagnosed a probability of passing the defective allele on to one of their children in the mid s with new knowledge of the gene molecular geneticists developed a dna test that determines whether an individual carries the hd allele this test will be explained in detail in chapter because of the lack of effective treatment for the disease some young adults whose parents died of huntington disease prefer not to be tested so that they will not learn their own fate prematurely however other at risk individuals employ the test for the hd allele to guide their decisions about having children if someone whose parent had huntington disease does not have hd he or she has no chance of developing the disease or of transmitting it to offspring if the test shows the presence of hd the at risk person and his or her partner might choose to conceive a child using in vitro fertilization ivf technology described in chapter that allows for genotyping of early stage embryos using ivf only embryos lacking the hd disease allele would be introduced into the mothers womb the genetics and society box developing guidelines for genetic screening discusses significant social and ethical issues raised by information obtained from family pedigrees and molecular tests figure why the allele for huntington disease is dominant people who are hd hd or hd hd exhibit huntington disease because the hd allele produces an abnormal htt protein that damages nerve cells homozygotes for the normal allele hd hd produce only normal htt protein and do not have the disease the disease allele hd is dominant because even when the normal protein is present in hd hd heterozygotes the abnormal protein damages nerve cells hd hd homozygosity is possible because the abnormal htt protein retains some function of the normal protein a horizontal pattern of inheritance indicates a rare recessive trait unlike huntington disease most confirmed single gene diseases in humans are caused by recessive alleles one reason is that with the exception of late onset traits deleterious dominant alleles are unlikely to be transmitted to the next generation for example if people affected with huntington disease all died by the age of the disease would disappear from the population in contrast individuals can carry one allele for a recessive disease without ever being affected by any symptoms figure shows three pedigrees for cystic fibrosis the most commonly inherited recessive disease among caucasian children in the united states a double dose of the recessive cf allele meaning the absence of a cf allele causes a fatal disorder in which the lungs pancreas and other organs become clogged with a thick viscous mucus that can interfere with breathing and digestion one in every white americans is born with cystic fibrosis and only of them survive into their s note two salient features of the cystic fibrosis pedigrees first the family pattern of people showing the trait is often horizontal the parents grandparents and great grandparents of children born with cystic fibrosis do not themselves manifest the disease while several brothers and sisters in a single generation may a horizontal pedigree pattern is a strong indication that the trait is recessive the unaffected parents are heterozygous carriers they bear a dominant normal allele cf that masks the effects of the recessive abnormal one an estimated million americans are carriers of a recessive cf allele table summarizes some of the clues found in pedigrees that can help you decide whether a trait is caused by a dominant or a recessive allele the second salient feature of the cystic fibrosis pedigrees is that many of the couples who produce afflicted children are blood relatives that is their mating is consanguineous as indicated by the double line in fig a the consanguineous mating in generation v is between third cousins of course children with cystic fibrosis can also have unrelated carrier parents but because relatives share genes their offspring have a much greater than average chance of receiving two copies of a rare allele whether or not they are related carrier parents are both heterozygotes thus among their offspring the proportion of unaffected to affected children is expected to be to look at it another way the chances are that out of children of two heterozygous carriers will be homozygous cystic fibrosis sufferers you can gauge your understanding of this inheritance pattern by assigning a genotype to each person in fig and then checking your answers against the caption note that for several individuals such as the generation i individuals in part a of the figure it is impossible to assign a full genotype we know that one of these people must be the carrier who supplied the original cf allele but we do not know if it was the male or the female as with an ambiguous dominant phenotype in peas the unknown second allele is indicated by a dash in fig a a mating between the unrelated carriers vi and vi produced a child with cystic fibrosis how likely is such a marriage between unrelated carriers for a recessive genetic condition the answer depends on the gene in question and the particular population into which a person is born as table shows the incidence of genetic diseases and thus the frequency of their carriers varies markedly among populations such variation reflects the distinct genetic histories of different groups the area of genetics that analyzes differences among groups of individuals is called population genetics a subject we cover in detail in chapter notice that in fig a several unrelated unaffected people such as ii and ii married into the family under consideration although it is highly probable that these individuals are homozygotes for the normal allele of the gene cf cf a small chance whose magnitude depends on the population exists that any one of them could be a carrier of the disease genetic researchers identified the cystic fibrosis gene in soon after the huntington disease gene was identified the normal dominant cf allele makes a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr cftr protein forms a channel in the cell membranes that controls the flow of chloride ions through lung cells recessive cf disease alleles either produce no cftr or produce nonfunctional or less functional versions of the protein fig because of osmosis water flows into lung cells without cftr while a thick dehydrated mucus builds up outside the cells thus cf cf homozygotes have no functional cftr or not enough of this protein and exhibit cystic fibrosis gene therapy insertion of a normal cf gene into lung cells of patients has been tried to ameliorate the diseases debilitating symptoms but so far without success despite the failure to date of gene therapy identification of the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis has very recently led to effective treatments for the disease in patients with particular mutant alleles for example in the u s food and drug administration approved a drug cocktail called orkambi that helps the particular defective form of cftr specified by one of these alleles to function properly varied approaches to the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other inherited diseases will be discussed later in the book figure cystic fibrosis a recessive condition in a the two affected individuals vi and vii are cf cf that is homozygotes for the recessive disease allele their unaffected parents must be carriers so v v vi and vi must all be cf cf individuals ii ii iii iii iv and iv are probably also carriers we cannot determine which of the founders i or i was a carrier so we designate their genotypes as cf because the cf allele is relatively rare it is likely that ii ii iii iii iv and iv are cf cf homozygotes the genotype of the remaining unaffected people vi vi and vii is uncertain cf b and c these two families demonstrate horizontal patterns of inheritance without further information the unaffected children in each pedigree must be regarded as having a cf genotype developing guidelines for genetic screening should i be screened if a test is available for most inherited diseases no cures presently exist the psychological burden of anticipating a fatal late onset disease for which there is no treatment could be devastating and therefore some people might decide not to be tested others may object to testing for religious reasons or because of confidentiality concerns if a screening program is established who should be tested the answer depends on what the test is trying to accomplish as well as on its expense ultimately the cost of a procedure must be weighed against the usefulness of the data it provides in the united states for example only one tenth as many african americans as caucasians are affected by cystic fibrosis and asians almost never exhibit the disease should all racial groups be tested for cystic fibrosis or only caucasians should private employers and insurance companies be allowed to test their clients and employees some employers advocate genetic screening to reduce the incidence of occupational disease arguing that they can use genetic test results to make sure employees are not assigned to environments that might cause them harm critics of this position say that screening violates workers rights including the right to privacy increases racial and ethnic discrimination in the workplace and provides insurers with an excuse to deny coverage in president george w bush signed into law the genetic information nondiscrimination act which prohibits insurance companies and employers in the united states from discriminating on the basis of information derived from genetic tests finally how should people be educated about the meaning of test results in one small community screening program people identified as carriers of the recessive lifethreatening blood disorder known as thalassemia were ostracized as a result carriers ended up marrying one another only making medical matters worse by contrast in ferrara italy where new cases of thalassemia had been reported every year extensive screening combined with education was so successful that the s passed with only a few new cases of the disease given all of these considerations what kind of guidelines would you like to see established to ensure that genetic screening reaches the right people at the right time and that information gained from such screening is used for the right purposes in the early s the united states launched a national screening program for carriers of sickle cell anemia a recessive genetic disease that afflicts roughly in african americans the disease is caused by a particular allele called hb s of the globin gene the dominant normal allele is hb a the protein determined by the globin gene is one component of the oxygen carrying hemoglobin molecule hb s hb s homozygotes have sickle shaped red blood cells these patients suffer a decrease in oxygen supply tire easily and often develop heart failure from stress on the circulatory system the national screening program for sickle cell anemia was based on a simple test of hemoglobin mobility normal and sickling hemoglobins move at different rates in a gel people who participated in the screening program and found they were carriers could use the test results to make informed reproductive decisions a healthy man for example who learned he was a carrier that is that he was a hb s hb a heterozygote would not have to worry about having an affected child if his mate was a noncarrier the original sickle cell screening program based on detection of the abnormal hemoglobin protein was not an unqualified success largely because of insufficient educational follow through many who learned they were carriers mistakenly thought they had the disease moreover employers and insurance companies that obtained access to the information denied jobs or health insurance to some heterozygotes for no acceptable reason problems of public relations and education thus made a reliable screening test into a source of dissent and alienation today at risk families may be screened for a growing number of genetic disorders thanks to the ability to evaluate genotypes directly the need to establish guidelines for genetic screening thus becomes more and more pressing several related questions reveal the complexity of the issue why carry out genetic screening at all the first reason for screening is to obtain information that will benefit individuals for example if you learn at an early age that you have a genetic predisposition to heart disease you can change your lifestyle to improve your chances of staying healthy you can also use the results from genetic screening to make informed reproductive decisions the second reason for genetic screening which often conflicts with the first is to benefit groups within society insurance companies and employers for example would like to know who is at risk for various genetic conditions table how to recognize dominant and recessive traits in pedigrees dominant traits affected children always have at least one affected parent dominant traits show a vertical pattern of inheritance the trait shows up in every generation two affected parents can produce unaffected children if both parents are heterozygotes recessive traits affected individuals can be the children of two unaffected carriers particularly as a result of consanguineous matings all the children of two affected parents should be affected rare recessive traits show a horizontal pattern of inheritance the trait first appears among several members of one generation and is not seen in earlier generations recessive traits may show a vertical pattern of inheritance if the trait is extremely common in the population figure why the allele for cystic fibrosis is recessive the cftr protein regulates the passage of chloride ions green spheres through the cell membrane people who are homozygous for a cystic fibrosis disease allele cf cf have the disease because recessive disease alleles either specify no cftr protein as shown or encode abnormal cftr proteins that do not function at all or do not function as well as the normal protein not shown disease alleles cf are recessive because cf cf heterozygotes produce cftr from the normal cf allele and this amount of cftr is sufficient for normal lung function cf cf or cf cf cf cf inside of the cell outside of the cell mucus cystic fibrosis cl ions inside of the cell outside of the cell normal lipid bilayer of cell membrane cftr protein in a vertical pattern of transmission a trait that appears in an affected individual also appears in at least one parent one of the affected parents parents and so on if a trait is rare a pedigree with a vertical pattern usually indicates that the disease causing allele is dominant in a horizontal pattern of transmission a trait that appears in an affected individual may not appear in any ancestors but it may appear in some of the persons siblings a pedigree with a horizontal pattern usually indicates a rare recessive disease causing allele affected individuals are often products of consanguineous mating various kinds of biochemical events may explain why some disease alleles are dominant in the case of huntington disease the disease causing hd allele specifies an abnormal deleterious version of the protein produced by the normal recessive allele recessive disease alleles like the cf alleles that cause cystic fibrosis usually specify either no protein or less functional versions of the protein that the normal dominant allele produces mendel answered the three basic questions about heredity as follows to what is inherited he replied alleles of genes to how is it inherited he responded according to the principles of segregation and independent assortment and to what is the role of chance in heredity he said for each individual inheritance is determined by chance but within a population this chance operates in a context of strictly defined probabilities within a decade of the rediscovery of mendels work numerous breeding studies had shown that mendels laws hold true not only for seven pairs of antagonistic characteristics in peas but also for many diverse traits in a wide variety of sexually reproducing plant and animal species some of these same breeding studies however raised a challenge to the new genetics for certain traits in certain species the studies uncovered unanticipated phenotypic ratios or the results included f and f progeny with novel phenotypes that resembled those of neither pure breeding parent these phenomena could not be explained by mendels hypothesis that for each gene two alternative alleles one completely dominant the other recessive determine a single trait we now know that most common traits including skin color eye color and height in humans are determined by interactions between two or more genes we also know that within a given population more than two alleles may be present for some of those genes chapter shows how the genetic analysis of such complex traits that is traits produced by complex interactions between genes and between genes and the environment extended rather than contradicted mendels laws of inheritance solving genetics problems the best way to evaluate and increase your understanding of the material in the chapter is to apply your knowledge in solving genetics problems genetics word problems are like puzzles take them in slowly dont be overwhelmed by the whole problem identify useful facts given in the problem and use the facts to deduce additional information use genetic principles and logic to work toward the solutions the more problems you do the easier they become in solving problems you will not only solidify your understanding of genetic concepts but you will also develop basic analytical skills that are applicable in many disciplines note that some of the problems at the end of each chapter are designed to introduce supplementary but important concepts that expand on the information in the text you can nonetheless answer such problems using logical inferences from your reading solving genetics problems requires much more than simply plugging numbers into formulas each problem is unique and requires thoughtful evaluation of the information given and the question being asked the following are general guidelines you can follow in approaching these word problems a read through the problem once to get some sense of the concepts involved b go back through the problem noting all the information supplied to you for example genotypes or phenotypes of offspring or parents may be given to you or implied in the problem represent the known information in a symbolic format assign symbols for alleles use these symbols to indicate genotypes make a diagram of the crosses including genotypes and phenotypes given or implied be sure that you do not assign different letters of the alphabet to two alleles of the same gene as this can cause confusion also be careful to discriminate clearly between the upper and lowercases of letters such as c c or s s c now reassess the question and work toward the solution using the information given make sure you answer the question being asked d when you finish the problem check to see that the answer makes sense you can often check solutions by working backwards that is see if you can reconstruct the data from your answer e after you have completed a question and checked your answer spend a minute to think about which major concepts were involved in the solution this is a critical step for improving your understanding of genetics for each chapter the logic involved in solving two or three types of problems is described in detail i in cats white patches are caused by the dominant allele p while pp individuals are solid colored short hair is caused by a dominant allele s while ss cats have long hair a long haired cat with patches whose mother was solid colored and short haired mates with a short haired solid colored cat whose mother was long haired and solid colored what kinds of kittens can arise from this mating and in what proportions answer the solution to this problem requires an understanding of dominance recessiveness gamete formation and the independent assortment of alleles of two genes in a cross first make a representation of the known information mothers solid short haired solid long haired cross cat cat patches long haired solid short haired what genotypes can you assign any cat showing a recessive phenotype must be homozygous for the recessive allele therefore the long haired cats are ss solid cats are pp cat is long haired so it must be homozygous for the recessive allele ss this cat has the dominant phenotype of patches and could be either pp or pp but because the mother was pp and could only contribute a p allele in her gametes cat must be pp cat s full genotype is pp ss similarly cat is solid colored so it must be homozygous for the recessive allele pp because this cat is shorthaired it could have either the ss or ss genotype its mother was long haired ss and could only contribute an s allele in her gamete so cat must be heterozygous ss the full genotype is pp ss the cross is therefore between pp ss cat and pp ss cat to determine the types of kittens first establish the types of gametes that can be produced by each cat and then set up a punnett square to determine the genotypes of the offspring cat pp ss produces ps and ps gametes in equal proportions cat pp ss produces ps and ps gametes in equal proportions four types of kittens can result from this mating with equal probability pp ss patches short haired pp ss patches long haired pp ss solid short haired and pp ss solid long haired the following table demonstrates that you could also work through this problem using the product rule of probability instead of a punnett square the principles are the same gametes produced in equal amounts by either parent are combined at random cat cat gamete gamete progeny p s p s pp ss patches short haired p s p s pp ss patches long haired p s p s pp ss solid colored short haired p s p s pp ss solid colored long haired in tomatoes red fruit is dominant to yellow fruit and purple stems are dominant to green stems the progeny from one mating consisted of red fruit purple stem plants red fruit green stem plants yellow fruit purple stem plants and yellow fruit green stem plants what were the genotypes of the parents in this cross answer this problem requires an understanding of independent assortment in a dihybrid cross as well as the ratios predicted from monohybrid crosses designate the alleles r red r yellow p purple stems p green stems in genetics problems the ratios of offspring can indicate the genotype of parents you will usually need to total the number of progeny and approximate the ratio of offspring in each of the different classes for this problem in which the inheritance of two traits is given consider each trait independently for red fruit there are red fruited plants out of a total of plants this value is close to about of the plants have yellow fruit from mendels work you know that a phenotypic ratio results from crosses between plants that are hybrid heterozygous for one gene therefore the genotype for fruit color of each parent must have been rr for stem color or plants had purple stems about half had purple stems and the other half had green stems a phenotypic ratio occurs when a heterozygote is mated to a homozygous recessive as in a testcross the parents genotypes must have been pp and pp for stem color the complete genotype of the parent plants in this cross was rr pp rr pp iii tay sachs is a recessive lethal disease in which there is neurological deterioration early in life this disease is rare in the population overall but is found at relatively high frequency in ashkenazi jews from eastern europe a woman whose maternal uncle had the disease is trying to determine the probability that she and her husband could have an affected child her father does not come from a high risk population her husbands sister died of the disease at an early age a draw the pedigree of the individuals described include the genotypes where possible b determine the probability that the couples first child will be affected answer this problem requires an understanding of dominance recessiveness and probability first diagram the pedigree and then assign as many genotypes as possible using the following allele designations t normal allele t tay sachs allele a ected uncle a ected sister tttt tt tt tt tt tt i ii iii the genotypes of the two affected individuals the womans uncle ii and the husbands sister iii are tt because the uncle was affected both of his parents must have been heterozygous similarly as the husbands sister iii is affected both of her parents ii and ii must be heterozygotes finally because individual ii is not from a high risk population the most likely assumption is that he is tt you next need to determine the chance that a child of iii and iii that is individual iv would have taysachs tt for that to be possible both iii and iii must be tt given that neither is tt for iii to be tt ii must be tt calculating the chance that ii is tt is a bit tricky at first it appears that the chance is that the daughter of two heterozygous tt parents would be tt the expected progeny ratio is tt tt tt however in this case you have additional information to consider ii is unaffected and thus the genotype tt is ruled out that leaves tt tt or a chance that ii is tt if so the chance that ii would transmit the t allele to iii is thus the probability that iii is tt is this fact implies that ii could be either tt probability or tt probability if ii is tt the chance that she would transmit the t allele to iii is thus the probability that iii is tt is what is the chance that iii is tt both of his parents are heterozygous and he is unaffected thus using similar logic the likelihood that iii is tt is the probability that both iii and iii are tt is the chance that the child of two tt parents would be tt is thus the overall likelihood that iv the child of iii and iii would have tay sachs is vocabulary for each of the terms in the left column choose the best matching phrase in the

adults with piebald spotting have one child who has this trait and a second child with normal skin pigmentation a is the piebald spotting trait dominant or recessive what information led you to this answer b what are the genotypes of the parents as a drosophila research geneticist you keep stocks of flies of specific genotypes you have a fly that has normal wings dominant phenotype flies with short wings are homozygous for a recessive allele of the wing length gene you need to know if this fly with normal wings is pure breeding or heterozygous for the wing length trait what cross would you do to determine the genotype and what results would you expect for each possible genotype a mutant cucumber plant has flowers that fail to open when mature crosses can be done with this plant by manually opening and pollinating the flowers with pollen from another plant when closed open crosses were done all the f progeny were open the f plants were open and closed a cross of closed f gave open and closed how is the closed trait inherited what evidence led you to your conclusion in a particular population of mice certain individuals display a phenotype called short tail which is inherited as a dominant trait some individuals display a recessive trait called dilute which affects coat color which of these traits would be easier to eliminate from the population by selective

fruit fly with genotype tt nn is mated to a male of genotype tt nn what is the probability that any one of their offspring will have normal phenotypes for both characters b what phenotypes would you expect among the offspring of this cross if you obtained progeny how many of each phenotypic class would you expect considering the yellow and green pea color phenotypes studied by gregor mendel a what is the biochemical function of the protein that is specified by the gene responsible for the pea color phenotype b a null allele of a gene is an allele that does not specify any of the biochemical function that the gene normally provides of the two alleles y and y which is more likely to be a null allele c in terms of the underlying biochemistry why is the y allele dominant to the y allele d why are peas that are yy homozygotes green e the amount of the protein specified by a gene is roughly proportional to the number of functional copies of the gene carried by a cell or individual what do the phenotypes of yy homozygotes yy heterozygotes and yy homozygotes tell us about the amount of the sgr enzyme the product of the pea color gene needed to produce a yellow color the sgr enzyme is not needed for the survival of a pea plant but the genomes of organisms contain many so called essential genes needed for an individuals survival for such genes heterozygotes for the normal allele and the null allele survive but individuals homozygous for the null allele die soon after the male and female gametes each with a null allele come together at fertilization in light of your answer to part e what does this fact tell you about the advantage to an organism of having two copies of their genes g do you think that a single pea pod could contain peas with different phenotypes explain h do you think that a pea pod could be of one color say green while the peas within the pod could be of a different color say yellow explain what would have been the outcome the genotypic and phenotypic ratios in the f of mendels dihybrid cross shown in fig if the alleles of the pea color gene y y and the pea shape gene r r did not assort independently and instead the alleles inherited from a parent always stayed together as a unit recall that mendel obtained pure breeding plants with either long or short stems and that hybrids had long stems fig monohybrid crosses produced an f generation with a ratio of long stems to short stems indicating that this difference in stem length is governed by a single gene the gene that likely controlled this trait in mendels plants has been discovered and it specifies an enzyme called g h which catalyzes the reaction shown in the accompanying figure the product of the reaction gibberellin is a growth hormone that makes plants grow tall what is the most likely hypothesis to explain the difference between the dominant allele l and the recessive allele l g h precursor gibberellin co h o h co h co h o h h ho the gene that likely controlled flower color purple or white in mendels pea plants has also been identified the flower color gene specifies a protein called bhlh required by cells to make three different enzymes dfr ans and gt that function in the pathway shown in the accompanying figure leading to synthesis of the purple pigment anthocyanin a what is the most likely explanation for the difference between the dominant allele p and the recessive allele p of the gene responsible for these flower colors b given the biochemical pathway shown could a different gene have been the one governing mendels flower colors for each of the following human pedigrees indicate whether the inheritance pattern is recessive or dominant what feature s of the pedigree did you use to determine the mode of

the disease is the disease shown in the following pedigree caused by a dominant or a recessive allele why based on this limited pedigree do you think the disease allele is rare or common in the population why figure shows the inheritance of huntington disease in a family from a small village near lake maracaibo in venezuela the village was founded by a small number of immigrants and generations of their descendants have remained concentrated in this isolated location the allele for huntington disease has remained unusually prevalent there a why could you not conclude definitively that the disease is the result of a dominant or a recessive allele solely by looking at this pedigree b is there any information you could glean from the familys history that might imply the disease is due to a dominant rather than a recessive allele consider the cystic fibrosis pedigree in figure a a assuming that one of the individuals in generation i was a carrier and that no one from outside the family was a carrier what was the probability that any single child of the consanguineous couple in generation v would have cystic fibrosis assume that none of their children is born yet so you dont know that vi has the disease b assuming that one of the individuals in generation i was a carrier and that people in the population is a carrier and knowing that vi has the disease how likely was it that vii would be affected the common grandfather of two first cousins has hereditary hemochromatosis a recessive condition causing an abnormal buildup of iron in the body neither of the cousins has the disease nor do any of their relatives a if the first cousins had a child what is the chance that the child would have hemochromatosis assume that the unrelated unaffected parents of the cousins are not carriers b how would your calculation change if you knew that out of every unaffected people in the population including the unrelated parents of these cousins was a carrier for

chromosomes carries hundreds of genes adrian t sumner chromosomes the carriers of genes sex chromosomes and sex determination mitosis cell division that preserves chromosome number meiosis cell divisions that halve chromosome number gametogenesis validation of the chromosome theory sex linked and sexually dimorphic traits in humans in the spherical membrane bound nuclei of plant and animal cells prepared for viewing under the microscope chromosomes appear as brightly colored threadlike bodies the nuclei of normal human cells carry pairs of chromosomes for a total of noticeable differences in size and shape exist among the pairs but within each pair the two chromosomes appear to match exactly the only exceptions are the males sex chromosomes designated x and y which constitute an unmatched pair down syndrome was the first human genetic disorder attributable not to a gene mutation but to an abnormal number of chromosomes children born with down syndrome have chromosomes in each somatic cell nucleus because they carry three instead of the normal pair of a very small chromosome referred to as number the aberrant genotype called trisomy gives rise to an abnormal phenotype including a wide skull that is flatter than normal at the back an unusually large tongue learning disabilities caused by the abnormal development of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain and a propensity to respiratory infections as well as heart disorders rapid aging and leukemia fig how can one extra copy of a chromosome that is itself of normal size and shape cause such wide ranging phenotypic effects the answer has two parts first and foremost chromosomes are the cellular structures responsible for transmitting genetic information in this chapter we describe how geneticists concluded that chromosomes are the carriers of genes an idea that became known as the chromosome theory of inheritance the second part of the answer is that proper development depends not just on what type of genetic material is present but also on how much of it there is thus the mechanisms governing gene transmission during cell division must vigilantly maintain each cells chromosome number cell division proceeds through the precise chromosome parceling mechanisms of mitosis for somatic or body cells and meiosis for gametes eggs and sperm when the machinery does not function properly errors in chromosome distribution can have dire repercussions on the individuals health and survival down syndrome for example is the result of a failure of chromosome segregation during meiosis the meiotic error gives rise to an egg or sperm carrying an extra chromosome which if incorporated in the zygote at fertilization is passed on via mitosis to every cell of the developing embryo trisomy three copies of a chromosome instead of two can occur with other chromosomes as well but in nearly all of these cases the condition is prenatally lethal and results in a miscarriage two themes emerge in our discussion of meiosis and mitosis first direct microscopic observations of chromosomes during gamete formation led early twentieth century investigators to recognize that chromosome movements parallel the behavior of mendels genes so chromosomes are likely to carry the genetic material this chromosome theory of inheritance was proposed in and was confirmed in the following years through elegant experiments performed mainly using the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster second the chromosome theory transformed the concept of a gene from an abstract particle to a physical reality part of a chromosome that could be seen and manipulated figure down syndrome one extra chromosome has widespread phenotypic consequences trisomy usually causes changes in physical appearance as well as in the potential for learning many children with down syndrome such as the fifth grader at the center of the photograph can participate fully in regular activities richard hutchings chromosomes the carriers of genes learning objectives differentiate among somatic cells gametes and zygotes with regard to the number and origin of their chromosomes distinguish between homologous and nonhomologous chromosomes list the differences between sister chromatids and nonsister chromatids one of the first questions asked at the birth of an infant is it a boy or a girl acknowledges that male and female normally are mutually exclusive characteristics like the yellow versus green of mendels peas whats more among humans and most other sexually reproducing species a roughly ratio exists between the two sexes both males and females produce cells specialized for reproduction sperm or eggs that serve as a physical link to the next generation in bridging the gap between generations these gametes must each contribute half of the genetic material for making a normal healthy son or daughter whatever part of the gamete carries this material its structure and function must be able to account for the either or aspect of sex determination as well as the generally observed ratio of males to females these two features of sex determination were among the earliest clues to the cellular basis of heredity genes reside in the nucleus the nature of the specific link between sex and reproduction remained a mystery until anton van leeuwenhoek one of the earliest and most astute of microscopists discovered in that semen contains spermatozoa literally sperm animals he imagined that these microscopic creatures might enter the egg and somehow achieve fertilization but it was not possible to confirm this hypothesis for another years then during a year period starting in about the same time gregor mendel was beginning his pea experiments microscopists studying fertilization in frogs and sea urchins observed the union of male and female gametes and recorded the details of the process in a series of drawings these drawings as well as later micrographs photographs taken through a microscope clearly show that egg and sperm nuclei are the only elements contributed equally by maternal and paternal gametes this observation implies that something in the nucleus contains the hereditary material in humans the nuclei of the gametes are less than millionths of a meter in diameter it is indeed remarkable that the genetic link between generations is packaged within such an exceedingly small space genes reside in chromosomes further investigations some dependent on technical innovations in microscopy suggested that yet smaller discrete structures within the nucleus are the repository of genetic information in the s for example a newly discovered combination of organic and inorganic dyes revealed the existence of the long brightly staining threadlike bodies within the nucleus that we call chromosomes literally colored bodies it was now possible to follow the movement of chromosomes during different kinds of cell division in embryonic cells the chromosomal threads split lengthwise in two just before cell division and each of the two newly forming daughter cells receives one half of every split thread the kind of nuclear division followed by cell division that results in two daughter cells containing the same number and type of chromosomes as the original parent cell is called mitosis from the greek mitos meaning thread and osis meaning formation or increase in the cells that give rise to male and female gametes the chromosomes composing each pair become segregated so that the resulting gametes receive only one chromosome from each chromosome pair the kind of nuclear division that generates egg or sperm cells containing half the number of chromosomes found in other cells within the same organism is called meiosis from the greek word for diminution fertilization the union of haploid gametes to produce diploid zygotes in the first decade of the twentieth century cytologists scientists who use the microscope to study cell structure showed that the chromosomes in a fertilized egg actually consist of two matching sets one contributed by the maternal gamete the other by the paternal gamete the corresponding maternal and paternal chromosomes appear alike in size and shape forming pairs with one exception the sex chromosomes which we discuss in a later section gametes and other cells that carry only a single set of chromosomes are called haploid from the greek word for single zygotes and other cells carrying two matching sets are diploid from the greek word for double the number of chromosomes in a normal haploid cell is designated by the shorthand symbol n the number of chromosomes in a normal diploid cell is then n figure shows diploid cells as well as the haploid gametes that arise from them in drosophila where n and n in humans n n you can see how the halving of chromosome number during meiosis and gamete formation followed by the union of two gametes chromosomes at fertilization normally allows a constant n number of chromosomes to be maintained from generation to generation in all individuals of a species the chromosomes of every pair must segregate from each other during meiosis so that the haploid gametes will each have one complete set of chromosomes after fertilization forms the zygote the process of mitosis then ensures that all the somatic cells of the developing individual have identical diploid chromosome sets species variations in the number and shape of chromosomes scientists analyze the chromosomal makeup of a cell when the chromosomes are most visible at a specific moment in the cell cycle of growth and division just before the nucleus divides at this point known as metaphase described in detail later individual chromosomes have duplicated and condensed from thin threads into compact rodlike structures each chromosome now consists of two identical halves known as sister chromatids fig the specific location at which sister chromatids are attached to each other is called the centromere each sister chromatid has its own centromere fig but in the duplicated chromosome the two sister centromeres are pulled together so tightly that they form a constriction within which they cannot be resolved from each other even in images obtained in the scanning electron microscope see the picture at the beginning of the chapter diploid versus haploid n versus n fruit fly somatic cells are diploid they carry a maternal and paternal copy of each chromosome meiosis generates haploid gametes with only one copy of each chromosome in drosophila diploid cells have eight chromosomes n while gametes have four chromosomes n note that the chromosomes in this diagram are pictured before their replication the x and y chromosomes determine the sex of the individual drosophila melanogaster figure metaphase chromosomes can be classified by centromere position before cell division each chromosome replicates into two sister chromatids connected at their centromeres in highly condensed metaphase chromosomes the centromeres can appear near the middle a metacentric chromosome very near an end an acrocentric chromosome or anywhere in between in a diploid cell one homologous chromosome in each pair is from the mother and the other from the father figure karyotype of a human male photos of metaphase human chromosomes are paired and arranged in order of decreasing size in a normal human male karyotype pairs of autosomes are present as well as an x and a y n homologous chromosomes share the same characteristic pattern of dark and light bands pair of homologous metacentric chromosomes centromere centromere sister chromatids homologous chromosomes homologous chromosomes pair of homologous acrocentric chromosomes nonsister chromatids nonhomologous chromosomes geneticists often describe chromosomes according to the location of the centromere fig in metacentric chromosomes the centromere is more or less in the middle in acrocentric chromosomes the centromere is very close to one end chromosomes thus always have two arms separated by a centromere but the relative sizes of the two arms can vary in different chromosomes cells in metaphase can be fixed and stained with one of several dyes that highlight the chromosomes and accentuate the centromeres the dyes also produce characteristic banding patterns made up of lighter and darker regions chromosomes that match in size shape and banding are called homologous chromosomes or homologs the two homologs of each pair contain the same set of genes although for some of those genes they may carry different alleles the differences between alleles occur at the molecular level and dont show up in the microscope figure introduces a system of notation employed throughout this book using color to indicate degrees of relatedness between chromosomes thus sister chromatids which are identical duplicates appear in the same shade of the same color homologous chromosomes which carry the same genes but may vary in the identity of particular alleles are pictured in different shades light or dark of the same color nonhomologous chromosomes which carry completely unrelated sets of genetic information appear in different colors to study the chromosomes of a single organism geneticists arrange micrographs of the stained chromosomes in homologous pairs of decreasing size to produce a karyotype karyotype assembly can now be speeded and automated by computerized image analysis figure shows the karyotype of a human male with chromosomes arranged in matching pairs of chromosomes and one nonmatching pair the chromosomes in matching pairs are known as autosomes the two unmatched chromosomes in this male karyotype are called sex chromosomes because they determine the sex of the individual we discuss sex chromosomes in more detail in subsequent sections modern methods of dna analysis can reveal differences between the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes of a homologous pair and can thus track the origin of the extra chromosome that causes down syndrome in individual patients in of cases the third chromosome comes from the egg in from the sperm the genetics and society box entitled prenatal genetic diagnosis describes how physicians use karyotype analysis and a technique called amniocentesis to diagnose down syndrome prenatally roughly three months after a fetus is conceived through thousands of karyotypes on normal individuals cytologists have verified that the cells of each species carry a distinctive diploid number of chromosomes for example mendels peas contain chromosomes in pairs in each diploid cell the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster carries chromosomes pairs macaroni wheat has pairs giant sequoia trees pairs goldfish pairs dogs pairs and people pairs differences in the size shape and number of chromosomes reflect differences in the assembled genetic material that determines what each species looks like and how it functions as these figures show the number of chromosomes does not always correlate with the size or complexity of the organism in the next section you will see that the discovery that chromosomes carry information about an individuals sex led to the realization that chromosomes carry the genes that determine all traits prenatal genetic diagnosis the availability of amniocentesis and cell free fetal dna analysis for prenatal diagnosis is intimately entwined with the personal and societal issue of abortion the large majority of amniocentesis procedures are performed with the understanding that a fetus whose genotype indicates a genetic disorder such as down syndrome will be aborted some prospective parents who are opposed to abortion still elect to undergo amniocentesis so that they can better prepare for an affected child but this is rare the ethical and political aspects of the abortion debate influence many of the practical questions underlying prenatal diagnosis for example parents must decide which genetic conditions would be sufficiently severe that they would be willing to abort the fetus from the economic point of view society must decide who should pay for prenatal diagnosis procedures in current practice the risks and costs of amniocentesis generally restrict its application to women over age or to mothers whose fetuses are at high risk for a testable genetic condition because of family history the personal and societal equations determining the frequency of prenatal testing may however need to be overhauled in the not too distant future because technological advances such as the analysis of cell free fetal dna will minimize the costs and risks with new technologies for observing chromosomes and the dna in genes modern geneticists can define an individuals genotype directly doctors can use this basic strategy to diagnose before birth whether or not a baby will be born with a genetic condition the methods first developed for prenatal diagnosis were to obtain fetal cells whose dna and chromosomes could be analyzed for genotype the most frequently used method for acquiring these cells is amniocentesis fig a to carry out this procedure a doctor inserts a needle through a pregnant womans abdominal wall into the amniotic sac in which the fetus is growing this procedure is performed about weeks after the womans last menstrual period by using ultrasound imaging to guide the location of the needle the doctor then withdraws some of the amniotic fluid in which the fetus is suspended into a syringe this fluid contains living cells called amniocytes that were shed by the fetus when placed in a culture medium these fetal cells undergo several rounds of mitosis and increase in number once enough fetal cells are available clinicians look at the chromosomes and genes in those cells in later chapters we describe techniques that allow the direct examination of the dna constituting particular disease genes amniocentesis also allows the diagnosis of down syndrome through the analysis of chromosomes by karyotyping because the risk of down syndrome increases rapidly with the age of the mother more than half the pregnant women in north america who are over the age of currently undergo amniocentesis although the goal of this karyotyping is usually to learn whether the fetus is trisomic for chromosome many other abnormalities in chromosome number or shape may show up when the karyotype is examined more recently scientists have been able to analyze the genotype of fetuses from the mothers blood bypassing the need to obtain fetal cells this procedure is made possible because the mothers blood contains cell free fetal dna fetal cells leak into the mothers bloodstream and then break down releasing their dna modern dna sequencing techniques allow geneticists not only to genotype this material for particular disease associated alleles but even to determine the fetuss entire genome sequence the analysis of fetal dna obtained from the mothers blood is still experimental but it likely will replace amniocentesis in the near future because drawing blood from the mother is inexpensive and noninvasive the normal risk of miscarriage at weeks gestation is about and amniocentesis increases that risk by about about in precedures in contrast analyzing cell free dna from the mothers blood cannot harm the fetus obtaining fetal cells by amniocentesis a physician guides the insertion of the needle into the amniotic sac aided by ultrasound imaging and extracts amniotic fluid containing fetal cells into the syringe chromosomes are cellular structures specialized for the storage and transmission of genetic material genes are located on chromosomes and travel with them during cell division and gamete formation somatic cells carry a precise number of homologous pairs of chromosomes which is characteristic of the species in diploid organisms one homolog of a pair is of maternal origin and the other paternal sex chromosomes and sex determination learning objectives predict the sex of humans with different complements of x and y chromosomes describe the basis of sex reversal in humans compare the means of sex determination in different organisms figure the x and y chromosomes determine sex in humans a this colorized micrograph shows the human x chromosome on the left and the human y on the right b children can receive only an x chromosome from their mother but they can inherit either an x or a y from their father walter s sutton a young american graduate student at columbia university in the first decade of the twentieth century was one of the earliest cytologists to realize that particular chromosomes carry the information for determining sex in one study he obtained cells from the testes of the great lubber grasshopper brachystola magna fig and followed them through the meiotic divisions that produce sperm he observed that prior to meiosis precursor cells within the testes of a great lubber grasshopper contain a total of chromosomes of these are found in matched pairs and are thus autosomes the remaining two chromosomes are unmatched he called the larger of these the x chromosome and the smaller the y chromosome after meiosis the sperm produced within these testes are of two equally prevalent types one half have a set of autosomes plus an x chromosome while the other half have a set of autosomes plus a y by comparison all of the eggs produced by females of the species carry an plus x set of chromosomes like the set found in the first class of sperm when a sperm with an x chromosome fertilizes an egg an xx female grasshopper results when a y containing sperm fuses with an egg an xy male develops sutton concluded that the x and y chromosomes determine sex figure the great lubber grasshopper in this mating pair the smaller male is astride the female several researchers studying other organisms soon verified that in many sexually reproducing species two distinct chromosomes known as the sex chromosomes provide the basis of sex determination one sex carries two copies of the same chromosome a matching pair while the other sex has one of each type of sex chromosome an unmatched pair the cells of normal human females for example contain pairs of chromosomes the two chromosomes of each pair including the sex determining x chromosomes appear to be identical in size and shape in males however one unmatched pair of chromosomes is present the larger of these is the x the smaller the y fig and fig a apart from this difference in sex chromosomes the two sexes are not distinguishable at any other pair of chromosomes thus geneticists can designate women as xx and men as xy and represent sexual reproduction as a simple cross between xx and xy if sex is an inherited trait determined by a pair of sex chromosomes that separate to different cells during gamete formation then an xx xy cross could account for both the mutual exclusion of sexes and the near ratio of males to females which are hallmark features of sex determination fig b and if chromosomes carry information defining the two contrasting sex phenotypes we can easily infer that chromosomes also carry genetic information specifying other characteristics as well in humans the sry gene determines maleness you have just seen that humans and other mammals have a pair of sex chromosomes that are identical in the xx female but different in the xy male several studies have shown that in humans it is the presence or absence of the y that actually makes the difference that is any person carrying a y chromosome will look like a male for example rare humans with two x and one y chromosome xxy are males displaying certain abnormalities collectively called klinefelter syndrome klinefelter males are typically tall thin and sterile and they sometimes show mental retardation that these individuals are males shows that two x chromosomes are insufficient for female development in the presence of a y in contrast humans carrying an x and no second sex chromosome xo are females with turner syndrome turner females are usually sterile lack secondary sexual characteristics such as pubic hair are of short stature and have folds of skin between their necks and shoulders webbed necks even though these individuals have only one x chromosome they develop as females because they have no y chromosome in researchers discovered that it is not the entire y chromosome but rather a single y chromosome specific gene called sry sex determining region of y that is the primary determinant of maleness the evidence implicating sry came from so called sex reversal the existence of xx males and xy females fig in many sex reversed xx males one of the two x chromosomes carries a portion of the y chromosome although in different xx males different portions of the y chromosome are found on the x one particular gene sry is always present sex reversed xy females in contrast always have a y chromosome lacking a functional sry gene the portion of the y chromosome containing sry is either replaced by a portion of the x chromosome or the y contains a nonfunctional mutant copy of sry fig later experiments with mice confirmed that sry indeed determines maleness these experiments are described in the fast forward box transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor sry is one of about protein coding genes on the y chromosome the two ends of the y chromosome are called the pseudoautosomal regions pars because homologous dna sequences are present at the ends of the x chromosome fig the two pars par and par together contain about genes copies of which are found on both the x and y chromosomes most of the y chromosome however is called the male specific region msy fig the functions of only some of the genes in the msy are understood the msy includes four y specific and therefore male specific genes sry and three genes required for spermatogenesis the name msy is somewhat misleading because eight of the genes in the msy also exist on the x chromosome but unlike the par genes they are not grouped together in one region of either the x or y these eight msy genes affect the functions of cells and tissues all over the body in fact several of these msy genes shared with x are essential for male viability because without the y linked copies the single gene copies on the x chromosome do not supply sufficient protein females normally express both alleles of the x linked copies of these eight genes as these genes escape a phenomenon described later in this chapter figure sex reversal sex reversed xx males have a part of the y including the sry gene on one of their x chromosomes sexreversed xy females lack sry on their y chromosome either because it has been replaced by part of the x chromosome or because it has been inactivated by mutation figure human sex chromosomes have both shared and unique genes par and par black are homologous regions of the x and y chromosomes that together contain about genes the msy region contains genes needed for maleness itself sry genes for male fertility and essential genes shared with the x required for male viability because their x linked counterparts alone do not produce enough protein includes sry male fertility genes essential genes shared with x msy region y par par par transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor genes similar to human sry have been identified on the y chromosomes of nearly all mammalian species in researchers used mouse transgenic technology to show definitively that the sry gene is the crucial determinant of maleness a transgenic mouse is one whose genome contains copies of a gene that came from another individual or even from another species such genes are called transgenes one focus of genetic engineering is technology for the manipulation and insertion of transgenes to determine if sry is sufficient to determine maleness researchers wanted to introduce copies of the mouse sry gene into the genome of chromosomally female xx mice if sry is the crucial determinant of maleness then xx mice containing an sry transgene would nevertheless be male first the scientists isolated the dna of the mouse sry gene using cloning technology to be discussed in later chapters next using a method called pronuclear injection transgenic mice were generated that contained the sry gene on one of their autosomes to perform pronuclear injection researchers collected many fertilized mouse eggs from mated females and injected the sperm or egg nucleus called a pronucleus when in the zygote with hundreds of copies of the sry gene dna fig a enzymes in the pronucleus integrated the dna into random locations in the genome fig a after the injected zygotes matured into early embryos they were implanted into surrogate mothers when the mice were born cells were taken from their tails and tested for the presence of the sry transgene using molecular biology techniques figure b shows at the right a transgenic mouse transformed with sry obtained in this study although it is chromosomally xx it is phenotypically male this result demonstrates conclusively that the sry gene alone is sufficient to determine maleness figure a using pronuclear injection to generate mice transgenic for the sry gene brigid hogan howard hughes medical institute vanderbilt university charles river laboratories figure b an xx mouse transformed with sry is phenotypically male both the transformed xx mouse at the right and its normal xy littermate at the left have normal male genitalia arrows point to the penis medical research council science source the x chromosome contains about genes most of which have nothing to do with sex they specify proteins needed by both males and females why does having an sry gene mean that you will be male and not having sry mean that you will be female approximately six weeks after fertilization sry protein activates testes development in xy or sex reversed xx embryos the embryonic testes secrete hormones that trigger the development of male sex organs and prevent the formation of female sex organs in the absence of sry protein an ovary develops instead of a testis and other female sex organs develop by default tail cells tested for presence of sry transgene

in fruit flies for example although normal females are xx and normal males xy see fig it is ultimately the number of x chromosomes and not the presence or absence of the y that determines sex the different responses of humans and drosophila to the same unusual complements of sex chromosomes table reveal that the mechanisms for sex determination differ in flies and humans xxy flies are female because they have two x chromosomes but xxy humans are male because they have a y conversely because they have one x chromosome xo flies are male while xo humans are female because they lack a y the

similarly xo but xx individuals are not females they are instead selffertilizing hermaphrodites that produce both eggs and sperm in birds and butterflies males have the matching sex chromosomes while females have an unmatched set in such species geneticists represent the sex chromosomes as zz in the male and zw in the female the sex having two different sex chromosomes is termed the heterogametic sex because it gives rise to two different types of gametes conversely the sex with two similar sex chromosomes is the homogametic sex the gametes of the heterogametic sex would contain either x or y in the case of male humans and either z or w in the case of female birds the gametes of the homogametic sex would contain only an x humans or only a z birds yet other variations include the complicated sex determination mechanisms of bees and wasps in which females are diploid and males haploid and the systems of certain fish in which sex is determined by changes in the environment such as fluctuations in temperature table summarizes some of the astonishing variety in the ways that different species have solved the problem of assigning sex to individuals in spite of these many differences between species early researchers concluded that chromosomes can carry the genetic information specifying sexual characteristics and probably many other traits as well sutton and other early adherents of the chromosome theory realized that the perpetuation of life itself therefore depends on the proper distribution of chromosomes during cell division in the next sections you will see that the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis is exactly that expected of cellular structures carrying genes many sexually reproducing organisms have sex chromosomes that are sex specific and that determine sex in humans male sex determination is triggered by a y linked gene called sry female sex determination occurs in xx embryos by default mechanisms of sex determination vary remarkably in some species sex is determined by environmental factors rather than by specific chromosomes mitosis cell division that preserves chromosome number learning objectives describe the key chromosome behaviors during mitosis diagram the forces and structures that dictate chromosomal movement during mitosis the fertilized human egg is a single diploid cell that preserves its genetic identity unchanged through more than generations of cells as it divides again and again to produce a full term infant ready to be born as the newborn infant develops into a toddler a teenager and an adult yet more cell divisions fuel continued growth and maturation mitosis the nuclear division that apportions chromosomes in equal fashion to two daughter cells is the cellular mechanism that preserves genetic information through all these generations of cells in this section we take a close look at how the nuclear division of mitosis fits into the overall scheme of cell growth and division if you were to peer through a microscope and follow the history of one cell through time you would see that for much of your observation the chromosomes resemble a mass of extremely fine tangled string called chromatin surrounded by the nuclear envelope each convoluted thread of chromatin is composed mainly of dna which carries the genetic information and protein which serves as a scaffold for packaging and managing that information as described in chapter you would also be able to distinguish one or two darker areas of chromatin called nucleoli singular nucleolus literally small nucleus nucleoli play a key role in the manufacture of ribosomes organelles that function in protein synthesis during the period between cell divisions the chromatin laden nucleus houses a great deal of invisible activity necessary for the growth and survival of the cell one particularly important part of this activity is the accurate duplication of all the chromosomal material with continued vigilance you would observe a dramatic change in the nuclear landscape during one very short period in the cells life history the chromatin condenses into discrete threads and then each chromosome compacts even further into the twin rods clamped together at their centromeres that can be identified in karyotype analysis review fig each rod in a duo is called a chromatid as described earlier it is an exact duplicate of the other sister chromatid to which it is connected continued observation would reveal the doubled chromosomes beginning to jostle around inside the cell eventually lining up at the cells midplane at this point the sister chromatids of each chromosome separate to opposite poles of the now elongating cell where they become identical sets of chromosomes each of the two identical sets eventually ends up enclosed in a separate nucleus in a separate cell the two cells known as daughter cells are thus genetically identical the repeating pattern of cell growth an increase in size followed by division the splitting of one cell into two is called the cell cycle fig only a small part of the cell cycle is spent in division or m phase the period between divisions is called interphase during interphase cells grow and replicate their chromosomes interphase consists of three parts gap g synthesis s and gap g fig g lasts from the birth of a new cell to the onset of chromosome replication for the genetic material it is a period when the chromosomes are neither duplicating nor dividing during this time the cell achieves most of its growth by using the information from its genes to make and assemble the materials it needs to function normally g varies in length more than any other phase of the cell cycle in rapidly dividing cells of the human embryo for example g is as short as a few hours in contrast mature brain cells become arrested in a resting form of g known as g and do not normally divide again during a persons lifetime synthesis s is the time when the cell duplicates its genetic material by synthesizing dna during duplication each chromosome doubles to produce identical sister chromatids that will become visible when the chromosomes condense at the beginning of mitosis the two sister chromatids remain joined to each other at their centromeres note that this joined structure is considered a single chromosome as long as the connection between sister chromatids is maintained the replication of chromosomes during s phase is crucial the genetic material must be copied exactly so that both daughter cells receive identical sets of chromosomes gap g is the interval between chromosome duplication and the beginning of mitosis during this time the cell may grow usually less than during g it also synthesizes proteins that are essential to the subsequent steps of mitosis itself in addition during interphase an array of fine microtubules crucial for many biochemical processes becomes visible outside the nucleus the microtubules radiate out into the cytoplasm from a single organizing center known as the centrosome usually located near the nuclear envelope in animal cells the discernible core of each centrosome is a pair of small darkly staining bodies called centrioles fig a the microtubule organizing center of plants does not contain centrioles during the s and g stages of interphase the centrosomes replicate producing two centrosomes that remain in extremely close proximity figure the cell cycle an alternation between interphase and mitosis a chromosomes replicate to form sister chromatids during synthesis s phase the sister chromatids segregate to daughter cells during mitosis m phase the gaps between the s and m phases during which most cell growth takes place are called the g and g phases in multicellular organisms some terminally differentiated cells stop dividing and arrest in a g stage b interphase consists of the g s and g phases together during mitosis sister chromatids separate and two daughter nuclei form although the rigorously choreographed events of nuclear and cellular division occur as a dynamic and continuous process scientists traditionally analyze the process in separate stages marked by visible cytological events the artists sketches in fig illustrate these stages in the nematode ascaris whose diploid cells contain only four chromosomes two pairs of homologous chromosomes prophase chromosomes condense fig a during all of interphase the cell nucleus remains intact and the chromosomes are indistinguishable aggregates of chromatin at prophase from the greek pro meaning before the gradual emergence or condensation of individual chromosomes from the undifferentiated mass of chromatin marks the beginning of mitosis each condensing chromosome has already been duplicated during interphase and thus consists of sister chromatids attached at their centromeres at this stage in ascaris cells therefore four chromosomes exist with a total of eight chromatids the progressive appearance of an array of individual chromosomes is a truly impressive event interphase dna molecules as long as cm condense into discrete chromosomes whose length is measured in microns millionths of a meter this process is equivalent to compacting a m length of thin string as long as two football fields into a cylinder mm long and mm wide another visible change in chromatin also takes place during prophase the darkly staining nucleoli begin to break down and disappear as a result the manufacture of ribosomes ceases providing one indication that general cellular metabolism shuts down so that the cell can focus its energy on chromosome movements and cellular division several important events that characterize prophase occur outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm the centrosomes which replicated during interphase now move apart and become clearly distinguishable as two separate entities in the light microscope at the same time the interphase scaffolding of long stable microtubules disappears and is replaced by a set of dynamic microtubules that rapidly grow from and shrink back toward their centrosomal organizing centers the centrosomes continue to move apart migrating around the nuclear envelope toward opposite ends of the nucleus apparently propelled by forces exerted between interdigitated microtubules extending from the two centrosomes prometaphase the spindle forms fig b prometaphase before middle stage begins with the breakdown of the nuclear envelope which allows microtubules extending from the two centrosomes to invade the nucleus chromosomes attach to these microtubules through the kinetochore a structure in the centromere region of each chromatid that is specialized for conveyance each kinetochore contains proteins that act as molecular motors enabling the chromosome to slide along the microtubule when the kinetochore of a chromatid originally contacts a microtubule at prometaphase the kinetochore based motor moves the entire chromosome toward the centrosome from which that microtubule radiates microtubules growing from the two centrosomes capture chromosomes by connecting first to the kinetochore of one of the two sister chromatids chosen at random as a result it is sometimes possible to observe groups of chromosomes congregating in the vicinity of each centrosome in this early part of prometaphase for each chromosome one chromatids kinetochore is attached to a microtubule but the sister chromatids kinetochore remains unattached during prometaphase three different types of microtubule fibers together form the mitotic spindle all of these microtubule classes originate from the centrosomes which function as the two poles of the spindle apparatus microtubules that extend between a centrosome and the kinetochore of a chromatid are called kinetochore microtubules or centromeric fibers microtubules from each centrosome that are directed toward the middle of the cell are polar microtubules polar microtubules originating in opposite centrosomes interdigitate near the cells equator finally short astral microtubules extend out from the centrosome toward the cells periphery soon before the end of prometaphase the kinetochore of each chromosomes previously unattached sister chromatid now associates with microtubules extending from the opposite centrosome this event orients each chromosome such that one sister chromatid faces one pole of the cell and the other faces the opposite pole experimental manipulation has shown that if both kinetochores become attached to microtubules from the same pole the configuration is unstable one of the kinetochores will detach repeatedly from the spindle until it associates with microtubules from the other pole the attachment of sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles is the only stable arrangement metaphase chromosomes align at the cells equator fig c during metaphase middle stage the connection of sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles sets in motion a series of jostling movements that cause the chromosomes to move toward an imaginary equator halfway between the two poles the imaginary midline is called the metaphase plate when the chromosomes are aligned along it the forces pulling sister chromatids toward opposite poles are in a balanced equilibrium maintained by tension across the chromosomes tension results from the fact that the sister chromatids are pulled in opposite directions while they are still connected to each other by the tight cohesion of their centromeres tension compensates for any chance movement away from the metaphase plate by restoring the chromosome to its position equidistant between the poles anaphase sister chromatids move to opposite spindle poles fig d the nearly simultaneous severing of the centromeric connections between the sister chromatids of all chromosomes indicates that anaphase from the greek ana meaning up as in up toward the poles is underway the separation of sister chromatids allows each chromatid to be pulled toward the spindle pole to which it is linked by kinetochore microtubules as the chromatid moves toward the pole its kinetochore microtubules shorten because the arms of the chromatids lag behind the kinetochores metacentric chromatids have a characteristic v shape during anaphase the attachment of sister chromatids to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles means that the genetic information migrating toward one pole is exactly the same as its counterpart moving toward the opposite pole telophase identical sets of chromosomes are enclosed in two nuclei fig e the final transformation of chromosomes and the nucleus during mitosis happens at telophase from the greek telomeaning end telophase is like a rewind of prophase the spindle fibers begin to disperse a nuclear envelope forms around the group of chromatids at each pole and one or more nucleoli reappear the former chromatids now function as independent chromosomes which decondense uncoil and dissolve into a tangled mass of chromatin mitosis the division of one nucleus into two identical nuclei is over cytokinesis the cytoplasm divides fig f in the final stage of cell division the daughter nuclei emerging at the end of telophase are packaged into two separate daughter cells this final stage of division is called cytokinesis literally cell movement during cytokinesis the elongated parent cell separates into two smaller independent daughter cells with identical nuclei cytokinesis usually begins during anaphase but it is not completed until after telophase the mechanism by which cells accomplish cytokinesis differs in animals and plants in animal cells cytoplasmic division depends on a contractile ring that pinches the cell into two approximately equal halves similar to the way the pulling of a string closes the opening of a bag of marbles fig a intriguingly some types of molecules that form the contractile ring also participate in the mechanism responsible for muscle contraction in plants whose cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall a membrane enclosed disk known as the cell plate forms inside the cell near the equator and then grows rapidly outward thereby dividing the cell in two fig b during cytokinesis a large number of important organelles and other cellular components including ribosomes mitochondria membranous structures such as golgi bodies and in plants chloroplasts must be parceled out to the emerging daughter cells the mechanism accomplishing this task does not appear to predetermine which organelle is destined for which daughter cell instead because most cells contain many copies of these cytoplasmic structures each new cell is bound to receive at least a few representatives of each component this original complement of structures is enough to sustain the cell until synthetic activity can repopulate the cytoplasm with organelles sometimes cytoplasmic division does not immediately follow nuclear division and the result is a cell containing more than one nucleus an animal cell with two or more nuclei is known as a syncytium the early embryos of fruit flies are multinucleated syncytia fig as are the precursors of spermatozoa in humans and many other animals a multinucleate plant tissue is called a coenocyte coconut milk is a nutrient rich

contain many nuclei in fertilized drosophila eggs rounds of mitosis take place without cytokinesis the result is a single celled syncytial embryo that contains several thousand nuclei the photograph shows part of an embryo with dividing nuclei chromosomes are in red and spindle fibers are in green nuclei at the upper left are in metaphase while nuclei toward the bottom right are progressively later in anaphase membranes eventually grow around these nuclei dividing the embryo into cells dr byron williams cornell university figure checkpoints help regulate the cell cycle cellular checkpoints red wedges ensure that important events in the cell cycle occur in the proper sequence at each checkpoint the cell determines whether prior events have been completed before it can proceed to the next step of the cell cycle for simplicity we show only two chromosomes per cell metaphase anaphase telophase and cytokinesis interphase ongoing protein synthesis and cell growth have all chromosomes arrived and aligned at the metaphase plate then initiate anaphase have the chromosomes been completely duplicated then enter mitosis is cell of su cient size have proper signals been received then duplicate chromosomes and centrosomes chromosome and centrosome duplication regulatory checkpoints ensure correct chromosome separation the cell cycle is a complex sequence of precisely coordinated events in higher organisms a cells decision to divide depends on both intrinsic factors such as conditions within the cell that register a sufficient size for division and signals from the environment such as hormonal cues or contacts with neighboring cells that encourage or restrain division once a cell has initiated events leading to division usually during the g period of interphase everything else follows like clockwork a number of checkpoints moments at which the cell evaluates the results of previous steps allow the sequential coordination of cell cycle events fig for example the enzymes operating in one type of checkpoint monitor dna replication to ensure that cells do not begin mitosis until all the chromosomes have been completely copied if this checkpoint did not exist at least one of the daughter cells would lose dna every cell cycle in a second illustration of the molecular basis of checkpoints even a single kinetochore that has not attached to spindle fibers generates a molecular signal that prevents the sister chromatids of all chromosomes from separating at their centromeres this signal makes the beginning of anaphase dependent on the prior proper alignment of all the chromosomes at metaphase as a result of this cell cycle checkpoint each daughter cell reliably receives the right number of chromosomes breakdown of the mitotic machinery can produce division mistakes that have crucial consequences for the cell improper chromosome segregation for example can cause serious malfunction or even the death of daughter cells gene mutations that disrupt mitotic structures such as the spindle kinetochores or centrosomes are one source of improper segregation other problems occur in cells where the normal restraints on cell division such as checkpoints have broken down such cells may divide uncontrollably leading to a tumor we present the details of cell cycle regulation checkpoint controls and cancer formation in chapter through mitosis diploid cells produce identical diploid progeny cells at metaphase the sister chromatids are being pulled at their kinetochores toward opposite spindle poles these poleward forces are balanced because the chromatids are connected at their centromeres at the beginning of anaphase the connections between sister centromeres are severed so sister chromatids separate and move to opposite spindle poles cell cycle checkpoints help ensure correct duplication and separation of chromosomes meiosis cell divisions that halve chromosome number learning objectives describe the key chromosome behaviors during meiosis that lead to haploid gametes compare chromosome behaviors during mitosis and meiosis explain how the independent alignment of homologs and also crossing over during the first meiotic division each contribute to the genetic diversity of gametes during the many rounds of cell division within an embryo most cells either grow and divide via the mitotic cell cycle just described or they stop growing and become arrested in g these mitotically dividing and g arrested cells are the so called somatic cells whose descendants continue to make up the vast majority of each organisms tissues throughout the lifetime of the individual early in the embryonic development of animals however a group of cells is set aside for a different fate these are the germ cells cells destined for a specialized role in the production of gametes germ cells arise later in plants during floral development instead of during embryogenesis the germ cells become incorporated in the reproductive organs ovaries and testes in animals ovaries and anthers in flowering plants where they ultimately undergo meiosis the special two part cell division that produces gametes eggs and sperm containing half the number of chromosomes other body cells have figure an overview of meiosis the chromosomes replicate once while the nuclei divide twice in this figure all four chromatids of each chromosome pair are shown in the same shade of the same color note that the chromosomes duplicate before meiosis i but they do not duplicate between meiosis i and meiosis ii chromosomes duplicate meiosis meiosis no duplication no duplication the union of haploid gametes at fertilization yields diploid offspring that carry the combined genetic heritage of two parents sexual reproduction therefore requires the alternation of haploid and diploid generations of cells if gametes were diploid rather than haploid the number of chromosomes would double in each successive generation in humans for example the children would have chromosomes per cell the grandchildren and so on meiosis prevents this lethal exponential accumulation of chromosomes in meiosis the chromosomes replicate once but the nucleus divides twice unlike mitosis meiosis consists of two successive nuclear divisions logically named division i of meiosis and division ii of meiosis or simply meiosis i and meiosis ii with each round the cell passes through a prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase in meiosis i the parent nucleus divides to form two daughter nuclei in meiosis ii each of the two daughter nuclei divides resulting in four nuclei fig these four nuclei the final products of meiosis become partitioned in four separate daughter cells because cytokinesis occurs after both rounds of division the chromosomes duplicate at the start of meiosis i but they do not duplicate in meiosis ii which explains why the gametes contain half the number of chromosomes found in somatic cells a close look at each round of meiotic division reveals the mechanisms by which each gamete comes to receive one full haploid set of chromosomes during meiosis i homologs pair exchange parts and then segregate the events of meiosis i are unique among nuclear divisions fig meiosis i the process begins with the replication meiosis one diploid cell produces four haploid cells prophase i leptotene chromosomes thicken and become visible but the chromatids remain invisible centrosomes begin to move toward opposite poles anaphase i sister centromeres remain connected to each other the chiasmata dissolve homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles metaphase i tetrads line up along the metaphase plate each chromosome of a homologous pair attaches to fibers from opposite poles sister chromatids attach to fibers from the same pole prophase i zygotene homologous chromosomes enter synapsis the synaptonemal complex forms prophase i pachytene synapsis is complete crossing over genetic exchange between nonsister chromatids of a homologous pair occurs meiosis i a reductional division to aid visualization of the chromosomes the figure is simplified in two ways the nuclear envelope is not shown during prophase of either meiotic division the chromosomes are shown as fully condensed at zygotene in reality full condensation is not achieved until diakinesis prophase i diplotene synaptonemal complex dissolves a tetrad of four chromatids is visible crossover points appear as chiasmata holding nonsister chromatids together meiotic arrest occurs at this time in many species prophase i diakinesis chromatids thicken and shorten at the end of prophase i the nuclear membrane not shown earlier breaks down and the spindle begins to form telophase i the nuclear envelope re forms resultant cells have half the number of chromosomes each consisting of two sister chromatids cytokinesis separates the daughter cells not shown interkinesis this is similar to interphase with one important exception no chromosomal duplication takes place in some species the chromosomes decondense in others they do not telophase ii chromosomes begin to uncoil nuclear envelopes and nucleoli not shown re form cytokinesis the cytoplasm divides forming four new haploid cells metaphase i tetrads line up along the metaphase plate each chromosome of a homologous pair attaches to fibers from opposite poles sister chromatids attach to fibers from the same pole prophase i zygotene homologous chromosomes enter synapsis the synaptonemal complex forms prophase i pachytene synapsis is complete crossing over genetic exchange between nonsister chromatids of a homologous pair occurs meiosis i a reductional division metaphase ii chromosomes align at the metaphase plate sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles prophase ii chromosomes condense centrioles move toward the poles the nuclear envelope breaks down at the end of prophase ii not shown meiosis ii an equational division anaphase ii sister centromeres detach from each other allowing sister chromatids to move to opposite poles of chromosomes after which each one consists of two sister chromatids a key to understanding meiosis i is the observation that the centromeres of these sister chromatids remain connected throughout the entire division rather than separating from each other as in mitosis as meiosis i proceeds homologous chromosomes align across the cellular equator to form a coupling that ensures proper chromosome segregation later in the division moreover during the time homologous chromosomes face each other across the equator the maternal and paternal chromosomes of each homologous pair may exchange parts creating new combinations of alleles at different genes along the chromosomes afterward the two homologous chromosomes each still consisting of two sister chromatids connected at their centromeres are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle as a result it is homologous chromosomes rather than sister chromatids as in mitosis that segregate into different daughter cells at the conclusion of the first meiotic division with this overview in mind let us take a closer look at the specific events of meiosis i remembering that we analyze a dynamic flowing sequence of cellular events by breaking it down somewhat arbitrarily into the easily pictured traditional phases prophase i homologs condense and pair and crossing over occurs among the crucial events of prophase i are the condensation of chromatin the pairing of homologous chromosomes and the reciprocal exchange of genetic information between these paired homologs figure shows a generalized view of prophase i however research suggests that the exact sequence of events may vary in different species these complicated processes can take many days months or even years to complete for example in the female germ cells of several species including humans meiosis is suspended at prophase i for many years until ovulation as will be discussed further in section leptotene from the greek for thin and delicate is the first definable substage of prophase i the time when the long thin chromosomes begin to thicken see fig a for a more detailed view each chromosome has already duplicated prior to prophase i as in mitosis and thus consists of two sister chromatids affixed at their centromeres at this point however these sister chromatids are so tightly bound together that they are not yet visible as separate entities zygotene from the greek for conjugation begins as each chromosome seeks out its homologous partner and the matching chromosomes become zipped together in a prophase i of meiosis at very high magnification a leptotene threadlike chromosomes begin to condense and thicken becoming visible as discrete structures although the chromosomes have duplicated the sister chromatids of each chromosome are not yet visible in the microscope b zygotene chromosomes are clearly visible and begin pairing with homologous chromosomes along the synaptonemal complex to form a bivalent or tetrad c pachytene full synapsis of homologs recombination nodules appear along the synaptonemal complex d diplotene bivalent pulls apart slightly but homologous chromosomes remain connected due to recombination at crossover sites chiasmata e diakinesis further condensation of the bivalent homologous chromosomes synaptonemal complex synaptonemal complex recombination nodules sister chromatid sister chromatid sister chromatid sister chromatid diplotene bivalent pulls apart slightly but homologous chromosomes remain connected due to recombination at crossover sites chiasmata e diakinesis further condensation of the bivalent process known as synapsis the zipper itself is an elaborate protein structure called the synaptonemal complex that aligns the homologs with remarkable precision juxtaposing the corresponding genetic regions of the chromosome pair fig b pachytene from the greek for thick or fat begins at the completion of synapsis when homologous chromosomes are united along their length each synapsed chromosome pair is known as a bivalent because it encompasses two chromosomes or a tetrad because it contains four chromatids on one side of the bivalent is a maternally derived chromosome on the other side a paternally derived one because x and y chromosomes are not identical they do not synapse completely however the pseudoautosomal regions previously shown in fig provide small stretches of similarity between the x and the y chromosomes that allow them to pair with each other during meiosis i in males during pachytene structures called recombination nodules begin to appear along the synaptonemal complex and an exchange of parts between nonsister that is between maternal and paternal chromatids occurs at these nodules see fig c for details such an exchange is known as crossing over it results in the recombination of genetic material as a result of crossing over chromatids may no longer be of purely maternal or paternal origin however no genetic information is gained or lost so all chromatids retain their original size diplotene from the greek for twofold or double is signaled by the gradual dissolution of the synaptonemal zipper complex and a slight separation of regions of the homologous chromosomes see fig d the aligned homologous chromosomes of each bivalent nonetheless remain very tightly merged at intervals along their length called chiasmata singular chiasma which represent the sites where crossing over occurred diakinesis from the greek for double movement is accompanied by further condensation of the chromatids because of this chromatid thickening and shortening it can now clearly be seen that each tetrad consists of four separate chromatids or viewed in another way that the two homologous chromosomes of a bivalent are each composed of two sister chromatids held together at their centromeres see fig e nonsister chromatids that have undergone crossing over remain closely associated at chiasmata the end of diakinesis is analogous to the prometaphase of mitosis the nuclear envelope breaks down and the microtubules of the spindle apparatus begin to form metaphase i paired homologs attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during mitosis each sister chromatid has a kinetochore that becomes attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles during meiosis i the situation is different the kinetochores of sister chromatids fuse so that each chromosome contains only a single functional kinetochore during metaphase i see fig meiosis i it is the kinetochores of homologous chromosomes that attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles as a result in chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate the kinetochores of maternally and paternally derived chromosomes are subject to pulling forces from opposite spindle poles balanced by the physical connections between homologs at chiasmata each bivalents alignment and hookup is independent of that of every other bivalent so the chromosomes facing each pole are a random mix of maternal and paternal origin anaphase i homologs move to opposite spindle poles at the onset of anaphase i the chiasmata joining homologous chromosomes dissolve which allows the maternal and paternal homologs to begin to move toward opposite spindle poles see fig meiosis i note that in anaphase of the first meiotic division the sister centromeres do not separate as they do in mitosis thus from each homologous pair one chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids joined at their centromeres segregates to each spindle pole recombination through crossing over plays an important role in the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division the chiasmata hold the homologs together and thus ensure that their kinetochores remain attached to opposite spindle poles throughout metaphase when recombination does not occur within a bivalent mistakes in hookup and conveyance may cause homologous chromosomes to move to the same pole instead of segregating to opposite poles in some organisms however proper segregation of nonrecombinant chromosomes nonetheless occurs through other pairing mechanisms investigators do not yet completely understand the nature of these processes and they are currently evaluating several models to explain them telophase i nuclear envelopes re form the telophase of the first meiotic division or telophase i takes place when nuclear membranes begin to form around the chromosomes that have moved to the poles each of the incipient daughter nuclei contains one half the number of chromosomes in the original parent nucleus but each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at their centromeres see fig meiosis i because the number of chromosomes is reduced to one half the normal diploid number meiosis i is often called a reductional division in most species cytokinesis follows telophase i with daughter nuclei becoming enclosed in separate daughter cells a short interphase then ensues during this time the chromosomes usually decondense in which case they must recondense during the prophase of the subsequent second meiotic division in some species however the chromosomes simply stay condensed most importantly no s phase exists during the interphase between meiosis i and meiosis ii that is the chromosomes do not replicate during meiotic interphase the relatively brief interphase between meiosis i and meiosis ii is known as interkinesis during meiosis ii sister chromatids separate to produce haploid gametes the second meiotic division meiosis ii proceeds in a fashion very similar to that of mitosis but because the number of chromosomes in each dividing nucleus has already been reduced by half the resulting daughter cells are haploid the same process occurs in each of the two daughter cells generated by meiosis i producing four haploid cells at the end of this second meiotic round see fig meiosis ii prophase ii the chromosomes condense if the chromosomes decondensed during the preceding interphase they recondense during prophase ii at the end of prophase ii the nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle apparatus re forms metaphase ii chromosomes align at the metaphase plate the kinetochores of sister chromatids attach to microtubule fibers emanating from opposite poles of the spindle apparatus just as in mitotic metaphase nonetheless two significant features of metaphase ii distinguish it from mitosis first the number of chromosomes is one half that in mitotic metaphase of the same species second in most chromosomes the two sister chromatids are no longer strictly identical because of the recombination through crossing over that occurred during meiosis i the sister chromatids still contain the same genes but they may carry different combinations of alleles anaphase ii sister chromatids move to opposite spindle poles just as in mitosis severing of the connection between sister centromeres allows the sister chromatids to move toward opposite spindle poles during anaphase ii telophase ii nuclear membranes re form and cytokinesis follows membranes form around each of four daughter nuclei in telophase ii and cytokinesis places each nucleus in a separate cell the result is four haploid gametes note that at the end of meiosis ii each daughter cell that is each gamete has the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell present at the beginning of this division for this reason meiosis ii is termed an equational division mistakes in meiosis produce defective gametes segregational errors during either meiotic division can lead to aberrations such as trisomies in the next generation if for example the homologs of a chromosome pair do not segregate during meiosis i a mistake known as nondisjunction they may travel together to the same pole and eventually become part of the same gamete such an error may at fertilization result in any one of a large variety of possible trisomies most autosomal trisomies in humans as we already mentioned are lethal in utero one exception is trisomy the genetic basis of down syndrome like trisomy extra sex chromosomes may also be viable but cause a variety of mental and physical abnormalities such as those seen in klinefelter syndrome see table meiosis contributes to genetic diversity the wider the assortment of different gene combinations among members of a species the greater the chance that at least some individuals will carry combinations of alleles that allow survival in a changing environment two aspects of meiosis contribute to genetic diversity in a population first because only chance governs which paternal or maternal homologs migrate to the two poles during the first meiotic division different gametes carry a different mix of maternal and paternal chromosomes figure a shows how different patterns of homolog migration produce different mixes of parental chromosomes in the gametes the amount of potential variation generated by this random independent assortment increases with the number of chromosomes in ascaris for example where n the chromosome complement shown in fig a the random assortment of homologs could produce only or four types of gametes in a human being however where n this mechanism alone could generate or more than million genetically different kinds of gametes a second feature of meiosis the reshuffling of genetic information through crossing over during prophase i ensures an even greater amount of genetic diversity in gametes because crossing over recombines maternally and paternally derived genes each chromosome in each different gamete could consist of different combinations of maternal and paternal alleles fig b of course sexual reproduction adds yet another means of producing genetic diversity at fertilization any one of a vast number of genetically diverse sperm can fertilize an egg with its own distinctive genetic constitution it is thus not very surprising that with the exception of identical twins the billion people in the world are each genetically unique figure how meiosis contributes to genetic diversity a the variation resulting from the independent assortment of nonhomologous chromosomes increases with the number of chromosomes in the genome b crossing over between homologous chromosomes ensures that each gamete is unique metaphase ii metaphase i metaphase i metaphase ii telophase i telophase ii gametes prophase i meiosis ii meiosis i orientation i orientation ii a independent assortment b recombination mitosis and meiosis a comparison mitosis occurs in all types of eukaryotic cells that is cells with a membrane bounded nucleus and is a conservative mechanism that preserves the genetic status quo mitosis followed by cytokinesis produces growth by increasing the number of cells it also promotes the continual replacement of roots stems and leaves in plants and the regeneration of blood cells intestinal tissues and skin in animals meiosis on the other hand occurs only in sexually reproducing organisms in just a few specialized germ cells within the reproductive organs that produce haploid gametes it is not a conservative mechanism rather the extensive combinatorial changes arising from meiosis are one source of the genetic variation that fuels evolution table illustrates the significant contrasts between the two mechanisms of cell division in meiosis chromosomes replicate once before meiosis i but the nucleus divides twice meiosis i and ii during metaphase i homologous chromosomes connect to opposite spindle poles the independent alignment of each pair of homologs ensures the independent assortment of genes carried on different chromosomes crossing over during the first meiotic division maintains the connection between homologous chromosomes until anaphase i and contributes to the genetic diversity of gametes sister chromatids separate from each other during meiosis ii so that gametes have only one copy of each chromosome fertilization the union of egg and sperm restores the diploid number of chromosomes n to the zygote errors during meiosis may produce gametes with missing or extra chromosomes which often is lethal to offspring gametogenesis learning objectives compare the processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis in humans distinguish between the sex chromosome complements of human female and male germ line cells at different stages of gametogenesis in all sexually reproducing animals the embryonic germ cells collectively known as the germ line undergo a series of mitotic divisions that yield a collection of specialized diploid cells which subsequently divide by meiosis to produce haploid cells as with other biological processes many variations on this general pattern have been observed in some species the haploid cells resulting from meiosis are the gametes themselves while in other species those cells must undergo a specific plan of differentiation to fulfill that function moreover in certain organisms the four haploid products of a single meiosis do not all become gametes gamete formation or gametogenesis thus gives rise to haploid gametes marked not only by the events of meiosis per se but also by cellular events that precede and follow meiosis here we illustrate gametogenesis with a description of egg and sperm formation in humans the details of gamete formation in several other organisms appear throughout the book in discussions of specific experimental studies haploid and diploid cells can undergo mitosis one round of division mitosis is preceded by s phase chromosome duplication chromosomes duplicate prior to meiosis i but not before meiosis ii occurs in germ cells as part of the sexual cycle two rounds of division meiosis i and meiosis ii only diploid cells undergo meiosis interkinesis gamete formation g s g meiosis ii n n n n n n n n mitosis meiosis i meiosis ii mitosis produces two new daughter cells identical to each other and the original cell mitosis is thus genetically conservative meiosis produces four haploid cells one egg or all sperm of which can become gametes none of these is identical to each other or to the original cell because meiosis results in combinatorial change during prophase of meiosis i homologous chromosomes pair synapse along their length crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes during prophase of meiosis i homologous chromosomes not sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during metaphase i the centromeres of the sister chromatids remain tightly attached during meiosis i sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during metaphase ii the centromeres of the sister chromatids separate at the beginning of anaphase ii homologous chromosomes do not pair genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes is very rare sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during metaphase the centromeres of the sister chromatids separate at the beginning of anaphase figure in humans egg formation begins in the fetal ovaries and arrests during the prophase of meiosis i fetal ovaries contain about primary oocytes arrested in the diplotene substage of meiosis i if the egg released during a menstrual cycle is fertilized meiosis is completed only one of the three cells produced by meiosis serves as the functional gamete or ovum arrest at diplotene of meiosis i oocyte grows and accumulates nutrients mitosis occurs in fetal ovary meiosis i asymmetrical division completed at ovulation meiosis ii asymmetrical division completed only after fertilization oogonia arrested primary oocyte secondary oocyte first polar body second polar body mature ovum ovarian ligament primary oocyte within primary follicle developing follicle with primary oocyte mature follicle with secondary oocyte ruptured follicle released secondary oocyte oogenesis in humans produces one ovum from each primary oocyte the end product of egg formation in humans is a large nutrient rich ovum whose stored resources can sustain the early embryo the process known as oogenesis fig begins when diploid germ cells in the ovary called oogonia singular oogonium multiply rapidly by mitosis and produce a large number of primary oocytes which then undergo meiosis for each primary oocyte meiosis i results in the formation of two daughter cells that differ in size so this division is asymmetric the larger of these cells the secondary oocyte receives over of the cytoplasm the other small sister cell is known as the first polar body during meiosis ii the secondary oocyte undergoes another asymmetrical division to produce a large haploid ovum and a small haploid second polar body the first polar body usually arrests its development the two small polar bodies apparently serve no function and disintegrate leaving one large haploid ovum as the functional gamete thus only one of the three or rarely four products of a single meiosis serves as a female gamete a normal human ovum carries autosomes and an x sex chromosome oogenesis begins in the fetus by six months after conception the fetal ovaries are fully formed and contain about half a million primary oocytes arrested in the diplotene substage of prophase i these cells with their homologous chromosomes locked in synapsis were thought for decades to be the only oocytes the female will produce if so a girl is born with all the oocytes she will ever possess remarkably recent research has brought this long held theory into question scientists have shown that germ line precursor cells removed from adult ovaries can produce new eggs in a petri dish however it is not yet known whether these eggs are viable nor if these germ line cells normally produce eggs in adults from the onset of puberty at about age until menopause some years later most women release one primary oocyte each month from alternate ovaries amounting to roughly oocytes released during the reproductive years the remaining primary oocytes disintegrate during menopause at ovulation a released oocyte completes meiosis i and proceeds as far as the metaphase of meiosis ii if the oocyte is then fertilized that is penetrated by a sperm nucleus it quickly completes meiosis ii the nuclear membranes of the sperm and ovum dissolve allowing their chromosomes to form the single diploid nucleus of the zygote and the zygote divides by mitosis to produce a functional embryo in contrast unfertilized oocytes exit the body during the menses stage of the menstrual cycle the long interval before completion of meiosis in oocytes released by women in their s s and s may contribute to the observed correlation between maternal age and meiotic segregational errors including those that produce trisomies women in their mid s for example run a very small risk of trisomy only of children born to women of this age have down syndrome during the later childbearing years however the risk rises rapidly at age it is of live births and at age it is you would not expect this age related increase in risk if meiosis were completed before the mothers birth spermatogenesis in humans produces four sperm from each primary spermatocyte the production of sperm or spermatogenesis fig begins in the male testes in germ cells known as spermatogonia mitotic divisions of the spermatogonia produce many diploid cells the primary spermatocytes unlike primary oocytes primary spermatocytes undergo a symmetrical meiosis i producing two secondary spermatocytes each of which undergoes a symmetrical meiosis ii at the conclusion of meiosis each original primary spermatocyte thus yields four equivalent haploid spermatids these spermatids then mature by developing a characteristic whiplike tail and by concentrating all their chromosomal material in a head thereby becoming functional sperm a human sperm much smaller than the ovum it will fertilize contains autosomes and either an x or a y sex chromosome the timing of sperm production differs radically from that of egg formation the meiotic divisions allowing conversion of primary spermatocytes to spermatids begin only at puberty but meiosis then continues throughout a mans life the entire process of spermatogenesis takes about days for meiosis i for meiosis ii and for the maturation of spermatids into fully functional sperm within each testis after puberty millions of sperm are always in production and a single ejaculate can contain up to million over a lifetime a man can produce billions of sperm almost equally divided between those bearing an x and those bearing a y chromosome essential concepts diploid germ cell precursors proliferate by mitosis and then undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes human females are born with oocytes arrested in prophase of meiosis i meiosis resumes at ovulation but is not completed until fertilization spermatogenesis begins at puberty and continues through the lifetimes of human males the two meiotic divisions of oogenesis are asymmetrical so a primary oocyte results in a single egg the two meiotic divisions of spermatogenesis are symmetrical so a primary spermatocyte results in four sperm all human oocytes contain a single x chromosome human sperm contain either an x or a y figure human sperm form continuously in the testes after puberty spermatogonia are located near the exterior of seminiferous tubules in a human testis once they divide to produce the primary spermatocytes the subsequent stages of spermatogenesis meiotic divisions in the spermatocytes and maturation of spermatids into sperm occur successively closer to the middle of the tubule mature sperm are released into the central lumen of the tubule for ejaculation spermatogonia spermatogonia primary spermatocyte secondary spermatocyte primary spermatocyte after chromosome duplication secondary spermatocyte sperm spermatid spermatids sperm mitosis occurs in adult testis meiosis i meiosis ii di erentiation validation of the chromosome theory learning objectives describe the key events of meiosis that explain mendels first and second laws infer from the results of crosses whether or not a trait is sex linked predict phenotypes associated with nondisjunction of sex chromosomes we have presented thus far two circumstantial lines of evidence in support of the chromosome theory of inheritance first the phenotype of sexual morphology is associated with the inheritance of particular chromosomes second the events of mitosis meiosis and gametogenesis ensure a constant number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of all members of a species over time one would expect the genetic material to exhibit this kind of stability even in organisms with very different modes of reproduction final acceptance of the chromosome theory depended on researchers going beyond the circumstantial evidence to a rigorous demonstration of two key points that the inheritance of genes corresponds with the inheritance of chromosomes in every detail and that the transmission of particular chromosomes coincides with the transmission of specific traits other than sex determination mendels laws correlate with chromosome behavior during meiosis walter sutton first outlined the chromosome theory of inheritance in building on the theoretical ideas and experimental results of theodor boveri in germany e b wilson in new york and others in a paper sutton speculated that the association of paternal and maternal chromosomes in pairs and their subsequent separation during the reducing division that is meiosis i may constitute the physical basis of the mendelian law of heredity in he suggested that chromosomes carry mendels hereditary units for the following reasons every cell contains two copies of each kind of chromosome and two copies of each kind of gene the chromosome complement like mendels genes appears unchanged as it is transmitted from parents to offspring through generations during meiosis homologous chromosomes pair and then separate to different gametes just as the alternative alleles of each gene segregate to different gametes maternal and paternal copies of each chromosome pair move to opposite spindle poles without regard to the assortment of any other homologous chromosome pair just as the alternative alleles of unrelated genes assort independently at fertilization an eggs set of chromosomes unites with a randomly encountered sperms set of chromosomes just as alleles obtained from one parent unite at random with those from the other parent in all cells derived from the fertilized egg one half of the chromosomes and one half of the genes are of maternal origin the other half of paternal origin the two parts of table show the intimate relationship between the chromosome theory of inheritance and mendels laws of segregation and independent assortment if mendels genes for pea shape and pea color are assigned to different that is nonhomologous chromosomes the behavior of chromosomes can be seen to parallel the behavior of genes walter suttons observation of these parallels led him to propose that chromosomes and genes are physically connected in some manner meiosis ensures that each gamete will contain only a single chromatid of a bivalent and thus only a single allele of any gene on that chromatid table a the independent behavior of two bivalents during meiosis means that the genes carried on different chromosomes will assort into gametes independently table b from a review of fig a which follows two different chromosome pairs through the process of meiosis you might wonder whether crossing over abolishes the clear correspondence between mendels laws and the movement of chromosomes the answer is no each chromatid of a homologous chromosome pair contains only one copy of a given gene and only one chromatid from each pair of homologs is incorporated into each gamete because alternative alleles remain on different chromatids even after crossing over has occurred alternative alleles still segregate to different gametes as demanded by mendels first law furthermore because the orientations of nonhomologous chromosomes are completely random with respect to each other during both meiotic divisions the genes on different chromosomes assort independently even if crossing over occurs as demanded by mendels second law in fig a you can see that without recombination each of the two random alignments of the nonhomologous chromosomes results in the production of only two of the four gamete types ab and ab for one orientation and ab and ab for the other orientation with recombination each of the alignments of alleles in fig a may in fact generate all four gamete types imagine a crossover switching the positions of a and a nonsister chromatids in fig a thus both the random alignment of nonhomologous chromosomes and crossing over contribute to the phenomenon of independent assortment specific traits are transmitted with specific chromosomes the fate of a theory depends on whether its predictions can be validated because genes determine traits the prediction that chromosomes carry genes could be tested by breeding experiments that would show whether transmission of a specific chromosome coincides with transmission of a specific trait cytologists knew that one pair of chromosomes the sex chromosomes determines whether an individual is male or female would similar correlations exist for other traits

one chromosome and the allele for wrinkled peas r is on the homologous chromosome the pairing between the two homologous chromosomes during prophase through metaphase of meiosis i makes sure that the homologs will separate to opposite spindle poles during anaphase i at the end of meiosis ii two types of gametes have been produced half have r and half have r but no gametes have both alleles thus the separation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis i corresponds to the segregation of alleles as the punnett square shows fertilization of r and r eggs with the same proportion of r and r sperm leads to mendels ratio in the f generation one pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed shape alleles r and r a second pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed color alleles y and y each homologous pair aligns at random at the metaphase plate during meiosis i independently of the other homologous pair thus two equally likely configurations are possible for the migration of any two chromosome pairs toward the poles during anaphase i as a result a dihybrid individual will generate four equally likely types of gametes with regard to the two traits in question the punnett square affirms that independent assortment of traits carried by nonhomologous chromosomes produces mendels ratio a gene determining eye color on the drosophila x chromosome thomas hunt morgan an american experimental biologist with training in embryology headed the research group whose findings eventually established a firm experimental base for the chromosome theory morgan chose to work with the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster because it is extremely prolific and has a very short generation time taking only days to develop from a fertilized egg into a mature adult capable of producing hundreds of offspring morgan fed his flies mashed bananas and housed them in empty milk bottles capped with wads of cotton in a white eyed male appeared among a large group of flies with brick red eyes a mutation had apparently altered a gene determining eye color changing it from the normal wild type allele specifying red to a new allele that produced white when morgan allowed the white eyed male to mate with its red eyed sisters all the flies of the f generation had red eyes the red allele was clearly dominant to the white fig cross a establishing a pattern of nomenclature for drosophila geneticists morgan named the gene identified by the abnormal white eye color the white gene for the mutation that revealed its existence the normal wild type allele of the white gene abbreviated w is for brick red eyes while the counterpart mutant w allele results in white eye color the superscript signifies the wild type by writing the gene name and abbreviation in lowercase morgan symbolized that the mutant w allele is recessive to the wild type w if a drosophila mutation results in a dominant non wild type phenotype the first letter of the gene name or of its abbreviation is capitalized thus the mutation known as bar eyes is dominant to the wild type bar allele see the appendix guidelines for gene nomenclature morgan then crossed the red eyed males of the f generation with their red eyed sisters fig cross b and obtained an f generation with the predicted ratio of red to white eyes but there was something askew in the pattern among the red eyed offspring there were two females for every one male and all the white eyed offspring were males this result was surprisingly different from the equal transmission to both sexes of the mendelian traits discussed in chapters and in these fruit flies the ratio of eye colors was not the same in male and female progeny by mating f red eyed females with their white eyed brothers fig cross c morgan obtained some females with white eyes which then allowed him to mate a white eyed female with a red eyed wild type male fig cross d the result was exclusively red eyed daughters and white eyed sons the pattern seen in cross d is known as crisscross inheritance because the males inherit their eye color from their mothers while the daughters inherit their eye color from their fathers note in fig that the results of the reciprocal crosses red female white male cross a and white female red male cross d are not identical again in contrast with mendels findings from the data morgan reasoned that the white gene for eye color is x linked that is carried by the x chromosome note that while symbols for genes and alleles are italicized symbols for chromosomes are not the y chromosome carries no allele of this gene for eye color males therefore have only one copy of the gene which they inherit from their mother along with their only x chromosome their y chromosome must come from their father thus males are hemizygous for this eye color gene because their diploid cells have half the number of alleles carried by the female on her two x chromosomes if the single white gene on the x chromosome of a male is the wild type w allele he will have red eyes and a genotype that can be written xw y here we designate the chromosome x or y together with the allele it carries to emphasize that certain genes are x linked in contrast to an xw y male a hemizygous xwy male would have white eyes females with two x chromosomes can be one of three genotypes xw xw white eyed xwxw red eyed because w is dominant to w or xw xw red eyed as shown in fig morgans assumption that the gene for eye color is x linked explains the results of his breeding experiments crisscross inheritance for example occurs because the only x chromosome in sons of a white eyed mother xwxw must carry the w allele so the sons will be white eyed in contrast because daughters of a red eyed xw y father must receive a w bearing x chromosome from their father they should all have red eyes validation of the chromosome theory from the analysis of nondisjunction although morgans work strongly supported the hypothesis that the gene for eye color lies on the x chromosome he himself continued to question the validity of the chromosome theory until calvin bridges one of his top students found another key piece of evidence bridges repeated the cross morgan had performed between white eyed females and red eyed males but this time he did the experiment on a larger scale as expected the progeny of this cross consisted mostly of red eyed females and white eyed males however about in every males had red eyes and about the same small fraction of females had white eyes figure a drosophila eye color gene

progeny of this cross consisted mostly of red eyed females and white eyed males however about in every males had red eyes and about the same small fraction of females had white eyes figure nondisjunction rare mistakes in meiosis help confirm the chromosome theory a rare events of nondisjunction in an xx female produce xx and o eggs the results of normal disjunction in the female are not shown xo males are sterile because the missing y chromosome is needed for male fertility in drosophila b in an xxy female the three sex chromosomes can pair and segregate in two ways producing progeny with unusual sex chromosome complements w a nondisjunction in an xx female b segregation in an xxy female white eyed y red eyed white eyed red eyed meiosis y o p gametes nondisjunction normal segregation y o w w red xw dies white o y dies y wy w y less frequent more frequent white w w w w w gametes w w w w w y y y w w w y y meiosis x y yy red red white dies white red dies bridges hypothesized that these exceptions arose through rare events in which the x chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis in females he called such failures in chromosome segregation nondisjunction mistakes leading to nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis i or meiosis ii but in either case nondisjunction would result in some eggs with two x chromosomes and others with none as fig a shows fertilization of these chromosomally abnormal eggs could produce four types of zygotes xxy with two x chromosomes from the egg and a y from the sperm xxx with two xs from the egg and one x from the sperm xo with the lone sex chromosome from the sperm and no sex chromosome from the egg and oy with the only sex chromosome again coming from the sperm when bridges examined the sex chromosomes of the rare white eyed females produced in his large scale cross he found that they were indeed xxy individuals who must have received two x chromosomes and with them two w alleles from their white eyed xwxw mothers the exceptional red eyed males emerging from the cross were xo their eye color showed that they must have obtained their sole sex chromosome from their xw y fathers in this study then transmission of the white gene alleles followed the predicted behavior of x chromosomes during rare meiotic mistakes indicating that the x chromosome carries the gene for eye color these results also suggested that zygotes with the two other abnormal sex chromosome karyotypes expected from nondisjunction in females xxx and oy die during embryonic development and thus produce no progeny because xxy white eyed females have three sex chromosomes rather than the normal two bridges reasoned they would produce four kinds of eggs xy and x or xx and y fig b you can visualize the formation of these four kinds of eggs by imagining that when the three chromosomes pair and disjoin during meiosis two chromosomes must go to one pole and one chromosome to the other with this kind of segregation only two results are possible either one x and the y go to one pole and the second x to the other yielding xy and x gametes or the two xs go to one pole and the y to the other yielding xx and y gametes the first of these two scenarios occurs more often because it comes about when the two similar x chromosomes pair with each other ensuring that they will go to opposite poles during the first meiotic division the second less likely possibility happens only if the two x chromosomes fail to pair with each other bridges next predicted that fertilization of these four kinds of eggs from an xxy female by normal sperm would generate an array of sex chromosome karyotypes associated with specific eye colors in the progeny bridges verified all his predictions when he analyzed the eye colors and sex chromosomes of a large number of offspring for instance he showed cytologically that all of the white eyed females emerging from the cross in fig b had two x chromosomes and one y chromosome while one half of the white eyed males had a single x chromosome and two y chromosomes bridges painstaking observations provided compelling evidence that specific genes do in fact reside on specific chromosomes the chromosome theory integrates many aspects of gene behavior mendel had assumed that genes are located in cells the chromosome theory assigned the genes to a specific kind of structure within cells and explained alternative alleles as physically matching parts of homologous chromosomes in so doing the theory provided an explanation of mendels laws the mechanism of meiosis ensures that the matching parts of homologous chromosomes will segregate to different gametes except in rare instances of nondisjunction accounting for the segregation of alleles predicted by mendels first law because each homologous chromosome pair aligns independently of all others at meiosis i genes carried on different chromosomes will assort independently as predicted by mendels second law the chromosome theory is also able to explain the creation of new alleles through mutation a spontaneous change in a particular gene that is in a particular part of a chromosome if a mutation occurs in the germ line it can be transmitted to subsequent generations finally through mitotic cell divisions in the embryo and after birth each cell in a multicellular organism receives the same chromosomes and thus the same maternal and paternal alleles of each gene as the zygote received from the egg and sperm at fertilization in this way an individuals genome the chromosomes and genes he or she carries remains constant throughout life essential concepts segregation of homologous chromosomes into daughter cells at meiosis i explains mendels first law independent alignment of homologs with respect to each other and crossing over of nonsister chromatids during meiosis i explain mendels second law in organisms with xx xy sex determination males are hemizygous for x linked genes while females have two

this vision defect figure suggests to readers with normal color vision what people with red green color blindness actually see in e b wilson a contributor to the chromosome theory of inheritance combined family studies of the inheritance of color blindness with recent knowledge of the roles of the x and y chromosomes in sex determination to make the first assignment of a human gene to a particular chromosome the gene for red green color blindness he said lies on the x because the condition usually passes from a maternal grandfather through an unaffected carrier mother to roughly of the grandsons several years after wilson made this gene assignment pedigree analysis established that various forms of hemophilia or bleeders disease in which the blood fails to clot properly also result from mutations on the x chromosome that give rise to a relatively rare recessive trait in this context rare means infrequent in the population the family histories under review including one following the descendants of queen victoria of england fig a showed that relatively rare x linked traits appear more often in males than in females and often skip generations the clues that suggest x linked recessive inheritance in a pedigree are summarized in table unlike color blindness and hemophilia some although very few of the known rare mutations on the x chromosome are dominant to the wild type allele with such dominant x linked mutations more females than males show the aberrant phenotype this phenomenon occurs because all the daughters of an affected male but none of the sons will have the condition while one half the sons and one half the daughters of an affected female will receive the dominant allele and therefore show the phenotype see table figure red green color blindness

hypophosphatemia vitamin d resistant rickets or hypophosphatemia is an example of an x linked dominant trait figure b presents the pedigree of a family affected by this disease in xx human females one x chromosome is inactivated the xx and xy system of sex determination presents human cells with a curious problem that requires a solution called dosage compensation as mentioned earlier the x chromosome contains about genes and the proteins that they specify need to be present in the same amounts in male and female cells to compensate for female cells having two copies of each x linked gene and male cells having only one xx cells inactivate one of their two x chromosomes almost all of the genes on the inactivated x chromosome are turned off so no gene products can be made x inactivation occurs at about two weeks after fertilization when an xx human embryo is composed of only cells at that time each cell chooses one x chromosome at random to condense into a so called barr body and thereby inactivate it barr bodies named after the cytologist murray barr who discovered them appear as small dark chromosomes in interphase cells treated with a dna stain that allows chromosomes to be visible under a light microscope fig each embryonic cell decides independently which x chromosome will be inactivated either the x inherited from the mother or the paternal x once the determination is made it is clonally perpetuated so that all of the millions of cells descended by mitosis from a particular embryonic cell condense the same x chromosome to a barr body fig a human females are thus a patchwork of cells some containing a maternally derived active x chromosome and the others an active paternal x fig b the fast forward box visualizing x chromosome inactivation in transgenic mice explains how scientists have recently developed technology in mice to visualize both outside and inside the body the clonal patches of cells that express the genes on one x chromosome or the other the phenomenon of x chromosome inactivation may have interesting effects on the traits controlled by x linked genes when females are heterozygous at an x linked gene parts of their bodies are in effect hemizygous for one allele and parts are hemizygous for the other allele in terms of gene function moreover which body parts are functionally hemizygous for one allele or the other is random even identical twins who have identical alleles of all of their genes will have a different pattern of x chromosome inactivation in fig b females heterozygous for the x linked recessive trait anhidrotic epidermal dysplasia have patches of skin that lack sweat glands interspersed with patches of normal skin the phenotype of a patch depends upon which x chromosome is inactivated each patch is a clone of skin cells derived from a single embryonic cell that made the decision to inactivate one of the x chromosomes in a second example women heterozygous for an x linked recessive hemophilia allele are called carriers of the disease allele even though they may have some symptoms of hemophilia the severity of the condition depends on the particular random pattern of cells that inactivated the disease allele and cells that inactivated the normal allele in chapter we discussed how chance events work through genes to affect phenotype x inactivation is a perfect example of such an event recall that the two tips of the x chromosome the pseudoautosomal regions pars contain genes also present at the tips of the y chromosome fig in order to equalize the dosage of these genes in xx and xy cells the par genes on the barr body x chromosome escape inactivation this feature of dosage compensation may explain at least in part why xxy males klinefelter syndrome and xo females turner syndrome have abnormal morphological features although one of the two x chromosomes in xxy males becomes a barr body klinefelter males have three doses rather than the normal two of the genes in the par regions the single x chromosome in xo cells does not become a barr body yet these cells have only one dose of the par genes rather than two in xx females x chromosome inactivation is common to mammals and we will present the molecular details of this process in later chapters it is nonetheless important to realize that other organisms compensate for sex chromosome differences in alternative ways fruit flies for example hyperactivate the single x chromosome in xy male cells so that most x chromosome genes produce twice as much protein product as each x chromosome in a female the nematode c elegans in contrast ratchets down the level of gene activity on each of the x chromosomes in xx hermaphrodites relative to the single x in xo males table pedigree patterns suggesting sex linked inheritance x linked recessive trait the trait appears in more males than females because a female must receive two copies of the rare defective allele to display the phenotype whereas a hemizygous male with only one copy will show it the mutation will never pass from father to son because sons receive only a y chromosome from their father an affected male passes the x linked mutation to all his daughters who are thus carriers each son of these carrier females has a onehalf chance to inherit the defective allele and thus the trait the trait often skips a generation as the mutation passes from grandfather through a carrier daughter to grandson the trait can appear in successive generations when a sister of an affected male is a carrier if she is each of her sons has a one half chance of being affected with the rare affected homozygous female all her sons will be affected and all her daughters will be carriers x linked dominant trait more females than males show the aberrant trait the trait is seen in every generation as long as affected males have female children all the daughters but none of the sons of an affected male will be affected this criterion is the most useful for distinguishing an x linked dominant trait from an autosomal dominant trait the sons and daughters of an affected female each have a one half chance of being affected for incompletely dominant x linked traits carrier females may show the trait in less extreme form than males with the defective allele y linked trait the trait is seen only in males all male descendants of an affected man will exhibit the trait not only do females not exhibit the trait they also cannot transmit it figure barr bodies are densely staining particles in xx cell nuclei

technology similar to that described in the earlier fast forward box transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor to visualize the pattern of x chromosome inactivation in mice the researchers

was a gene from red coral that makes red fluorescent protein rfp fig a in the xx mice the gfp gene is located on the x chromosome from the mother and the rfp gene resides on the x chromosome from the

chromosomes hao wu and jeremy nathans molecular biology and genetics neuroscience and hhmi johns hopkins medical school maleness and male fertility are the only known y linked traits in humans theoretically phenotypes caused by mutations on the y chromosome should also be identifiable by pedigree analysis such traits would pass from an affected father to all of his sons and from them to all future male descendants females would neither exhibit nor transmit a y linked phenotype see table however besides the determination of maleness itself as well as contributions to sperm formation and thus male fertility no clear cut y linked visible traits have turned up in humans the paucity of known ylinked traits reflects the fact that as mentioned earlier the small y chromosome contains very few genes indeed one would expect the y chromosome to have only a limited effect on phenotype because normal xx females do perfectly well without it autosomal genes contribute to sexual dimorphism not all genes that produce sexual dimorphism differences in the two sexes reside on the x or y chromosomes some autosomal genes govern traits that appear in one sex but not the other or traits that are expressed differently in the two sexes sex limited traits affect a structure or process that is found in one sex but not the other mutations in genes for sex limited traits can influence only the phenotype of the sex that expresses those structures or processes a vivid example of a sex limited trait occurs in drosophila males homozygous for an autosomal recessive mutation known as stuck which affects the ability of mutant males to retract their penis and release the claspers by which they hold on to female genitalia during copulation the mutant males have difficulty separating from females after mating in extreme cases both individuals die forever caught in their embrace because females lack penises and claspers homozygous stuck mutant females can mate normally sex influenced traits show up in both sexes but the expression of such traits may differ between the two sexes because of hormonal differences pattern baldness a condition in which hair is lost prematurely from the top of the head but not from the sides fig is a sexinfluenced trait in humans although pattern baldness is a complex trait that can be affected by many genes an autosomal gene appears to play an important role in certain families men in these families who are heterozygous for the balding allele lose their hair while still in their s whereas heterozygous women do not show any significant hair loss in contrast homozygotes in both sexes become bald though the onset of baldness in homozygous women is usually much later in life than in homozygous men this sex influenced trait is thus dominant in men recessive in women mutations in sex determination pathway genes can result in intersexuality disorders we previously saw that the sry gene on the y chromosome is essential to maleness because it initiates testis development early in embryogenesis but the functions of many genes are required for testis development or for subsequent events that rely on hormones made in the testes for the development of sexual organs some of these genes are autosomal and some are x linked in either case an xy individual with mutant alleles for any of these genes may have unusual intersexual phenotypes in one important example xy people with nonfunctional mutant alleles of the x linked ar gene specifying the androgen receptor have a disorder known as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais these xy individuals have testes that make the hormone testosterone but in the absence of the androgen receptor to which it binds the testosterone has no effect without the androgen receptor these people cannot develop male genitalia penis and scrotum nor male internal duct systems the vas deferens seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts instead their external genitalia assume the default female state labia and clitoris however the testes make another hormone that prevents the formation of female internal duct systems including the fallopian tubes uterus and vagina the result is that persons with cais are externally female but sterile because they lack the internal duct systems of either sex essential concepts sex linked x linked traits show sex specific inheritance patterns because sons always inherit their fathers y chromosome while daughters always inherit their fathers x chromosome random inactivation of either the maternal or paternal x chromosome in xx cells ensures that male and female mammalian cells express equivalent amounts of the proteins encoded by most x linked genes mutations of genes whether autosomal or x linked can have different effects in males and females figure male pattern baldness a sex influenced trait a john adams second president of the united states at about age b john quincy adams son of john adams and the sixth president of the united states at about the same age the father to son transmission suggests that male pattern baldness in the adams family is likely determined by an allele of an autosomal gene a bettmann corbis b the corcoran gallery of art corbis whats next t h morgan and his students collectively known as the drosophila group acknowledged that mendelian genetics could exist independently of chromosomes why then we are often asked do you drag in the chromosomes our answer is that because the chromosomes furnish exactly the kind of mechanism that mendelian laws call for and since there is an ever increasing body of information that points clearly to the chromosomes as the bearers of the mendelian factors it would be folly to close ones eyes to so patent a relation moreover as biologists we are interested in heredity not primarily as a mathematical formulation but rather as a problem concerning the cell the egg and the sperm the drosophila group went on to find several xlinked mutations in addition to white eyes one made the body yellow instead of brown another shortened the wings yet another made bent instead of straight body bristles these findings raised several compelling questions first if the genes for all of these traits are physically linked together on the x chromosome does this linkage affect their ability to assort independently and if so how second does each gene have an exact chromosomal address and if so does this specific location in any way affect its transmission in chapter we describe how the drosophila group and others analyzed the transmission patterns of genes on the same chromosome in terms of known chromosome movements during meiosis and how they then used the information obtained to localize genes to specific chromosomal positions solved problems in humans chromosome sometimes has a heavily stained area in the long arm near the centromere this feature can be seen through the microscope but has no effect on the phenotype of the person carrying it when such a blob exists on a particular copy of chromosome it is a constant feature of that chromosome and is inherited a couple conceived a child but the fetus had multiple abnormalities and was miscarried when the chromosomes of the fetus were studied it was discovered that it had three copies of chromosome it was trisomic for chromosome and that two of the three chromosome s had large blobs both chromosome homologs in the mother lacked blobs but the father was heterozygous for blobs which parent experienced nondisjunction and in which meiotic division did it occur answer this problem requires an understanding of nondisjunction during meiosis when individual chromosomes contain some distinguishing feature that allows one homolog to be distinguished from another it is possible to follow the path of the two homologs through meiosis because the fetus had two chromosome s with the blob we can conclude that the extra chromosome came from the father the only parent with a blobbed chromosome we know that nondisjunction must be involved because normal meiosis in the father would generate gametes with only a single chromosome with the blob as a result the fetus could have only a single chromosome with the blob meiosis i normal meiosis in father meiosis ii gametes in which meiotic division did the nondisjunction occur when nondisjunction occurs during meiosis i homologs fail to segregate to opposite poles if this occurred in the father the chromosome with the blob and the normal chromosome would segregate into the same cell a secondary spermatocyte after meiosis ii the gametes resulting from this cell would carry both types of chromosomes if such sperm fertilized a normal egg the zygote would have two copies of the normal chromosome and one copy of the chromosome with a blob on the other hand if nondisjunction occurred during meiosis ii in the father in a secondary spermatocyte containing the blobbed chromosome sperm with two copies of the blob marked chromosome would be produced after fertilization with a normal egg the result would be a zygote of the type seen in this spontaneous abortion meiosis i ndj in meiosis ii fertilization mothers gamete fathers gamete meiosis ii gametes fetus therefore the nondisjunction occurred in meiosis ii in the father ii a what sex ratio would you expect among the offspring of a cross between a normal male mouse and a female mouse heterozygous for a recessive x linked lethal gene b what would be the expected sex ratio among the offspring of a cross between a normal hen and a rooster heterozygous for a recessive z linked lethal allele answer this problem deals with sex linked inheritance and sex determination a mice have a sex determination system of xx female and xy male a normal male mouse xry a heterozygous female mouse xrxr would result in xrxr xrxr xry and xry mice the xry mice would die so there would be a ratio of females to males b the sex determination system in birds is zz male and zw

color vision whose father was color blind mates with a man with normal color vision a what do you expect to see among their offspring b what would you expect if it was the normal mans father who was color blind answer this problem involves sex linked inheritance a the womans father has a genotype of xcby because the woman had to inherit an x from her father she must have an xcb chromosome but because she has normal color vision her other x chromosome must be xcb the man she mates with has normal color vision and therefore has an xcby genotype their children could with equal probability be xcbxcb normal female xcbxcb carrier female xcby normal male or xcby color blind male b if the man with normal color vision had a color blind father the xcb chromosome would not have been passed on to him because a male does not inherit an x chromosome from his father the man has the genotype xcby and cannot pass on the color blind allele vocabulary choose the best matching phrase in the right

two assumptions i or ii is more realistic in the moss polytrichum commune the haploid chromosome number is a haploid male gamete fuses with a haploid female gamete to form a diploid cell that divides and develops into the multicellular sporophyte cells of the sporophyte then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells called spores what is the probability that an individual spore will contain a set of chromosomes all of which came from the male gamete assume that no recombination occurs can you think of anything that would prevent meiosis from occurring in an organism whose genome is always haploid sister chromatids are held together through metaphase of mitosis by complexes of cohesin proteins that form rubber band like rings bundling the two sister chromatids cohesin rings are found both at centromeres and at many locations scattered along the length of the chromosomes the rings are destroyed by protease enzymes at the beginning of mitotic anaphase allowing the sister chromatids to separate a cohesin complexes between sister chromatids are also responsible for keeping homologous chromosomes together until anaphase of meiosis i with this point in mind which of the two diagrams

cohesin complexes at the centromere versus those along the chromosome arms suggest a molecular hypothesis to explain your inference i ii the pseudoautosomal regions pars of the x and y chromosomes enable the sex chromosomes to pair and synapse during meiosis in males given the location of the sry gene near par can you propose a mechanism for how the mutant x and y chromosomes in fig in which part of the x is on the y and part of the y is on the x may have arisen during meiosis remarkably the platypus has sex chromosomes the largest number found in any mammal the female platypus has five pairs of different x chromosomes x x while the male has x x and also five different ys y y during meiosis in the male the five xs always end up together in one gamete and the five ys always end up

meiosis b the eggs go all the way through meiosis and then duplicate their chromosomes to become diploid c the eggs go through meiosis i and the chromatids separate to create diploidy d the egg goes

lines of canaries one with yellow feathers and the other with brown feathers in crosses between these two strains yellow female brown male gives only brown sons and daughters while brown female yellow

drosophila to red eyed males he found very rare white eyed females and red eyed males among the offspring he was able to show that these exceptions resulted from nondisjunction such that the white eyed females had received two xs from the egg and a y from the sperm while the red eyed males had received no sex chromosome from the egg and an x from the sperm what progeny would have arisen from these same kinds of nondisjunctional events if they had occurred in the male parent what would their eye colors have been in a vial of drosophila a research student noticed several female flies but no male flies with bag wings each consisting of a large liquid filled blister instead of the usual smooth wing blade when bag winged females were crossed with wild type males of the progeny were bag winged females were normalwinged females and were normal winged males explain these results in calvin bridges began studying an x linked recessive mutation causing eosin colored eyes in drosophila

with red eyes males with red eyes males with eosin eyes and males with cream eyes assume that these numbers represent an ratio a formulate a hypothesis to explain the f and f results assigning phenotypes to all possible genotypes b what do you predict in the f and f generations if the parental cross is between truebreeding eosin eyed males and true breeding cream eyed females c what do you predict in the f and f generations if the parental cross is between true breeding eosin eyed females and true breeding creameyed males in drosophila a cross was made between a yellowbodied male with

of yellow bodied males with vestigial wings yellow bodied males with normal wings males with brown bodies and vestigial wings wild type males brown bodied females with vestigial wings and wild type

enhancing defence decision support under grant rm abstract team sports can be viewed as dynamical systems unfolding in time and thus require tools and approaches congruent to the analysis of dynamical systems the analysis of the pattern forming dynamics of player interactions can uncover the clues to underlying tactical behaviour this study aims to propose quantitative measures of a teams performance derived only using player interactions concretely we segment the data into events ending with a goal attempt that is shot using the acquired sequences of events we develop a coarse grain activity model representing a player to player interaction network we derive measures based on information theory and total interaction activity to demonstrate an association with an attempt to score in addition we developed a novel machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of a team making an attempt to score during a segment of the match our developed prediction models showed an overall accuracy of in predicting the correct segmental outcome from matches in our dataset the overall predicted winner of a match correlated with the true match outcome in of the matches that ended in a result furthermore the algorithm was evaluated on the largest available open collection of soccer logs the algorithm showed an accuracy of in the classification of the segments from matches and correctly predicted the match outcome in of matches that ended in a result the proposed measures of performance offer an insight into the underlying performance characteristics index terms dynamical systems network science distribution entropy football kolmogorov complexity machine learning performance analysis shannon entropy support vector machines soccer i introduction improving comprehension of strategic performance and success in team competition is an important goal in sports science data driven methods can effectively overcome the subjective limitations manual analysis of the match and offer better results for football clubs quantitative analysis can provide players and coaches with such insight by allowing them to improve their match and assessment of the event beyond what personal observation can accomplish traditionally methods of performance analysis push the study of one dimensional and discrete performance indicators towards probabilistic and correlational approaches however this results in somewhat limited functional information as it lacks the associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was paul d yoo the understanding of the player to player interactions that support the actions of players and overall team behaviour it is reasonable to expect an analysis of such one versusone dynamics in team sports to be insufficient as multiplayer interactions are important in determining success and failure therefore in order to quantify and explain performance it has been advocated that performance analysis in team sports must also focus on the interactions between players that sustain the overall team behaviour from the dynamical systems view the understanding of how the coordination emerges from the interaction among the system components that is the player to player interaction is the key to performance analysis in team sports performance analysis approaches that consider the interactions of the players in many multiplayer team competitions like football are not well explored this work is licensed under a creative commons attribution license for more information see https creativecommons org licenses by volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer inspired by empirical studies of networked systems researchers have recently developed a variety of techniques and models to help us understand player interaction network in sports interaction or passing networks can be constructed from the observation of ball transfer between players a key challenge is to leverage the interaction networks to gain a functional understanding of the underlying team strategies for example by examining the structure of interaction networks recurrent pass sequences can be identified and linked to a teams playing style when the emphasis is put at the player level duch et al used the interaction networks to quantify and rank players contribution relative to the overall team activity due to dissimilarity and diversity in real world sports data there is no systematic program for predicting network structure in addition there are no particular subsets of diagnostics that are universally accepted since team networks are intrinsically subjective and dynamic objects it is often hard to determine a suitable way of network characterisation that governs team formation in team sports like football quantifying player to player interaction is the key for understanding the dynamic patterns that generate a scoring opportunity this motivated us to develop an approach that quantitatively characterises players interaction in team sports in this study a data driven approach to the study of complex player interactions from event stream data generated during football matches henceforth referred to as soccer is employed the proposed framework can be used to quantify player interactions and connect that with the outcome using a machine learning approach data driven approaches for soccer analytics are given importance with the availability of the event stream data e g opta wyscout stats secondspectrum scisports and statsbomb cintia et al in their work extracted pass based performance measures to learn the correlation to match outcome using a machine learning approach more recently pappalardo et al in their work employed a machine learning approach to rank players their approach is based on computing statistical features from the event stream data for each player which are then utilised to learn feature weights in a supervised learning framework i e relative to the match outcome the authors then use the learned weights to compute the rating of a player in another recent study by decroos et al the authors have performed a segmental analysis of different match states to extract several associative features of player performance which are then used to determine the scoring or conceding probability using an ensemble classifier in contrast to the above mentioned studies that consider individual players actions or cumulative team statistics the proposed study describes a segment of a match using a set of activity and entropy based quantifiable markers that capture both inter and intra player interactions to quantify interaction among players in team sports conceived as dynamical systems unfolding in time it is important to use appropriate measures the proposed study considers the behaviour of multiple players and the emergent nature of performance to develop pattern forming dynamics that is the dynamic physical relationships that a player may establish with the teammates and opponents to make a goal we developed a coarse grain activity model of player toplayer interaction from the possession chain data that can be used to quantify the dynamic patterns underlying the interaction among players we used the concepts of information theory retrieval to quantify the complexity of a pattern representing player interactions during sub segments of the match another key challenge from the analytics perspective is the format of the soccer log data as different vendors use different data formats therefore an analyst has to develop complex pre processors specific to a dataset to tackle the challenges posed by the variety of event stream formats and to benefit the data science community we propose an approach that uses only a limited amount of information the proposed approach only uses the possession information such as player team action type and result from the event stream data the segmental analysis was thus performed using only the possession information to quantify the team performance and stability in team dynamics during a specific module that is a match segment furthermore based on the derived performance measures we developed a machine learningenabled decision support system for automated prediction of a teams likelihood of a successful attempt at goal ii approach a dataset in this study we have analysed the dataset from a season of major league soccer division of the united states and canada the dataset consists of the possession chain data from matches the interaction information possession chain comprises of time and duration of all ball passes and tackles between players the dataset also includes the nature of the interaction which can be categorised as being between teammates or between opposing players table the positional information includes the x y position of all individuals throughout the entire match minutes b coarse grain player interaction model given a set of possession chain information for each match representing a set of events pass shot etc between players and the game outcome a match is split into a number of segments where each segment represents a phase of the match that begins with either the start of the match or after an attempt shot at the goal and ends with a shot see fig further throughout the text the teams in an adversarial relationship during a match were denoted by team and team for each match in the dataset using the possession information corresponding to every segment in the match we propose a coarsegrain model to find quantifiable measures of performance that demonstrate an associationship with the outcome of that segment that is which team team or team makes an attempt to score by taking a shot at the oppositions goal volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer table an example of ball possession chain data the table shows a part of a ball possession chain dataset which represents events in the st half of a match figure segmentation of the possession chain data a match is split into different segments of varying length or the number of events in a segment ending with a shot the red and blue shaded cells represent possession by different teams each segment was individually evaluated for measures of performance coarse grain models derived from possession chain data each of the match segments was studied separately the segments represent a sequence of ball possession change events leading to an attempt to score each team in a soccer match has players with allowed replacements based on the sequence of events in each segment we define two types of coarse grain models the first model weighs all the events e g pass shot at goal ball lost equally whereas the second model weighs events based on their type more specifically a higher weight of an event denotes a higher relevance as we are interested in measures that quantify a successful attempt to score we assign higher weights to shots and recoveries and lower weights to events like ball lost and faults for each segment we first generate a pairwise player matrix mi j where i j each element of which was initialised to zero the matrix m contains players of both teams i j and i j for team and team respectively and any element mi j represents the interaction of the i th player with j th player in the segment the value of the mi j element denotes the number of times the players interacted or the number of times the players interacted weighed by the type of event for example if player of team passes the ball to player of team the element m of the matrix is incremented by i e m m similarly if player of team recovers the ball in a tackle from player of team then the element m of the matrix is incremented by i e m m therefore the diagonal blocks of the matrix m denote interactions of the players within a team whereas the offdiagonal blocks represent the inter team player interactions thus the matrix m such that mi j i j was termed as the interaction matrix the matrix m represents the connections on the network of players agents related to activitybased decision making to the directed transfer of information ball from one agent to another this coarse grain interaction model m represents the network of connections accumulated over a sequence of events during a segment of the match we analysed the interaction between players based on the following approach a unit increment each element mi j of the interaction matrix is incremented by for an interaction between the i th and j th player of the same team ball passed or players of the different team ball recovery tackle ball lost etc as follows mi j mi j b weighted increment each element mi j of the interaction matrix is weighted by the type of the event et more specifically we assign a weight to each event for evaluation of its contribution given that we are mostly interested in goal attempts we introduce a higher weight for shots in comparison to passes ball losses and other events that lead to loss of ball possession mi j mi j wet volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer where wet is the weight corresponding to the event et as we are interested in the likelihood of a successful attempt at goal we assign a high weight wshot to shots a low weight wpass to passes and an average weight wshot pass to all other event types as suggested by decroos et al c quantification of team performance from coarse grain models to quantify the performance of a team in each segment of the match four measures were proposed total activity index tai to quantify the interaction in a segment the matrix m is further divided into four blocks by summing all the elements mi j in top left team i j in and the bottom right team i j in which represent the overall activity of each team that is obtained by summing the activity of all players in a team the off diagonal elements represent the interaction between players of both teams any row in the top left team i in or bottom right team i in block of matrix m represents the interaction of the i th player with the rest of his team similarly any row in the off diagonal blocks of the matrix m represents player i i of team losing the ball to player j j of team and vice versa we introduce the average team activity matrix t as follows t t t t t where each element of matrix t represents the average activity of each block in m as follows t x n i j mi j t x n i j n mi j t x n i x n j n mi j t x n i n x n j mi j where n and pn i j mi j represent a players activity team i and team i respectively the overall activity ac of each team in a segment is then calculated as ac t t t ac t t t where p i j ti j is a normalisation constant the total activity index tai of the match is then computed as follows tai ac ac information entropy as a measure of performance it has been advocated that performance analysis in a team sports should consider the dynamical nature of the match and must consider player to player interaction the stability and consistency of interaction between different players of a team have been considered as a measure of performance in soccer matches entropy quantifies the uncertainty coming from the random aspect of the dynamics entropy as a measure can be utilised to quantify the consistency of patterns representing player to player interaction in the match a shannon entropy previously shannon entropy has been used as a measure of uncertainty in team sports to quantify the variability associated with the movements of players in a match in this work we have used shannon entropy to quantify the patterns representing player to player interaction during a segment of the match shannon entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or unpredictability in the estimate of the information content of a random variable the shannon entropy h is defined as follows h x n i pi ln pi where pi is the probability of the i th element in the sequence b kolmogorov complexity as an alternative to the probabilistic notion of information content the kolmogorov complexity is based on the concept of recursive function kolmogorov complexity allows the characterisation of chaotic motion in dynamical systems and the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns the kolmogorov complexity c n of a sequence with n samples is the length of the shortest binary program that can generate that sequence as output an appropriate measure of kolmogorov complexity can be defined by h n as follows h n c n b n where b n n log n in this work kolmogorov complexity of the signal was calculated following kaspar et al c distribution entropy distribution entropy disten computes the complexity of a time varying sequence using the distribution of the inter vector distances unlike approximate and sample entropy disten offers high robustness for short length sequences and reduced dependence on pre determined parameters disten has been previously used in many biomedical applications to quantify the complexity of short length signals in the context of soccer disten can be used to characterise the complexity of the dynamical network patterns representing the player to player interaction volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer during a segment the disten of a vector can be defined as disten m log x i pi log pi where is the number of bins in the probability distribution obtained from the data with the lag and embedding dimension m these parameter values are selected based on common recommendations from literature d entropy derived performance indexes to quantify the complex behaviour in which players interact during a soccer match three entropy measures were calculated based on the type of the entropy three indexes were defined shannon entropy index sei kolmogorov complexity index kci and distribution entropy index dei let s n denote the entropy for a sequence of length n we calculate s n for each row in each of the four blocks of the interaction matrix m we introduce a matrix s to represent the team entropy complexity matrix as follows s s s s s here the elements of matrix s represent the averaged entropy complexity of player to player interaction in each block of matrix m as follows s n x n i h mi j n s n x n i n h mi j n n s n x n i h mi j n n s n x n i n h mi j n where n the overall complexity for each team in a segment is given by s s s s s s s s the three entropy derived indexes sei kci and dei of a segment in the match are then computed as follows derivedindex s s where the derivedindex is sei kci dei for s denoting shannon entropy kolmogorov complexity and distribution entropy respectively d machine learning approach the possession chain data from each segment in a match was quantified using the proposed measures which were then used as features for predicting the team that makes the shot during the segment in the model training phase the predictive model was trained using a supervised framework where each segment ending in a shot was given a label if team makes the shot and a label if the opposition makes the shot during the testing and validation phase the learned model was then used to predict the team making the shot in a segmental manner the outcome of the game i e team winning the match was determined based on the classification of the segments team team where the shot ends in a goal for each game we report the segmental performance and the predicted match outcome i e winner of the match we now describe the classifier and the learning procedure support vector machine support vector machines svm are state of art binary state classifiers which are suited for pattern recognition and classification problems with good robustness to overfitting given an i i d learning set x y x y xi yi where x n y the kernel function maps the input feature space to a high dimensional space where the data is linearly separable offering the ability to learn non linear functions and decision boundaries the decision function separating the two classes is learned as a hyperplane the optimisation problem can be formulated as min b k k c n xn i l subject to yi x b i i n where c is a positive regularisation constant and is the slack term by using the lagrange multiplier techniques the optimisation problem in svm is reduced to a dual optimisation problem max k w xn i i xn i xn j iyi jyjkhxi xji subject to pn i iyi and i c i n the learned decision function can then be represented as f x sgn xn i iyikhxi xi b where khxi xji represents the kernel function in this study we have used the gaussian radial basis kernel function learning classification models the classification models were trained using a leave oneout cross validation approach let n represents the total number of matches in leave one out cross validation approach the dataset corresponding to a match is left out while the dataset from the remaining matches n is volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer figure a player interaction matrix m computed for the unit

self interaction main diagonal of the matrix m has been saturated in the left panel to reveal the interaction between the players every element mi j represents the ball originator and receiver for an event the main diagonal blocks in a and b represent the interaction between players of the same team whereas the top right and bottom left corner blocks represent interactions with the players of the opposition team the lighter the color the higher the value of activity between the players for the shown segment team made an offensive attack against the team which is also evident in the higher activity lighter color of team as shown in c and d used for training the svm classifier a feature selection using lasso technique was applied on the training set for finding the least correlated and most discriminating features thus ensuring the test data left out match was not a part of feature selection and model learning procedure iii results and discussion in this study we have analysed each match by segmenting into sequences that end with a shot the possession chain data in each segment was first mapped onto a matrix m representing match integrated ball possession activity of players fig to calculate the estimate of complexity and non linear dynamics in a match of soccer using the proposed coarse grain model of teams activity we introduced four quantitative measures of team performance tai sei kci and dei in addition a machine learning approach was presented where we developed machine learning models to predict the outcome of a segment based on the proposed quantitative measures of performance we first explain the quantitative measures of performance derived from the proposed coarse grain model of player interactions network a total activity index tai b shannon entropy index sei c kolmogorov complexity index kci and d distribution entropy index dei followed figure match g atlanta united fc team vs san jose earthquakes team season final results temporal evolution of the proposed quantitative markers of performance a total activity index tai b shannon entropy index sei c kolmogorov complexity index kci and d distribution entropy index dei derived using the weighted network of connections represented by matrix m the vertical dashed lines indicate the moments at which a goal was scored in the match the red and blue lines represent the goal scored by team and team respectively each interval on the timeline represents the time stamp of the segment ending with a shot by e the performance of the proposed machine learning approach and future work a total activity index tai the total activity index tai is a measure of a teams activity relative to the other during a segment based on the definition of tai a positive value of tai indicates that team is likely to take the shot at the end of the segment while a negative value indicates team table fig a the underlying hypothesis was that the more frequently or longer the players of a team interact during a segment the more likely it is that this team scores in the particular segment of the match this was further corroborated by the minimum and the maximum values of tai as seen for example in match g atlanta united fc team vs san jose earthquakes team season final result that correspond to the segments when first team was trying to score and then team was trying to equalise by maintaining a higher possession of the ball the segment ending at th and th minutes of the match g fig a when plotted with respect to the ground truth i e the outcome of the segment w r t to the team taking the shot the distribution of tai is close to normal for both the teams fig a fig b the descriptive statistics relating to the performance of tai are shown in table results showed significantly different p means for both teams table although a certain overlap could be seen among the tai value ranges derived using the unit and weighted increment matrices table fig a and fig b the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve auc values of and for tai derived from the unit and weighted increment matrices show a good class separability volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer figure a distribution of the proposed measures of performance on shots with respect to the true segmental outcome shown for all matches in the dataset a b tai c d sei e f kci and g h dei derived using unit and weighted network of connections represented by the interaction matrix m the distribution of the derived quantitative measures tai sei kci and dei was close to normal with both teams having a significantly different means p the better performance of the weighted increment matrix shows the introduced bias towards the segment outcome shot due to the higher weights given for the events that are likely to result in goal attempts in comparison to normal passes furthermore the use of weights provides an alternative evaluation function that offers the opportunity to consider the types of events appearing in a pattern and the patterns support to determine its relevance finally the tai derived from the coarse grain activity model shows good potential as a quantitative measure of performance in a team sport like soccer b shannon entropy index sei shannon entropy gives a measure of uncertainty to quantify the randomness associated with a time varying signal the shannon entropy index sei quantifies the underlying variability in player to player interaction for a team relative to the other team the shannon entropy of a team in a segment would be low if only few players interact with each other thus minimising the randomness and the associated unpredictability whereas it would be high if different players are continuously interacting with each other a higher entropy indicates that there is more uncertainty in patternforming dynamics governing the interaction among players alternatively a higher entropy represents that players are not constrained to a specific role and assume a higher tactical role e g players moving both forward backward and through the sides of pitch thus forging more player to player interactions in team sports a longer possession of the ball is likely to forge more player to player interactions especially during a strategy leading to an offensive on the opposition more players are likely to be involved e g in a match of soccer midfielders centre forwards wing forwards can be a part of an attack therefore we hypothesised that the shannon entropy for the team that is attacking would be higher relative to the other therefore as defined in section ii c d sei would be if team is attacking and if team is attacking table fig b the minimum and the maximum values of sei denote an offensive behaviour by team and team respectively segments ending at th and th minute in fig b thus sei can be a good marker indicating when a team makes an offensive against the opposition the sei index correlated with the segment outcomes that is whether team or team takes the shot highest auc table the mean sei for team and team were significantly different for both unit and weighted increment matrix table a similar observation was made from the distribution when sei was plotted with respect to the true outcome of the segment fig c and fig d based on the descriptive statistics table the sei index can be used as a potential marker of a teams performance derived from a coarse grain network model representing player to player interaction c kolmogorov complexity index kci the use of kolmogorov complexity was motivated by the presumption that interaction among players during a segment can be both random or synchronised if certain players interact more frequently let us consider two vectors sx and sy of length each only a maximum of players of each team were active during any segment of the match however a pattern length of was considered as a soccer match can have a maximum of substitutes that represents interaction pattern of players sx and sy the value of the i th element in vectors sx and sy represents the number of times the i th player i interacted with player sx or sy including any self interaction both the sequences sx and sy have the same shannon entropy of and disten of m whereas both have a different kolmogorov complexity and volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer table mean standard deviation and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve statistics of the indexes tai sei kci and dei derived using two different types of interaction matrix m over all matches in the dataset the statistics show that the proposed indexes have significantly different values corresponding to the team taking the shot at the goal a positive value of the derived indexes denotes that team takes the shot while a negative value indicates team relative to whom the indexes are computed respectively sequence sx has a pattern composed of units in recursion whereas sequence sy has no obvious pattern thus sy has a higher complexity in the context of soccer if the players are interacting in a synchronised manner that is few particular players are part of a strategy offensive or defense such patterns would be represented by simpler sequences with lower complexity or unpredictability from a coaches point of view it is important to assess the dynamics of pattern formation occurring in each segment of the match to decode the underlying strategy the proposed kolmogorov complexity index derived from the player toplayer interaction network matrix m gives a quantitative measure of local numerical relations in which the dynamics of a teams pattern formation varies relative to the other team for example if certain players are only restricted to particular parts of the playing pitch as in the formation the playerto player interactions in such a segment would be represented by a less complex patterns like sx on the other hand if a team allocates more players in sub segments of a match to prevent oppositions attacking move i e a defensive strategy or to create an offensive move at oppositions goal the playerto player interactions would be represented by more complex patterns without any recursive sub patterns as shown by sy therefore kolmogorov complexity derived kci index captures the complexity of patterns that is different from shannon entropy derived index or sei kci showed a good correlation when plotted with the segmental outcome of a match auc table a kci value favoured team while a kci indicates a shot taken by team fig c for match g the segment ending at the th minute represents a case when team is making an offensive against the opposition to level the scores at which is shown by the maximum value of kci at the th minute fig c the kci index followed a distribution close to normal when plotted on the true segment outcome that is with respect to the team taking the shot fig e and f with a significantly different mean values for both the teams table kci is a measure to quantify the regularity of complex patterns in which players interact during team sports it gives a numerical relation in which the dynamics of a teams pattern formation varies over the segments of a match kci can allow coaches to discover identify and quantify segments during a match when a team interacts in more complex or rather synchronised patterns d distribution entropy index dei the distribution entropy disten measures the complexity of patterns governing player to player interactions by taking into account the hidden information in the state space via estimating the probability density of inter vector distances a chaotic sequence has the maximum disten thus patterns of player to player interaction with high variability would be characterised by a high disten and vice versa the distribution entropy derived index dei quantifies the chaotic patterns underlying player to player network of interaction for a team relative to the other similar to shannon entropy derived index a dei would indicate a higher variability associated with an attacking move in patterns governing player to player interaction for team when computed relative to team fig d however a particular advantage of dei over sei is that sei can be affected by the variance of the sequences representing player interaction patterns while dei is derived using a probability density function with fixed bin number thus dei is more robust as it considers inter vector distances let us consider two vectors sx and sy that represent the interaction patterns of player x and player y during a segment of the match and having the same number of total interactions psx psy the in sy represents the number of times the th player of the team interacted with player y during the segment the shannon entropy for sx and sy is and respectively whereas disten is and respectively pattern sy represents that player y interacts more frequently times with the th player which results in high inter vector distances thus leading to a higher disten value the interaction pattern represented by sy indicates the events when player y is continuously interacting with a particular player th player in the team this pattern might signify an underlying strategy where the players defender midfielder volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of

sei kci and dei our machine learning approach showed a mean sensitivity of confidence interval ci a specificity of ci and an overall accuracy of in predicting the segmental outcomes of the matches although our dataset comprised of only matches it should be noted that we performed a segmental analysis on segments of different duration segments ending with shot resulting in a sizeable number of samples temporal segments for training and validating the machine learning classifier in addition our approach is based on a robust cross validation approach that ensures no bias of the learned model

competition and the accuracy depicting the percentage of matches where the predicted winner correlated with the true match outcome goal for both the teams fig a in the particular match shown in fig team shown in red won the match the segments where a goal was scored are marked with segments and shown in fig it can be seen in fig that segments where team has scored a goal segments and have a higher likelihood similarly the likelihood for team is higher in the segments where they scored a goal segments and show where both the teams are engaged in gaining the possession of the ball as they want to equalise the segments where the predicted outcome fig b did not match the true outcome fig c are the ones where the possession of the ball is continuously changing between the teams to quantify the minority of segments where the model does not provide a sufficient agreement with the ground truth data in future we would incorporate more sophisticated measures by introducing player

to the overall auc for each of the competitions which shows the consistent performance of the proposed approach across the competitions the italian first division had the highest number of segments ending in shot from the matches the proposed machine learning approach resulted in an auc of ci in correctly classifying the segments furthermore the predicted match winner correlated with the ground

markers tai sei kci and dei of a teams performance furthermore to elaborate the efficacy of the proposed quantifiable markers of team performance we compared the results of the proposed approach with studies that employ a machine learning approach for evaluating performance a direct comparison of the proposed segmental analysis approach can be done with the study by decross et al they employed a segmental analysis to learn the importance of players actions based on the outcome of a match state e g success in taking a shot at opponents goal on the contrary pappalardo et al defined a feature vector for each team and modelled the outcome of the match win loss using a linear support vector machines classifier as both the studies use different datasets therefore to ensure a direct comparison of the proposed approach the algorithms by decross et al and pappalardo et al are run on the soccer logs from matches of competitions the model estimation and the learning task was performed using a leave one out crossvalidation approach as explained in section ii d additionally the results on the public dataset were compared with the study by cintia et al who analysed the match outcome using pass based performance indicator h indicator and evaluated the performance on the german spanish italian and english division leagues for a comparison of the segmental performance the algorithm by decross et al was used to model the segments ending in a shot with an xgboost classifier the algorithm by decross et al showed an overall auc of table in comparison the proposed approach showed a similar performance with an overall auc of on analysed segments table further for a comparison of the correctly predicted match outcome the algorithm table comparisons of the proposed approach with some recent machine learning based studies by pappalardo et al was employed the algorithm by pappalardo et al could correctly classify the match outcome in of matches that ended in a result among the competitions table in comparison the proposed approach could correctly classify the match winner in of matches furthermore in comparison to the study by cintia et al who reported a mean accuracy in correctly predicting the match outcome the proposed approach showed a higher mean accuracy of german spanish italian and english division in correctly predicting the match outcome the improved performance of the proposed approach shows the robustness and efficiency of the proposed quantitative markers tai sei kci and dei in capturing a teams underlying performance characteristics table the performance of the proposed approach can be attributed to the use of kernelised classifier and the nonlinearity of the proposed indices like sei kci and dei that can quantify the underlying non linear dynamics of player interaction based on the performance validation on external dataset and comparison with recent studies it can be concluded that the proposed approach offers a data driven framework for evaluating a teams performance in a segmental manner offering the potential for predictive analytics in sport sciences using data science research volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled

lines in subplots a and b represent the mean across all the players of a team the rectangular box in histogram plot for team subplot a indicates the players p p p p p and p who maintain a ball possession activity that is higher than the teams mean player p who makes the shot at goal had the highest interaction with the rest of the players during team ball possession activity in contrast the ball possession activity of team is mainly among players p p p and p g interpretability for sports analysts our analysis shows that the interaction between players is essential for generating a scoring opportunity to outline the applicability of the proposed features we use histogram plots representing each players feature values that are derived from the player interaction matrix m for a segment of the match fig the histograms illustrate the level of interaction of each player when their team has possession of the ball the players that are more frequently involved in the ball possession have feature values above the teams mean value which is represented by the dashed line as shown in fig across this match segment team performs better than team because the segment ends with team having a successful attempt at scoring i e a shot at goal six players of team p p p p p and p maintain a level of interaction as indicated by the rectangular box in a above the teams mean which is higher than team where only three players are above the teams mean as indicated by the rectangular box in fig b the feature activity shows the players that are more frequently involved in a teams ball possession activity the remaining features shnen kolcmp and disten were also above average for more players in team than for team sports analysts can interpret this as an association between the complexity of passing between players and the likelihood of having a shot at goal in other words when a team has possession of the ball there may be a benefit in making a relatively large number of passes between a large proportion of the team as they move the ball towards their opponents goal post the usual analysis of an opponents tactics is a resourceintensive procedure as most tactical analyses are performed by manually reviewing the match videos or scouting matches in person to identify the players that are constantly part of the ball possession activity and are involved in generating scoring opportunities the features used in the present analysis may enable the automatic identification of such players using a data driven approach for example player p in team is one such player who had the highest ball possession activity during the shown segment of the match indicated by an in fig a identifying the players that are more frequently involved in match states that end with an attempt at scoring i e a shot at goal may assist sports analysts and team staff to develop strategies suited to an opponents playing style the proposed study presents different characteristics of a teams performance during a segment of a match that ends with a shot on the goal although there are different ways to define match segments e g a segment ending with the ball going out a foul etc the purpose of the study was to identify the characteristics leading to an attempt at scoring a goal therefore in this study we analysed segments ending with a shot on the goal which is also a limitation of the study furthermore the influence of match location quality of opposition match type etc were not controlled for while developing the predictive models thus further research is required to investigate the effects of these variables to further enhance the understanding of teams and players performances iv conclusion our study proposes information theory derived quantifiable measures of performance that can uncover the dynamic patterns underlying team sports like soccer the study provides first evidence of a machine learning enabled approach for volume s kusmakar et al machine learning enabled team performance analysis in the dynamical environment of soccer automated predictive analysis of performance in a segmental manner offering the potential for uncovering local numerical markers of team performance our developed predictive models show a mean accuracy of in predicting the segmental outcome of the likelihood of team making a successful attempt to score a goal on our dataset comprising matches in addition the segmental outcomes could predict the correct overall winner in of the matches that resulted in a winner furthermore the validation on an external dataset comprising segments from matches showed the robustness of the approach finally the study demonstrates that the analysis we present can help uncover the pattern dynamics of a teams network derived using possession chain data by quantitatively analysing measures of performance that have a specific distribution and that can be used to predict the performance of a team acknowledgment the

m rocha osorio and alfeu j sguarezi filho senior member ieee abstract this paper presents a new long range generalized predictive controller in the synchronous reference frame for a wind energy system doubly fed induction generator based this controller uses the state space equations that consider the rotor current and voltage as state and control variables to execute the predictive control action therefore the model of the plant must be transformed into two discrete transference functions by means of an auto regressive moving average model in order to attain a discrete and decoupled controller which makes it possible to treat it as two independent single input single output systems instead of a magnetic coupled multiple input multiple output system for achieving that a direct power control strategy is used based on the past and future rotor currents and voltages estimation the algorithm evaluates the rotor current predictors for a defined prediction horizon and computes the new rotor voltages that must be injected to controlling the stator active and reactive powers to evaluate the controller performance some simulations were made using matlab simulink experimental tests were carried out with a small scale prototype assuming normal operating conditions with constant and variable wind speed profiles finally some conclusions respect to the dynamic performance of this new controller are summarized index terms direct power control doubly fed induction generator flux oriented control generalized predictive control long range predictive control wind energy systems i introduction renewable energy production is worldwide accepted by academics and industries like an interesting alternative to traditional generation mainly due to the growing scarcity of fossil fuels and the dreadful effect of the greenhouse gases on the climate of earth a phenomenon known as global warming of all possible arrangements for wind energy systems the most commonly used is the double fed induction generator dfig based configuration mainly due to its control stability since it is possible to access to the stator and rotor windings to the partial power electronic converter sizing as the back to back converter only processes the of the rated power but keep in mind that the total cost of the system is much higher due primarily to the constant maintenance of the slip rings and the continuous replacement of the rotor brushes on the other hand the generalized predictive control gpc is a part of the model based predictive controllers mbpc family this theory was formulated by clarke et al in the late s its basic algorithm its properties and interpretations its possible applications and extensions were explained for himself and his co workers in the following years in the next decade for zhang et al presented an interesting gpc application in the synchronous reference frame for regulating the stator current of an induction machine im with experimental results but without a good dynamic response in steady state kennel et al in developed a practical optimized gpc with flux oriented control foc for an im using a speed control strategy the prototype can supply the demand for processing power considering the realtime conditions in a digital processor application and the consequent great calculation effort of the gpc algorithms in an interesting paper revisited the operating principle of mbpcs and identifies its constitutive elements the prediction model the cost function and the optimization algorithm summarizing the most recent research and providing details about the different proposed solutions then in mahmoud and oyedeji presents a special survey for adaptive and predictive control strategies for wind turbines which include the nonlinear mbpcs but without delving into the gpc strategy which is also part of that broader theory of the predictive controllers the gpc mbpc proposed here uses a new dfigs dynamic model based on a discrete transfer function and a controlled auto regressive integrated moving average carima model equation to make a stator power control by means of a long range rotor current prediction which will have an implicit integral term although this is a wellknown stochastic model its application to the dfig remained unpublished until now therefore the gpc control law must minimize a quadratic cost function that uses the past states of the rotor currents the n step ahead rotor current predictors and the rotor current references to estimate the next rotor voltages and thus controlling the stator powers at real time

september some gpc formulations across the time has been focused on different control problems for wind energy systems such as the pitch angle control the mppt control the system stability etc also the use of different types of generators like the permanent magnet pmsg the squirrel cage induction generator sqig and even the switching reluctance generator srg were considered for all the above mentioned the main motivation of this research is to demonstrate that a long range gpc formulation with direct power control dpc strategy that uses a control horizon equal to the prediction horizon can govern the dfigs stator powers when generator is working under normal operating conditions and constant and variable wind speed profiles are assumed from all of these gpc formulations mentioned below the work of vieira dias et al proposes a gpc robust strategy that forcing to the control signal to follows its reference very quickly and without overshoot that rejecting disturbances and using for tuning the set point only a single parameter as is done in this paper the parameter that must be tuned via a heuristic method is called the controller weighting factor an mppt with a gpc for a pmsg based stand alone wind system was proposed by mohamed amine bouzid et al with a better performance than the classic pi controller however the proposed controller was evaluated only by simulation results thus for the long range gpc proposed here a set of experimental results are present to ensure its correct performance a predictive hysteresis current control for a srg drive was presented by r et al in this algorithm predicts the plant behavior considering the finite set of the power converter states and choosing the most suitable voltage vector so as to reduce the current amplitude error and to minimize a cost function a multiple vector predictive power control direct model for the grid side converter control of a wind energy system pmsg based using a full field programmable gate array was presented in in another predictive controller proposed by kou et al describes an optimized control action that can be directly applied to the power converter yielding a better controller performance and achieving a short computation time using a finite control set of variables with longer prediction horizons in addition new nonlinear controllers can deal mimo systems in the non triangular form as is the case of the dfig state space model using a fuzzy logic controller and a state filter or combining the back stepping recursive design with lyapunov function theory and thus resolve this stochastic finite time control problem therefore this new strategies could be used to improve the time response and the performance of the dfig based wind energy systems vrdq the long range gpc proposed here performs its control action estimating the rotor current predictors and then applying the proper voltage vectors in the dfig rotor terminals after the minimization of the quadratic cost function composed of the rotor currents and its references as well as the increment in the rotor voltage this long range gpc dq also requires constant switching frequency and constant sampling time these control parameters are shown in appendix b moreover some classical controllers as pi or nonlinear controllers like fuzzy adaptive and robust controllers etc precise of a big set of rules or a tricky matrix calculation in counter position this longrange gpc dq only requires one weighting factor to be adjusted via a heuristic procedure however what it can be an advantage can also be a disadvantage since the iterative trial and error procedure cannot ensure optimal value for this factor therefore the approach proposed by rodriguez et al which consists of an analytical method using the fake algebraic ricatti equation for the optimal tuning of this weight factor could be used to improve the dynamic response of this gpc dq for demonstrate all above mentioned about this long range gpc dq authors decides the following paper structure the dfig model based on carima model and the equations for calculating the generator discrete transfer functions are described in section ii next in section iii the gpc dq algorithm is explained in all detail including the rotor current predictors calculation the estimation of the past states of the system the cost function minimization and its corresponding predictive control law to evaluate the next component of the rotor voltage then simulation tests are depicted in section iv for fixed and variable rotor speed also including a comparison with a pi controller and a parameter variation test experimental test are presented in section v to corroborate the performance of this gpc strategy finally some conclusions about the dynamic performance of the new gpcdq are written in section vi ii the dfig model in the stator flux oriented reference frame v sq vs dq vsd sq s dq s sd the long range gpc for dfig uses the synchronous reference frame also named the dq frame therefore the dynamic model for the controller must be in the same reference as the plant i e the long range gpc dq must be fixed respect to the stator flux space vector just as the dfig model is this last is also known as the stator flux oriented control sfoc strategy therefore the dynamic model of the plant meets the following orientation conditions and x t d ird t dt x t d irq t dt x t ird t x t irq t u t vrd t u t vrq t according to a state space feedback model for dfig can be written in dq frame considering the stator and rotor currents and voltages due to the gpc algorithm explained below is focused on the rotor side converter rsc as is depicted in fig the rotor currents and rotor voltages are chosen as state and control variables respectively these can be written using the standard nomenclature for state variables for control variables therefore the space state equations for dfig as shown as follows x t rr lr x t slx t lr u t x t slx t rr lr x t lr u t sllm lslr s rr lr l m lslr lm sl where are the rotor resistance and rotor inductance is the total coupling factor is the mutual inductance and is the dfig slip angular speed in ap ieee caa journal of automatica sinica vol no september pendix b the dfig parameters are summarized r s however since an expression for the rotor voltage for this state feedback model is required in this paper authors decide to maintain the commonly used notation with and subscripts for the rotor and stator variables and also due to the need to use for obtaining the dfig model other variables of the machine such as stator and rotor fluxes therefore the above mentioned expression for rotor voltage can be derived according with as follows vr dq rr ir dq d r dq dt j sl r dq the use of the stator flux orientation method for the closed control loops allows the independent control of the active and reactive power of the stator by regulating the rotor currents since the dfig is connected to the mains by means of a backto back converter the control goal is to command the stator powers by applying the right voltage to the rotor terminals replacing the quadrature rotor flux component from in its possible to write an expression for the rotor voltages in terms of rotor currents in this way vrdq rr irdq d dt lm isdq lr irdq j sl lm isdq lr irdq isolating in the expression for direct stator flux component the stator current vector considering that the stator flux is constant and its derivative equal to zero due to the plant is oriented by the sfoc it is possible to rewrite the expression into two separate state equations therefore for d axis dird t dt rr lr ird t slirq t lr vrd t and for q axis di rq t dt slird t rr lr i rq t lr v rq t sllm lslr s t these equations are equivalent to and and it is possible rewrite it in two independent transfer functions by means of the laplace transform one for the d axis and another one for the q axis in this case the transfer functions become orthogonal due to the sfoc this is an additional advantage for the proposed gpc controller because a multiple input multiple output system mimo can be treated by two independent and totally decoupled single input singleoutput siso systems iii the gpc dq control algorithm n the long range gpc dq derived for dfig power control is described in following sections a gpc algorithm gives an integral action of the closed loop system and the present state is estimated using the model and some old known input and output data this nonlinear controller works with a constant sample time step equal to ms and its prediction horizon is for a better comprehension of the longrange gpc dq a fully explanation is done starting with the dfig carima model and the estimation of its associated polynomials in section iii a then the rotor current predictors estimation and the past states of the system are addressed in section iii b finally the cost function minimization and the predictive control law estimation are explained in sections iii c and iii d respectively a obtaining the dfig carima model coefficients for digital control applications a continuous transfer function must be discretized using for instance the ztransform therefore since that the plant is oriented by sfoc and can be discretized a simplified transfer function for d axis given by is g s rr s lr lr s rlrr ird s vrd s sl lr graphically the previous transfer function is presented in fig and its possible to see the cross coupling terms applying the z transform to this continuous transfer function two discrete transfer functions using the standards z transform tables can be obtained only a transfer function for the d axis is shown h z tlr e rr lrt z a z b z a z a z b z by means of the carima model from and the discrete transfer function a set of coefficients for and polynomials can be derived normally the prediction is calculated using instead of and since to

the n step ahead current predictor calculation t vrd vrq n t when the dfig carima model is already done and supposing that at an arbitrary instant of time the rotor voltage components and will be well

grid connected dfig wind energy system working under normal operating conditions and confirm that the gpc dq is totally applicable to these kinds of renewable energy systems the proposed algorithm had been explained in all detail although for simulation and experimental purposes the prediction horizon is restricted to a value no greater than but a flowchart for the general case is presented in the appendix a an additional advantage of this gpc strategy relative to other controllers such as pi lies in the fact that a single weight parameter needs to be adjusted however its value could not be the optimal one in simulation scenarios the dfig parameter variations were also tested again the gpc remains a null steady state error and a little and short overshoot the settling time for the power responses is similar to presented in the fixed and variable speed tests for the fixed step response test both the settling time and the steady state error are fast enough with a few of milliseconds of time near to ms and a percentage less than also when gpc dq is compared with a pi controller a faster settling time is observed in variable rotor speed conditions the gpc dq performance is adjusted to the requirements due to the fact that the rotor currents and therefore the stator powers remain constants and following the references imposed in addition the generator can provide active and reactive power to the grid when it passes from sub synchronous to super synchronous speed the pwm commutation noise present in experimental results is contemptible when dfig is linked to the power network and

in uncertainty conditions abstract the article describes the analysis of conditions of secondary condensation complex functioning there the software algorithm for estimating the forecasts of functioning mode is developed which makes it possible to prepare the complex operator in conditions of existing uncertainty for making decisions in supervisor control mode keywords secondary condensation ammonia production forecast evaluation uncertainty conditions one of the most crucial stages of separation of ammonia synthesis of am series units operating in ukraine is secondary condensation which performs the final removal of commercial ammonia from the synthesis cycle previous studies have improved the energy efficiency of the secondary condensation stage by creating an optimal structure that ensures the exclusion of electrically driven turbocompressor refrigeration unit from the operational scheme and reducing the thermal load on low temperature evaporators lte technological complex of this structure is formed by additional heat exchanger ah condensing column c high temperature evaporator hte with steam jet refrigerating unit sjru and two ltes with waterammonia refrigerating units wacu functioning of the secondary condensation complex is done under conditions of uncertainty which is mainly due to constant changes in the external heat load due to the application of aircooled circulating gas g units at the previous stage of primary condensation and the lack of possection technical sciences sibility of continuous automatic control of ammonia concentration in cg at the same time the range of changes at the inlet of the complex temperature of the cg and ammonia concentration in the cg is c and respectively under such circumstances the cg temperature at the hte inlet which is included in the sjru operational scheme will also change therefore it is necessary to apply a control system to stabilize the cg temperature at the inlet at c and therefore stabilize the cg temperature at the hte inlet at c which was provided by the functional scheme of secondary condensation process control however the process equipment of the complex of secondary condensation is characterized by significant inertia which is due to its large metal intensity only the mass of cc is about tons at the same time sjru is a rather complicated technological system in which change of refrigerating capacity and consequently expenses of the coolant to hte are in general performed at the expense of changing the number of working ejectors therefore for the purpose of increasing control reliability and possibility of preparation of the operator for such changes in the supervisor control mode which is provided by the functional control scheme a subsystem of decision making support is necessary it should provide assessment of forecasts of possible changes in cg temperature at the inlet of hte setting of this temperature will condition the determination of forecast of necessary sjru refrigerating capacity and consequently of coolant costs to hte and monoethanolamine mea solution to sjru steam generator which provides necessary supply of working steam

process of heat exchange ah to determine the temperature of cg at the outlet of its inter pipe space then according to this temperature the necessary cooling capacity of sjrus is sequentially determined which will condition the stabilization of ah temperature at the outlet of htes at the level of c coolant consumption in htes for its provision consumption of working ammonia vapor for

and information systems ul o nierska pl szczecin poland phone fax email andrzej piegat ii tuniv szczecin pl marcin plucinski ii tuniv szczecin pl abstract the imc structure often used in fuzzy and neural control requires both a model of the plant and its inversion the paper presents how a more parsimonioues structure using only the model inversion invmc can be designed and how the inversion can be found the invmc structure was applied for control of the underwater vehicle uv krab ii introduction for control of nonlinear systems the imc structure described eg in and shown on fig a is often used a b a wp anti windup figure the imc a and the invmc b structure its advantage is internal stability of the whole system when both the plant and the imc controller separately are stable it refers also to nonlinear plants and controllers as fuzzy and neural ones the imc structure enables to approach the so called perfect control the same can also be shown for the invmc structure which is simpler the common advantage of both structures is a small number of parameters to be tuned in the imc it is usually only the filter time constant and in the invmc the pre controller gain in the pid control gains must be tuned what considerably complicates the synthesis in the literature not many application examples of the pure invmc structure can be found usually the model inversion is combined with the model or with other controller types as eg with a predictive or pd controller below an algorithm shortly because of the paper limitation for the invmc system will be presented it is described precisely in the book fuzzy modeling and control by piegat being prepared for printing in polish design algorithm of invmc systems designing of invmc systems consists of two main steps i design of the inversion f inv of the controlled plant f ii structure choosing and tuning of the pre controller lets assume the plant realizes the nonlinear input output mapping the ideal inversion f inv would be the one realizing dynamic requirements determined by the reference model fig because in real dynamic systems it is impossible as real reference models can be assumed eg inertia ones as given by figure inversion design in the system with reference model for c one gets fast inversion for c slow one the fast inversion has usually strong differential action and generates great control signals m often greater than saturations of the setting unit with c we can decrease and slow down the control signal and increase the system robustness however the same we can get with an appropriately slow pre controller therefore below will be used fast inversion c described by if the inversion is accurately tuned fig then k what implicates replacing in according to the variables k i by e k n m i i n m and then inverting it we get inversion condition of its high accuracy is a good chosen structure rule base membership functions etc and good tuning what can be made eg in the system with reference model fig where the plant f is replaced by its model f error backpropagation also other possibilities for the tuning given in can be used when the inversion is accurate we can replace on fig b the connection f inv f by the inversion reference model p fig figure system with reference model enabling design of the pre controller gc this way the pre controller design can be made basing on linear control systems methods for many plants of the type n m good control quality is achieved with integral pre controller given in discrete version by q r r ts to increase the control quality application

introduction in power plants boiler drum is a closed vessel in which steam is produced by burning coal in the furnace the main input variable of the boiler drum are fuel feed water and air the outputs of the boiler system are electrical power steam pressure steam temperature and flue gas as shown in fig according to these parameters the drum level may increase or decrease the boiler drum level should be monitored continuously it should be within a certain limited value if the measurement of boiler drum level is not within the limited value water carryover may be occurred if the level is low in drum overheating occur in boiler water tube this cause the damages in boiler drum surface and creates the cracks in the surface if the value of level in boiler drums more than the limited value it may transfer the moisture into the turbine which reduce the boiler efficiency fig basic block diagram of drum level control p meenu is described the boiler drum level control which is done by fuzzy logic controller if the water level is too low in boiler drum it leads to boiler explosion if the water level is very in boiler drum it cause damage to turbine due to the affect of separator steam water serious consequences occur in high or low level so we must take strict control conventional proportional integral derivative controller is popular three element control if there is any process disturbance the element control does perform well due to the lack of proportional controller gain knowledge the collected data from the pid controller is used to gain the knowledge on the intelligent

sensing kerala india pp march machine learning for credit card fraud detection lu s fernando torres lu s fernando torres follow min read mar introduction from food delivery apps to online clothing stores the internet made it easier to purchase whatever we want whenever we want with the convenience of using our credit cards to do so credit cards are useful for a bunch of things it saves us from the inconvenience of having to carry large amounts of cash with us to each place we go and it also allows us to advance a purchase that can be paid over time according to statista the number of worldwide transactions rose from billion to billion per year from to considering that we have billions of transactions happening daily all over the world and that people are using their credit cards more than ever through cellphone apps online stores and using digital wallets it isnt hard to imagine that there are fraudsters looking for ways to make purchases using somebody elses name and money in a scenario such as this one it is extremely important that credit card companies are able to identify fraudulent transactions in order to avoid charging customers for items they didnt purchase and thats why i developed a machine learning classification model to teach a computer how to identify patterns that can tell when a transaction is in fact genuine or a fraud for this project i used pythons scikit learn library and tested four different classification algorithms to identify which one of them would achieve the best results with our dataset machine learning briefly machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and it focuses on the use of data and algorithms to teach a computer to imitate the human way of learning improving its accuracy gradually through experience and performance of tasks machine learning is an important component of data science and it uses statical methods and trains algorithms to perform tasks such as predictions and classifications based on some input data that allows the algorithm to produce an estimate about a pattern in the data if you wish to know more about machine learning and its use click here to read an ibm article on the matter scikit learn scikit learn is an open source machine learning library for python that offers simple and efficient tools for classification regression clustering dimensionality reduction data preprocessing comparisons validations and parameters choosing for different algorithms classification algorithms for this project i used four different classification algorithms to perform the task of identifying patterns that make up fraudulent transactions i used the decision tree classifier which is a simple algorithm used to predict the value of a certain target variable through the learning of simple decision rules inferred from the data features i also used the random forest classifier ada boost classifier and gradient boosting classifier algorithms based on ensemble methods which combines predictions of several base estimators to improve robustness over a single estimator the random forest classifier for instance is based on the construction of hundreds of random decision trees in order to get into a final result ill leave a link below for the scikit learn online documentation where youll be able to read and acquire in depth explanations on classifiers how they work and the math behind them credit card fraud detection project development this project was developed in python language in jupyter notebook and published on github and kaggle the first step of course is importing all the necessary libraries for development libraries for exploring handling and visualizing dat import pandas as pd numpy as np matplotlib pyplot as plt seaborn as sns plotly express as px sklearns preprocessing library from sklearn preprocessing import standardscaler importing train and test data split from sklearn model selection import train test split sklearns metrics to evaluate our models from sklearn metrics import accuracy score precision score confusion matrix recall score f score classifiers from sklearn ensemble import randomforestclassifier from sklearn ensemble import adaboostclassifier from sklearn ensemble import gradientboostingclassifier from sklearn tree import decisiontreeclassifier setting theme style and color palette to seaborn sns set theme context notebook style darkgrid palette muted a understanding the dataset i then used pandas read csv method to obtain our data and used df head to see the dataframe the dataset used for this project was the credit card fraud detection dataset available on kaggle and it contains credit card transactions that were made during the month of september by european clients during two days it has transactions and variables the variable time contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset amount contains the value of each transaction and lastly we have class which is a binary feature that tells us if that certain transaction was genuine or a fraud we also have other features v v v that are numerical inputs result of a pca transformation whose content couldnt be displayed due to their confidential nature during exploration analysis it was possible to see that the dataset contains only numerical inputs and no null values were present i proceeded to an analysis on the amount feature with the describe method statistics on the amounts df amount describe round it is possible to see that of transactions were below and the highest transaction amount was much higher than the average amount of lets plot amounts on a scatter plot to see how these values are distributed in the dataset distribution of amount fig px scatter df x amount y df index color df class title distribution of amount values fig update layout xaxis title transaction amount in yaxis title transactions fig show png it looks like most transactions are genuine represented by the blue dots we can also see that all high value transactions were in fact genuine with no apparent fraudulent transaction being made above it seems however way too difficult to see any fraudulent transaction on the scatter plot those were supposed to be represented by yellow dots and all i can see are some small yellow colors behind all that blue on the left this leaves us with a question how many transactions were in fact fraud i used plotly to plot a pie chart to see how our classes are distributed in the dataset and this below is the result ive gotten visualizing class distribution fig px pie df class values df class value counts names genuine fraud title fraudulent x genuine transactions in the dataset fig show png df class value counts well no wonder it wasnt easy to see fraudulent transactions on the scatter plot only of transactions were fraudulent thats out of transactions we have a huge class imbalance to work on here lets try to get some more information on fraudulent transactions df query class amount describe the highest fraud amount was on average fraudulent amounts costed around lets plot these values on a scatter plot once again distribution of fraudulent transactions amount fig px scatter df query class x amount y df query class index title distribution of fraudulent amounts fig update layout xaxis title transaction amount in yaxis title transactions fig show png preparing data the time variable wont be any useful for this project so i dropped it from the dataframe df df drop columns time axis after doing that i divided the dataset into the independent variables x and the target variable y x df drop columns class axis y df class visualizing target variable class y visualizing independent variables x after doing that it is time to split our data into training set and testing set ive split them into for training and for testing train x test x train y test y train test split x y test size random state print x train size train x shape print x test size test x shape print x test proportion s round len test x len train x len test x print y train size train y shape print y test size test y shape print y test proportion s round len test y len train y len test y we now have transactions for training and transactions for testing after that i used standardscaler to normalize amount values since these values were way too discrepant when compared to the other features in the dataset it is important to have all variables in a similar scale because otherwise the algorithm will attribute a heavier importance to the variable that has the biggest scale which will end up in a biased algorithm and negatively impact our results we dont want that standardscaler is actually pretty simple and it standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then dividing values by the standard deviation in order to avoid the data leakage effect it is important to apply standardscaler on each training and testing set separately scaling data on the training set scaler standardscaler train x amount scaler fit transform train x amount values reshape train x scaling data on the testing set scaler standardscaler test x amount scaler fit transform test x amount values reshape test x after that we proceed to deal with the imbalance of our data i used imblearn library to apply smote in order to oversample the fraudulent data which means that i increased the total number of fraudulent transactions by synthetically generating more of them based on the frauds that we already have in the dataset just to remember this is how fraudulent and genuine transactions are distributed in the dataset y value counts genuine transactions fraud i then applied smote on the training set from imblearn over sampling import smote train x train y smote fit resample train x train y reshaping data and counted values on the train y set train y value counts now we have a balance between genuine and fraudulent transactions in the training set note that ive only applied oversampling in the training set while maintaining the test set untouched with its original proportions and i did that because the test set must be a full representation of reality applying classifiers well after all that work done lets see how well the algorithms can predict the fraudulent transactions on the training set applying random forest classifier random

fit train x train y y prediction gb gradient boosting predict test x before evaluating how well our models performed ill briefly talk about the evaluation metrics for classification algorithms evaluation metrics for classification models when dealing with classification models there are some evaluation metrics that we can use in order to see the efficiency of our models one of those evaluation metrics is the confusion matrix which is a summary of predicted results compared to the actual values of our dataset this is what a confusion matrix looks like for a binary classification problem tp is for true positive and it shows the correct predictions of a model for a positive class fp is for false positive and it shows the incorrect predictions of a model for a positive class fn is for false negative and it shows the incorrect predictions of a model for a negative class tn is for true negative and it shows the correct predictions of a model for a negative class beyond the confusion matrix we also have some other relevant metrics they are accuracy accuracy simply tells us the proportion of correct predictions this is how we calculate it precision precision tells us how frequently our model correctly predicts positives this is how we calculate it recall recall which can also be referred to as sensitivity can tell us how well our model predicts the class that we want to predict this is how we calculate it f score lastly f score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall this is how we calculate it random forest scores lets the metrics for random forest and its confusion matrix printing evaluation metrics for random forest metrics accuracy accuracy score test y y predictions rf precision precision score test y y predictions rf recall recall score test y y

confusion matrix random forest ax xaxis set ticklabels genuine fraud ax yaxis set ticklabels genuine fraud plt show decision tree scores ada boost scores gradient boosting scores lets see how many fraudulent and genuine transactions we have in the testing set to compare these values with what we have on the confusion matrixes above counting how many fraudulent and how many genuine transactions we have on the testing set test y value counts the model that predicted the most numbers of fraudulent transactions correctly was the ada boost classifier who correctly identified frauds out of with a recall the highest of all the other algorithms remember recall tells us how well our model predicts the class we want to predict conclusion when we work with a machine learning model we must always know for a fact what it is that were trying to get from that model in this project our goal is to detect fraudulent transactions when they occur and the model that best performed such task was the ada boost classifier with a recall of correctly detecting fraudulent transactions out of however it is also important to note that the ada boost classifier had the biggest number of false positives that is genuine transactions were mistakenly labeled as fraud thats of all genuine transactions a genuine purchase being incorrectly identified as a fraud could be a problem in this scenario it is necessary to understand the business and make a few questions such as how cheap would a false positive be would we keep the ada boost classifier with the best performance in detecting frauds while also detecting a lot of false positives or should we use the random forest classifier who also performed pretty well identifying frauds recall and reduced the number of false positives of genuine transactions flagged as fraud but that would also imply in a larger number of fraudsters getting away with it and customers being mistakenly charged these questions and a deeper understanding of how the business works and how we want to approach solving a problem using machine learning are fundamental for a decision making process to choose whether or not if were willing to deal with a larger number of false positives to detect the largest amounts of frauds as possible github and kaggle if you wish to see the full project and how i developed it step by step you can see it on github and

what are ensemble methods in machine learning aqeel anwar towards data science aqeel anwar follow published in towards data science min read jan a visual walkthrough of the ensemble methods in machine learning with a cheatsheet background lets say you moved to a new place and want to dine out how do you find a good place solution find a food critic who is really good at his her work and see if he she has any recommendations for the restaurants in your area solution use google and randomly look at one users review for a couple of restaurants solution use google and look at multiple users reviews for a couple of restaurants and average their ratings let us analyze each of the above mentioned solutions solution food critics are in general much accurate it is difficult to find a food critic maybe the food critic you found was a strict vegetarian and you are not in that case the recommendations from the food critic will be biased solution on the other hand picking up a random persons star rating for a restaurant on the internet is much less accurate easier to find solution collectively it can be just the right amount of accuracy you need easier to find over the internet much less biased since the users who have rated the restaurants come from various backgrounds hence without the need to ask from a food critic you can get a reasonably good recommendation on restaurants just by looking at a collective opinion of a group of random but large people this is known as the wisdom of the crowd and is the backbone to various informative websites like quora stack exchange and wikipedia etc what are ensemble methods ensemble methods in machine learning use more than one weak learner collectively to predict the output instead of training one large complex model for your dataset you train multiple small simpler models weak learners and aggregate their output in various ways to form your prediction as shown in the figure below inference ensemble method image by author types of ensemble methods generally speaking there are three different types of ensemble methods commonly used in ml these days bagging boosting stacking these methods have the same wisdom of the crowd concept but differ in the details of what it focuses on the type of weak learners used and the type of aggregation used to form the final output bagging in bagging bootstrap aggerating multiple weak learners are trained in parallel for each weak learner the input data is randomly sampled from the original dataset with replacement and is trained a random sampling of the subset with replacement creates nearly iid samples during inference the test input is fed to all the weak learners and the output is collected the final prediction is carried out by voting on the outputs of each weak learner the complete steps are shown in the block diagram below ensemble method bagging image by author in bagging methods the weak learners usually are of the same type since the random sampling with replacement creates iid samples and aggregating iid variables doesnt change the bias but reduces variance the bagging method doesnt change the bias in the prediction but reduces its variance boosting in boosting multiple weak learners are learned sequentially each subsequent model is trained by giving more importance to the data points that were misclassified by the previous weak learner in this way the weak learners can focus on specific data points and can collectively reduce the bias of the prediction the complete steps are shown in the block diagram below ensemble method boosting image by author the first weak learner is trained by giving equal weights to all the data points in the dataset once the first weak learner is trained the prediction error for each point is evaluated based on the error for each data point the corresponding weight of the data point for the next learner is updated if the data point was correctly classified by the trained weak learner its weight is reduced otherwise its weight is increased apart from updating the weights each weak learner also maintains a scalar alpha that quantifies how good was the weak learner in classifying the entire training dataset the subsequent models are trained on these weighted sets of points one way of carrying out training on a weighted set of points is to represent the weight term in the error instead of using mean squared error a weighted mean squared error is used ensuring that data points with higher assigned weight are given more importance in being correctly classified the other way could be weighted sampling i e sample points based on their weights when training in the inference phase the test input is fed to all the weak learners and their output is recorded the final prediction is achieved by scaling each weak learners output with the corresponding weak learners weight alpha before using them for voting as shown in the diagram above stacking in stacking multiple weak learners are trained in parallel which is similar to what happens in bagging but unlike bagging stacking does not carry out simple voting to aggregate the output of each weak learner to calculate the final prediction rather another meta learner is trained on the outputs of weak learners to learn a mapping from the weak learners output to the final prediction the complete block diagram can be seen below ensemble method stacking image by author stacking usually has weak learners of different types hence a simple voting method that gives equal weights to all the weak learners prediction doesnt seem like a good idea it would have been if the weak learners were identical in structure that is where the meta learner comes in it tries to learn which weak learner is more important the weak learners are trained in parallel but the meta learner is trained sequentially once the weak learners are trained their weights are kept static to train the meta learner usually the meta learner is trained on a different subset than what was used to train the weak learners cheat sheet the following cheat sheet covers the topic of ensemble methods that might come in handy cheat sheet ensemble methods source

shailey dash follow published in towards data science min read nov though decision trees look simple and intuitive there is nothing very simple about how the algorithm goes about the process deciding on splits and how tree pruning occurs in this post i take you through a simple example to understand the inner workings of decision trees iris decision tree from scikit learn image source sklearn decision trees are a popular and surprisingly effective technique particularly for classification problems but the seemingly intuitive interface hides complexities the criterion for selecting variables and hierarchy can be tricky to get not to mention gini index entropy wait isnt that physics and information gain isnt that information theory as you can see there are lots of tricky problems on which you can get stuck on the best way to understand decision trees is to work through a small example which has sufficient complexity to be able to demonstrate some of the common points one suddenly goes not sure what happens here this post is therefore more like a tutorial or a demo where i will work through a toy dataset that i have created to understand the following what is a decision tree root node sub nodes terminal leaf nodes splitting criteria entropy information gain vs gini index how do sub nodes split why do trees overfit and how to stop this how to predict using a decision tree so lets get demonstrating what does a decision tree do lets begin at the real beginning with core problem for example we are trying to classify whether a patient is diabetic or not based on various predictor variables such as fasting blood sugar bmi bp etc this is obviously a prediction problem for a new patient we also have patient records to help us develop an understanding of which features are most useful in predicting unlike other classification algorithms such as logistic regression decision trees have a somewhat different way of functioning and identifying which variables are important the first thing to understand in decision trees is that they split the predictor space i e the target variable into different sub groups which are relatively more homogenous from the perspective of the target variable for example if the target variable is binary with categories and shown by green and red dots in the image below then the decision tree works to split the target variable space into sub groups that are more homogenous in terms of having either s or s target variable splitting process image source author that is the overall concept let us begin with understanding the various elements of a decision tree understanding components of a decision tree a decision tree is a branching flow diagram or tree chart it comprises of the following components a target variable such as diabetic or not and its initial distribution a root node this is the node that begins the splitting process by finding the variable that best splits the target variable node purity decision nodes are typically impure or a mixture of both classes of the target variable or green and red dots in the image pure nodes are those that have one class hence the term pure they either have green or red dots only in the image decision nodes these are subsequent or intermediate nodes where the target variable is again split further by other variables leaf nodes or terminal nodes are pure nodes hence are used for making a prediction of a numerical or class is made lets see this visually structure of a decision tree image source my collection in general a decision tree takes a statement or hypothesis or condition and then makes a decision on whether the condition holds or does not the conditions are shown along the branches and the outcome of the condition as applied to the target variable is shown on the node arrows leading away from a node indicate a condition which is being applied to the node arrows pointing to a node indicate a condition that is being satisfied this is the first level of the decision tree understanding the flow of splitting the decision space into smaller spaces which ultimately become more and more homogenous in the target variable this ultimately leads to a prediction decision trees offer tremendous flexibility in that we can use both numeric and categorical variables for splitting the target data categoric data is split along the different classes in the variable numeric is a little more tricky as we have to split into thresholds for the condition being tested such as and for example a numeric variable can appear multiple times in the data with different cut offs or thresholds also final classifications can be repeated the important things from data science perspective are flow of information through the decision tree how does decision trees select which variable to split on at decision nodes how does it decide that the tree has enough branches and that it should stop splitting now let us look at a simplified toy example to understand the above process more concretely first the problem we have data for data points of student data on pass or fail an online ml exam to understand the basic process we begin with a dataset which comprises a target variable that is binary pass fail and various binary or categorical predictor variables such as whether enrolled in other online courses whether student is from a maths computer science or other background whether working or not working the dataset is given below toy dataset for online ml exam source author notice that only one variable student background has more than levels or categories maths cs others it is one for the advantages of decision trees compared to other classification models such as logistic regression or svm that we do not need to carry out one hot encoding to make these into dummy variables let us first look at the flow of how a decision tree works and then we will dive into the complexities of how the decisions are actually made flow of a decision tree a decision tree begins with the target variable this is usually called the parent node the decision tree then makes a sequence of splits based in hierarchical order of impact on this target variable from the analysis perspective the first node is the root node which is the first variable that splits the target variable to identify the root node we would evaluate the impact of all the variables that we have currently on the target variable to identify the variable that splits the exam pass fail classes into the most homogenous groups our candidates for splitting this are background working status and other online courses what do we hope to achieve with this split suppose we begin with working status as the root node this splits into sub nodes one each for working and not working thus the pass fail status is updated in each sub node respectively sample decision tree flow image source author created so this is the basic flow of the decision tree as long as there is a a mixture of pass and fail in a sub node there is scope to split further to try and get it to be only one category this is termed the purity of the node for example not working has pass and fail hence it is purer than the working node which has p and f a leaf node would be one which contains either pass or fail class only a node which is impure can be branched further for improving purity however most of the time we do not necessarily go down to the point where each leaf is pure it is also important to understand that each node is standalone and hence the attribute that best splits the working node may not be the one that best splits the not working node now let us move on to learning the core part of decision trees key questions how does the tree decide which variable to branch out at each level greedy top down approach decision trees follow a a top down greedy approach that is known as recursive binary splitting the recursive binary splitting approach is top down because it begins at the top of the tree and then it successively splits the predictor space at each split the predictor space gets divided into and is shown via two new branches pointing downwards the algorithm is termed is greedy because at each step of the process the best split is made for that step it does not project forwards and try and pick a split that might be more optimal for the overall tree the algorithm therefore evaluates all variables on some statistical criteria and then chooses the variable that performs best on the criteria variable selection criterion here is where the true complexity and sophistication of decision lies variables are selected on a complex statistical criterion which is applied at each decision node now variable selection criterion in decision trees can be done via two approaches entropy and information gain gini index both criteria are broadly similar and seek to determine which variable would split the data to lead to the underlying child nodes being most homogenous or pure both are used in different decision tree algorithms to add to the confusion it is not clear which one is the preferred approach so one has to have an understanding of both let us begin with entropy and information gain criterion what is entropy entropy is a term that comes from physics and means a measure of disorder more specifically we can define it as entropy is a scientific concept as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder randomness or uncertainty the term and the concept are used in diverse fields from classical thermodynamics where it was first recognized to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics and to the principles of information theory https en wikipedia org wiki entropy in information theory the entropy of a random variable is the average level of information surprise or uncertainty inherent to the variables possible outcomes https en wikipedia org wiki entropy information theory in the context of decision trees entropy is a measure of disorder or impurity in a node thus a node with more variable composition such as pass and fail would be considered to have higher entropy than a node which has only pass or only fail the maximum level of entropy or disorder is given by and minimum entropy is given by a value leaf nodes which have all instances belonging to class would have an entropy of whereas the entropy for a node where the classes are divided equally would be entropy is measured by the formula where the pi is the probability of randomly selecting an example in class i let us understand this a bit better in the context of our example so the initial entropy of at the parent node is given by the probability of getting a pass vs fail in our dataset the target variable has passes and fails hence the probabilities for the entropy formula are now essentially what a decision tree does to determine the root node is to calculate the entropy for each variable and its potential splits for this we have to calculate a potential split from each variable calculate the average entropy across both or all the nodes and then the change in entropy vis a vis the parent node this change in entropy is termed information gain and represents how much information a feature provides for the target variable entropy parent is the entropy of the parent node and entropy children represents the average entropy of the child nodes that follow this variable in the current case since we have variables for which this calculation must be done from the perspective of the split work status online course status student background to calculate entropy first let us put our formulas for entropy and information gain in terms of variables in our dataset probability of pass and fail at each node i e the pi entropy average entropy at child nodes note average entropy is the weighted average of all the sub nodes that a parent node splits into thus in our example this would be sub nodes for working status and sub nodes for student background information gain parent node calculations first we will calculate parent node entropy using the formula above use any log calculator online to calculate the log values in our case they work out to mathematical note log to base of anything less than is a negative number hence we multiply by a minus sign to get a positive number so far this is just the entropy of the parent node now we have to decide which attribute or variable to use to split this to get the root node calculating the root node for this we have to calculate a potential split from each variable calculate the average entropy across both the nodes and then the change in entropy via a vis the parent node let us begin with work status variable and calculate the entropy of the split we then calculate the average entropy for the working status split as a weighted average with weights of the share of observations from the total number of observations that fall in each sub node information gain entropy parent entropy child calculations are shown in the spreadsheet below in a similar fashion we can evaluate the entropy and information gain for student background and online courses variables the results are provided in the table below we will drop this variable for the time being and move on to evaluate the other variables the spreadsheet below shows the entropy calculations for all the variables root node entropy calculations source author to find the root node attribute we look at the information gain from student background vis a vis initial parent entropy this shows the maximum reduction of hence this is the attribute that would be selected as the root node the others variables working status and online courses show a much lower decrease in entropy vis a vis the parental node so on the basis of the above calculations we have determined what the root node would be the tree would now look as follows root node of decision tree student background splits the target variable into groups everyone from cs background clearly passes and hence this is a terminal or leaf node everyone from other backgrounds fails and this is also a terminal node maths background is split into pass and fail and hence it is impure and there is some scope for further splitting to attain greater purity now to split the maths background sub node we need to calculate entropy and information gain for the remaining variables i e working status and online courses we would then select the variable that shows the highest information gain the entropy and information gain calculations for the maths background node can be seen in the table below notice we now have the maths background as the node that is being split hence average entropy for the splits is calculated using it as a base note putting in log throws an error however mathematically we can use the limit normally we just dont include the pj case in the calculation however i have included just to show the complete calculation by convention log since y log y as y https www icg isy liu se courses infotheory lect pdf the entropy for each potential split is splitting the maths subnode image source author as we can see information gain is higher for the working status variable hence this is the variable used to continue branching maths node branching we now see that the maths node has split into terminal node on the right and one node which is still impure notice now almost all our nodes are terminal nodes there is only one node which is not terminal we can try splitting it further using other online courses anyway you get the picture in any case most decision trees do not necessarily split to the point where every node is a terminal node most algorithms have built in stops which we will discuss a little further down further if the decision tree continues to split we have another problem which is that of overfitting again we shall discuss that below after we have briefly reviewed an alternative approach to developing a decision tree using the gini index gini index the other way of splitting a decision tree is via the gini index the entropy and information gain method focuses on purity and impurity in a node the gini index or impurity measures the probability for a random instance being misclassified when chosen randomly the lower the gini index the better the lower the likelihood of misclassification the formula for gini index where j represents the no of classes in the target variable pass and fail in our example p i represents the ratio of pass total no of observations in node so lets take an example from the decision tree above lets begin with the root node and calculate the gini index for each of the splits the gini index has a minimum highest level of purity of it has a maximum value of if gini index is it indicates a random assignment of classes now let us calculate the gini index for the root node for student background attribute in this case we have nodes gini formula requires us to calculate the gini index for each sub node then do a weighted average to calculate the overall gini index for the node maths sub node pass fail cs sub node pass fail others sub node pass fail as we can see the probability for misclassification in cs node is zero since everyone passes similarly no scope for misclassification on others node as everyone fails only the maths node has possibility of misclassification and this is quite high given that the maximum gini index is the overall gini index for this split is calculated similarly to the entropy as weighted average of the distribution across the nodes similarly we can also compute the gini index for working status and online courses these are given below working not working online courses the gini index is lowest for the student background variable hence similar to the entropy and information gain criteria we pick this variable for the root node in a similar fashion we would again proceed to move down the tree carrying out splits where node purity is less gini index vs information gain depending on which impurity measurement is used tree classification results can vary this can make small or sometimes large impact on your model there seems to be no one preferred approach by different decision tree algorithms for example cart uses gini id and c use entropy the gini index has a maximum impurity is and maximum purity is whereas entropy has a maximum impurity of and maximum purity is how does a prediction get made in decision trees now that we have understood hopefully in detail how decision trees carry out splitting and variable selection we can move on to how they do prediction actually once a tree is trained and tested prediction is easy the tree basically provides a flow chart based on various predictor variables suppose we have a new instance entering the flow along with its values of different predictor variables unlike training and test data it will not have the class for the target attribute we are trying to predict this class by moving down the tree testing its values of different predictor variables at different branches ultimately the new instance will move into a leaf node and will be classified according to the class prevailing in the leaf node suppose it looks like the below configuration based on our tree we would first check the math branch then working yes branch that as we have seen is a leaf node and the new observation would be classified on the basis of the majority vote in this node i e since it is pass this new observation would also be predicted to be pass in practice when the algorithm is evaluating a new example and reaches a leaf node the prediction is based on the modal value of categories in the leaf node as seen in the above case the working node is not fully pure however we go with the prediction of the modal value which is pass in general most leaf nodes are not pure and hence for categorical prediction we use the modal value for prediction if it is a numerical prediction regression tree we predict the mean value of the target values at each leaf node overfitting and decision trees overfitting can be a big challenge with decision trees even in our toy example we can see the algorithm continues to split till it reaches a leaf node often the leaf node may just have one or two instances this will clearly lead to a complex tree structure which may not generalize well to a test scenario this is because each leaf will represent a very specific set of attribute combinations that are seen in the training data and the tree will not be able to classify attribute combinations not seen in the training data there are several ways we can prevent the decision tree from becoming too unwieldy broad approaches to avoiding overfitting are distinguished pre pruning or early stopping preventing the tree from growing too big or deep post pruning allowing a tree to grow to its full depth and then getting rid of various branches based on various criteria ensembling or using averages of multiple models such as random forest we will only briefly overview at pre and post pruning techniques here ensemble techniques such as random forest require more explanation and hence will be tackled in a separate article pruning pre pruning the pre pruning technique refers to the early stopping of the growth of the decision tree the pre pruning technique involves tuning the hyperparameters of the decision tree model prior to the training pipeline the hyperparameters of the decisiontreeclassifier in sklearn include max depth min samples leaf min samples split which can be tuned to early stop the growth of the tree and prevent the model from overfitting the best way is to use the sklearn implementation of the gridsearchcv technique to find the best set of hyperparameters for a decision tree model a challenge with the early stopping approach is that it faces a horizon problem where an early stopping may prevent some more fruitful splits down the line post pruning in this technique we allow the tree to grow to its maximum depth then we remove parts of the tree to prevent overfitting we effectively consider subtrees of the full tree which are evaluated on a criteria and then removed hence we are effectively going up the tree and converting leaves to nodes and subtrees the criteria whether a particular consolidation goes through or not is usually mse for regression trees and classification error for classification trees a challenge with post pruning is that a decision tree can grow very deep and large and hence evaluating every branch can be computationally expensive an important post pruning technique is cost complexity pruning ccp which provides a more efficient solution in this regard ccp is a complex and advanced technique which is parametrized by the parameter in scikit learn decisiontreesclassifier module so how does ccp work and what does it do the basic problem that ccp addresses is how to determine the best way to prune a tree intuitively we would select a sub tree to prune such that its removal leads to a lower test error rate this can be done using cross validation or if we have sufficient sample the validation set approach however given the number of sub trees in a fully grown tree for even a small sample this is likely to be a very computationally and time intensive process cost complexity pruning also known as weakest link pruning gives us a way to do just this rather than considering every possible subtree we consider a sequence of trees indexed by a nonnegative tuning parameter the tuning parameter controls a trade off between the subtrees complexity and its fit to the training data when then the subtree t will simply equal t because then just measures the training error however as increases there is a price to pay for having a tree with many terminal nodes and so the quantity will tend to be minimized for a smaller subtree an introduction to statistical learning p essentially the parameter is very similar to the penalty term in lasso regression the basic equation for ccp is given below ccp equation hastie p image source james et al this is one complex equation but lets try and understand a bit further some definitions rm rm is the rectangle i e the subset of predictor space corresponding to the mth terminal node y rm is the predicted response associated with mth terminal leaf yi y rm mse for the sub tree referenced by terminal node m we are using regression tree approach for this equation for simplicity i am following the equation and approach in james et al t is the no of terminal nodes in the tree t now lets see what the equation is doing we are essentially minimizing cost or loss given by yi y rm across all terminal nodes now is a term that multiplies the total number terminal nodes in the tree if then we are minimizing the training loss the tree will be the same as the original tree however with we add a penalty term which increases with the number of terminal nodes t this means the overall cost gets minimized for a smaller subtree minimal cost complexity pruning recursively finds the node with the weakest link the weakest link is characterized by an effective alpha where the nodes with the smallest effective alpha are pruned first https scikit learn org stable auto examples tree plot cost complexity pruning html what does this mean it means that the algorithm is hunting out nodes where the training loss is already high and hence can only be minimized with a small on the other hand nodes where the training loss is smaller can accommodate a larger penalty term as part of minimization to get an idea of what values of ccp alpha could be appropriate scikit learn provides decisiontreeclassifier cost complexity pruning path that returns the effective alphas and the corresponding total leaf impurities at each step of the pruning process as increases more of the tree is pruned we then have a tradeoff between bias and variance with the ccp alpha effectively we increase the bias of the model i e we simplify it however on the con side this means we have to tolerate increasing levels of impurity in the terminal nodes we see that as increases both no of nodes and tree depth reduces how to determine optimal plotting ccp alpha vs train and test accuracy we see that when and keeping the other default parameters of decisiontreeclassifier the tree overfits leading to a training accuracy and testing accuracy as alpha increases more of the tree is pruned thus creating a decision tree that generalizes better at some point however further increases in actually lead to a decrease in test accuracy as the model becomes too simplified in this example setting ccp alpha maximizes the testing accuracy refer to https scikit learn org stable auto examples tree plot cost complexity pruning html for details accuracy vs alpha image source sklearn advantages and disadvantages of trees decision trees trees give a visual schema of the relationship of variables used for classification and hence are more explainable the hierarchy of the tree provides insight into variable importance at times they can actually mirror decision making processes white box model which is explainable and we can track back to each result of the model this is in contrast to black box models such as neural networks in general there is less need to prepare and clean data such as normalization and one hot encoding of categorical variables and missing values note the sklearn implementation currently does not support categorical variables so we do need to create dummy variables similarly it does not support missing values but both can be handled in theory model can be validated statistically disadvantages prone to overfitting and hence lower predictive accuracy decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated this problem for example can be mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble can be non robust i e a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree predictions are approximate based on relevant terminal nodes hence it it may not be the best method to extrapolate the results of the model to unseen cases decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate it is required to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree so thats it for decision trees form start to at least two thirds of the way there are a lot of complexities hence i cannot say end i hope you liked this blog on the inner workings of decision trees one thing is clear this is far from a simple technique i have so far reviewed only the complexities of how variables hierarchy is chosen and a tree structure is built up and how pruning is done there are many types of decision tree algorithms even in scikit learn these include id c c and cart exploration of these models is for another blog references g james d witten t hastie and r

published in epfl extension school min read feb k how to quickly get a handle on almost any tabular dataset find the code to this article here getting a good feeling for a new dataset is not always easy and takes time however a good and broad exploratory data analysis eda can help a lot to understand your dataset get a feeling for how things are connected and what needs to be done to properly process your dataset in this article we will touch upon multiple useful eda routines however to keep things short and compact we might not always dig deeper or explain all of the implications but in reality spending enough time on a proper eda to fully understand your dataset is a key part of any good data science project as a rule of thumb you probably will spend of your time in data preparation and exploration and only in actual machine learning modeling investigation of structure quality and content overall the eda approach is very iterative at the end of your investigation you might discover something that will require you to redo everything once more that is normal but to impose at least a little bit of structure i propose the following structure for your investigations structure investigation exploring the general shape of the dataset as well as the data types of your features quality investigation get a feeling for the general quality of the dataset with regards to duplicates missing values and unwanted entries content investigation once the structure and quality of the dataset is understood we can go ahead and perform a more in depth exploration on the features values and look at how different features relate to each other but first we need to find an interesting dataset lets go ahead and load the road safety dataset from openml structure investigation before looking at the content of our feature matrix x lets first look at the general structure of the dataset for example how many columns and rows does the dataset have and how many different data types do those features include structure of non numerical features data types can be numerical and non numerical first lets take a closer look at the non numerical entries even though sex of driver is a numerical feature it somehow was stored as a non numerical one this is sometimes due to some typo in data recording these kind of things need to be taken care of during data preparation once this is taken care of we can use the describe function to investigate how many unique values each non numerical feature has and with which frequency the most prominent value is present using the code df x describe exclude number structure of numerical features next lets take a closer look at the numerical features more precisely lets investigate how many unique values each of these feature has this process will give us some insights about the number of this process will give us some insights about the number of binary unique values ordinal to unique values and continuous more than unique values features in the dataset conclusion of structure investigation at the end of this first investigation we should have a better understanding of the general structure of our dataset number of samples and features what kind of data type each feature has and how many of them are binary ordinal categorical or continuous for an alternative way to get such kind of information you could also use df x info or df x describe quality investigation before focusing on the actual content stored in these features lets first take a look at the general quality of the dataset the goal is to have a global view on the dataset with regards to things like duplicates missing values and unwanted entries or recording errors duplicates duplicates are entries that represent the same sample point multiple times for example if a measurement was registered twice by two different people detecting such duplicates is not always easy as each dataset might have a unique identifier features e g an index number or recording time that is unique to each new sample so you might want to ignore them first and once you are aware about the number of duplicates in your dataset you can simply drop them with drop duplicates missing values another quality issue worth to investigate are missing values having some missing values is normal what we want to identify at this stage are big holes in the dataset i e samples or features with a lot of missing values per sample to look at number of missing values per sample we have multiple options the most straight forward one is to simply visualize the output of df x isna with something like this this figure shows on the y axis each of the individual samples and on the x axis if any of the features contains a missing value while this is already a useful plot an even better approach is to use the missingno library to get a plot like this one from both of these plots we can see that the dataset has a huge hole caused by some samples where more than of the feature values are missing for those samples filling the missing values with some replacement values is probably not a good idea therefore lets go ahead and drop samples that have more than of missing values the threshold is inspired by the information from the data completeness column on the right of this figure per feature as a next step lets now look at the number of missing values per feature for this we can use some pandas trickery to quickly identify the ratio of missing values per feature from this figure we can see that most features dont contain any missing values nonetheless features like nd road class junction control age of vehicle still contain quite a lot of missing values so lets go ahead and remove any feature with more than of missing values small side note missing values there is no strict order in removing missing values for some datasets tackling first the features and than the samples might be better furthermore the threshold at which you decide to drop missing values per feature or sample changes from dataset to dataset and depends on what you intend to do with the dataset later on also until now we only addressed the big holes in the dataset not yet how we would fill the smaller gaps this is content for another post unwanted entries and recording errors another source of quality issues in a dataset can be due to unwanted entries or recording errors its important to distinguish such samples from simple outliers while outliers are data points that are unusual for a given feature distribution unwanted entries or recording errors are samples that shouldnt be there in the first place for example a temperature recording of c in switzerland might be an outlier as in very unusual while a recording at c would be an error similarly a temperature recording from the top of mont blanc might be physical possible but most likely shouldnt be included in a dataset about swiss cities of course detecting such errors and unwanted entries and distinguishing them from outliers is not always straight forward and depends highly on the dataset one approach to this is to take a global view on the dataset and see if you can identify some very unusual patterns numerical features to plot this global view of the dataset at least for the numerical features you can use pandas plot function and combine it with the following parameters lw lw stands for line width means that we dont want to show any lines marker instead of lines we tell the plot to use as markers for each data point subplots true subplots tells pandas to plot each feature in a separate subplot layout this parameter tells pandas how many rows and columns to use for the subplots the means as many as needed while the means to use columns per row figsize markersize to make sure that the figure is big enough we recommend to have a figure height of roughly the number of features and to adjust the markersize accordingly so what does this plot look like each point in this figure is a sample i e a row in our dataset and each subplot represents a different feature the y axis shows the feature value while the x axis is the sample index these kind of plots can give you a lot of ideas for data cleaning and eda usually it makes sense to invest as much time as needed until youre happy with the output of this visualization non numerical features identifying unwanted entries or recording errors on non numerical features is a bit more tricky given that at this point we only want to investigate the general quality of the dataset so what we can do is take a general look at how many unique values each of these non numerical features contain and how often their most frequent category is represented to do so you can use df x describe exclude number datetime there are multiple ways for how you could potentially streamline the quality investigation for each individual non numerical features none of them is perfect and all of them will require some follow up investigation but for the purpose of showcasing one such a solution what we could do is loop through all non numerical features and plot for each of them the number of occurrences per unique value we can see that the most frequent accident i e accident index had more than people involved digging a bit deeper i e looking at the individual features of this accident we could identify that this accident happened on february th at in cardiff uk a quick internet search reveals that this entry corresponds to a luckily non lethal accident including a minibus full of pensioners the decision for what should be done with such rather unique entries is once more left in the the subjective hands of the person analyzing the dataset without any good justification for why and only with the intention to show you the how lets go ahead and remove the most frequent accidents from this dataset conclusion of quality investigation at the end of this second investigation we should have a better understanding of the general quality of our dataset we looked at duplicates missing values and unwanted entries or recording errors it is important to point out that we didnt discuss yet how to address the remaining missing values or outliers in the dataset this is a task for the next investigation but wont be covered in this article content investigation up until now we only looked at the general structure and quality of the dataset lets now go a step further and take a look at the actual content in an ideal setting such an investigation would be done feature by feature but this becomes very cumbersome once you have more than features for this reason and to keep this article as short as needed we will explore three different approaches that can give you a very quick overview of the content stored in each feature and how they relate feature distribution looking at the value distribution of each feature is a great way to better understand the content of your data furthermore it can help to guide your eda and provides a lot of useful information with regards to data cleaning and feature transformation the quickest way to do this for numerical features is using histogram plots luckily pandas comes with a builtin histogram function that allows the plotting of multiple features at once there are a lot of very interesting things visible in this plot for example most frequent entry some features such as towing and articulation or was vehicle left hand drive mostly contain entries of just one category using the mode function we could for example extract the ratio of the most frequent entry for each feature and visualize that information skewed value distributions certain kind of numerical features can also show strongly non gaussian distributions in that case you might want to think about how you can transform these values to make them more normal distributed for example for right skewed data you could use a log transformation feature patterns next step on the list is the investigation of feature specific patterns the goal of this part is two fold can we identify particular patterns within a feature that will help us to decide if some entries need to be dropped or modified can we identify particular relationships between features that will help us to better understand our dataset before we dive into these two questions lets take a closer look at a few randomly selected features in the top row we can see features with continuous values e g seemingly any number from the number line while in the bottom row we have features with discrete values e g but not while there are many ways we could explore our features for particular patterns lets simplify our option by deciding that we treat features with less than unique features as discrete or ordinal features and the other features as continuous features continuous features now that we have a way to select the continuous features lets go ahead and use seaborns pairplot to visualize the relationships between these features important to note seaborns pairplot routine can take a long time to create all subplots therefore we recommend to not use it for more than features at a time given that in our case we only have features we can go ahead with the pairplot otherwise using something like df continuous iloc could help to reduce the number of features to plot there seems to be a strange relationship between a few features in the top left corner location easting osgr and longitude as well as location easting osgr and latitude seem to have a very strong linear relationship knowing that these features contain geographic information a more in depth eda with regards to geolocation could be fruitful however for now we will leave the further investigation of this pairplot to the curious reader and continue with the exploration of the discrete and ordinal features discrete and ordinal features finding patterns in the discrete or ordinal features is a bit more tricky but also here some quick pandas and seaborn trickery can help us to get a general overview of our dataset first lets select the columns we want to investigate as always there are multiple way for how we could investigate all of these features lets try one example using seaborns stripplot together with a handy zip for loop for subplots note to spread the values out in the direction of the y axis we need to chose one particular hopefully informative feature while the right feature can help to identify some interesting patterns usually any continuous feature should do the trick the main interest in this kind of plot is to see how many samples each discrete value contains there are too many things to comment here so lets just focus on a few in particular lets focus on features where the values appear in some particular pattern or where some categories seem to be much less frequent than others and to shake things up a bit lets now use the longitude feature to stretch the values over the y axis these kind of plots are already very informative but they obscure regions where there are a lot of data points at once for example there seems to be a high density of points in some of the plots at the nd latitude so lets take a closer look with an appropriate plot such as violineplot or boxenplot or boxplot for that matter and to go a step further lets also separate each visualization by urban or rural area interesting we can see that some values on features are more frequent in urban than in rural areas and vice versa furthermore as suspected there seems to be a high density peak at latitude this is very likely due to the more densely populated region around london at feature relationships last but not least lets take a look at relationships between features more precisely how they correlate the quickest way to do so is via pandas corr function so lets go ahead and compute the feature to feature correlation matrix for all numerical features note depending on the dataset and the kind of features e g ordinal or continuous features you might want to use the spearman method instead of the pearson method to compute the correlation whereas the pearson correlation evaluates the linear relationship between two continuous variables the spearman correlation evaluates the monotonic relationship based on the ranked values for each feature and to help with the interpretation of this correlation matrix lets use seaborns heatmap to visualize it this looks already very interesting we can see a few very strong correlations between some of the features now if youre interested actually ordering all of these different correlations you could do something like this as you can see the investigation of feature correlations can be very informative but looking at everything at once can sometimes be more confusing than helpful so focusing only on one feature with something like df x corrwith df x speed limit might be a better approach furthermore correlations can be deceptive if a feature still contains a lot of missing values or extreme outliers therefore it is always important to first make sure that your feature matrix is properly prepared before investigating these correlations conclusion of content investigation at the end of this third investigation we should have a better understanding of the content in our dataset we looked at value distribution feature patterns and feature correlations however these are certainly not all possible content investigation and data cleaning steps you could do additional steps would for example be outlier detection and removal feature engineering and transformation and more a proper and detailed eda takes time it is a very iterative process that often makes you go back to the start after you addressed another flaw in the dataset this is normal its the reason why we often say that of any data science project is data preparation and eda take home message be mindful that an in depth eda can consume a lot of time and just because something seems interesting doesnt mean that you need to follow up on it always remind yourself what the dataset will be used for and tailor your investigations to support that goal sometimes it is also ok to just do a quick and dirty data preparation and exploration this will allow you to move on to the data modeling part rather quickly and to establish a few preliminary baseline models and perform some informative results investigation viola jones algorithm and haar cascade classifier complete explanation and mathematics for beginners mrinal tyagi towards data science mrinal tyagi follow published in towards data science min read jul viola jones is a novel approach to rapid detection of objects with running capabilities of frames per second it

using opencv library viola jones detector a viola jones detector consists of following steps calculating integral image calculating haar like features adaboost learning algorithm cascade filter what are haar like features haar features are the relevant features for face detection it was proposed by alfred haar in they are like convolutional kernels there are various types of haar like features but the most dominant features used are rectangular haar features rectangular haar features rectangular haar features image by author inspired https docs opencv org d d tutorial js face detection html the values of a rectangular feature is the difference between the sum of the pixels within rectangular regions the regions have same shape and size and are horizontally and vertically adjacent a three rectangular feature computes the sum in a centre rectangle finally a four rectangular feature computes the difference between diagonal pairs of rectangles various variations of these regions of different sizes are convolved through the image in order to get multiple filters that will be inputs to the adaboost training algorithm calculation of these features using the standard technique would require a high computation time in order to reduce this time a new approach called the integral image was suggested by the authors of the paper what is an integral image because we have to use haar like features in all possible sizes and locations which eventually result in around k features to calculate which is a really big number the problem with novel calculation of haar features is that we have to calculate the average of a given region multiple times and the time complexity of these operations are o n n we can use an integral image approach to achieve o running time a given pixel in the integral image is the sum of all the pixels on the left and all the pixels above it image by author inspired https www mathworks com help images integral image html image by author inspired https m blog naver com natalliea the sum of all purple boxes in the original image is equal to the sum of green boxes in the integral image subtracted by the purple boxes in the integral image calculation

f h i j technique for calculation of sum of regions for calculation of haar like features in a constant amount of time image by author boosting and adaboost algorithm boosting refers to any ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner the general idea of most boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially each trying to correct its predecessor adaboost also known as adaptive boosting is one of the most popular boosting techniques used adaboost one way for a new predictor to correct its predecessor is to pay a bit more attention to the training instances that the predecessor under fitted this results in new predictors focusing more and more on the hard cases this is known as adaptive boosting for example to build an adaptive boosting classifier a first base classifier such a decision tree or svm classifier is trained and used to make predictions on the training set the relative weights of the misclassified predictions are altered and increased in order to lay more emphasis on these predictions while making the next predictor a second classifier is trained using the updated weights and again it makes predictions on the training set weights are updated and so on once all the predictions are trained the ensemble method makes predictions very much like boosting except the predictors have different weights depending on their overall accuracy on the weighted training set the drawback of this type of algorithm is that it cannot be parallelized thereby increasing time required thus after successfully running adaboost on all the features we are left with the most relevant features required for detection therefore this reduces computational time as we dont have to go through all the features and is much more efficient image by author inspired hands on machine learning with scikit learn keras and tensorflow concepts tools and techniques to build intelligent systems deep dive into adaboost algorithm lets take a closer look at the adaboost algorithm each instance weight w i is initially set to m a first predictor is trained and its weighted error rate r is computed on the training set here we take only the misclassified instances and sum up the weights of those instances to get the weighted error rate image by author the predictors weight j is then computed using the formulae given below the more accurate the predictor is the higher its weight will be if it is just guessing randomly then its weight will be close to zero however most often it is wrong and its weight will be negative image by author next the instance weights are updated using the formula provided below in order to boost the misclassified instances image by author then all the predictors are normalized using the formulae provided below image by author finally a new predictor is trained using the updated weights and the whole process is repeated until the desired number of predictors is reached which is specified by the user during inference adaboost simply computed the predictions of all the predictors and weights then using the predictor weight j the predicted class is the one that receives the majority of weighted votes cascade filter strong features are formed into a binary classifier positive matches are sent along to the next feature negative matches are rejected and exit computation reduces the amount of computation time spent on false windows threshold values might be adjusted to tune accuracy lower threshold yield higher detection rated and more false positives image by author inspired https www researchgate net figure cascade classifier illustration fig in simple terms each feature acts as a binary classifier in a cascade filter if an extracted feature from the image is passed through the classifier and it predicts that the image consists of that feature then it is passed on to the next classifier for next feature existence check otherwise it is discarded and next image is checked this thereby decreases computation time as we have to check only some features in windows where the object is not present rather than checking all features this is the main part of the algorithm that allows it to process videos at a rate of approximately frames per second and enables real time implementation implementation using opencv library references rapid object detection using a boosted

learn keras and tensorflow concepts tools and techniques to build intelligent systems by aurelien geron stay tuned for new research papers explanation like this feel free to connect and give ur suggestions prev tutorial cascade classifier introduction working with a boosted cascade of weak classifiers includes two major stages the training and the detection stage the detection stage using either haar or lbp based models is described in the object detection tutorial this documentation gives an overview of the functionality needed to train your own boosted cascade of weak classifiers the current guide will walk through all the different stages collecting training data preparation of the training data and executing the actual model training to support this tutorial several official opencv applications will be used opencv createsamples opencv annotation opencv traincascade and opencv visualisation note createsamples and traincascade are disabled since opencv consider using these apps for training from branch for cascade classifier model format is the same between and x important notes if you come across any tutorial mentioning the old opencv haartraining tool which is deprecated and still using the opencv x interface then please ignore that tutorial and stick to the opencv traincascade tool this tool is a newer version written in c in accordance to the opencv x and opencv x api the opencv traincascade supports both haar like wavelet features and lbp local binary patterns features lbp features yield integer precision in contrast to haar features yielding floating point precision so both training and detection with lbp are several times faster then with haar features regarding the lbp and haar detection quality it mainly depends on the training data used and the training parameters selected its possible to train a lbp based classifier that will provide almost the same quality as haar based one within a percentage of the training time the newer cascade classifier detection interface from opencv x and opencv x cv cascadeclassifier supports working with both old and new model formats opencv traincascade can even save export a trained cascade in the older format if for some reason you are stuck using the old interface at least training the model could then be done in the most stable interface the opencv traincascade application can use tbb for multi threading to use it in multicore mode opencv must be built with tbb support enabled preparation of the training data for training a boosted cascade of weak classifiers we need a set of positive samples containing actual objects you want to detect and a set of negative images containing everything you do not want to detect the set of negative samples must be prepared manually whereas set of positive samples is created using the opencv createsamples application negative samples negative samples are taken from arbitrary images not containing objects you want to detect these negative images from which the samples are generated should be listed in a special negative image file containing one image path per line can be absolute or relative note that negative samples and sample images are also called background samples or background images and are used interchangeably in this document described images may be of different sizes however each image should be equal or larger than the desired training window size which corresponds to the model dimensions most of the times being the average size of your object because these images are used to subsample a given negative image into several image samples having this training window size an example of such a negative description file directory structure img img jpg img jpg bg txt file bg txt img img jpg img img jpg your set of negative window samples will be used to tell the machine learning step boosting in this case what not to look for when trying to find your objects of interest positive samples positive samples are created by the opencv createsamples application they are used by the boosting process to define what the model should actually look for when trying to find your objects of interest the application supports two ways of generating a positive sample dataset you can generate a bunch of positives from a single positive object image you can supply all the positives yourself and only use the tool to cut them out resize them and put them in the opencv needed binary format while the first approach works decently for fixed objects like very rigid logos it tends to fail rather soon for less rigid objects in that case we do suggest to use the second approach many tutorials on the web even state that real object images can lead to a better model than artificially generated positives by using the opencv createsamples application if you however do decide to take the first approach keep some things in mind please note that you need more than a single positive samples before you give it to the mentioned application because it only applies perspective transformation if you want a robust model take samples that cover the wide range of varieties that can occur within your object class for example in the case of faces you should consider different races and age groups emotions and perhaps beard styles this also applies when using the second approach the first approach takes a single object image with for example a company logo and creates a large set of positive samples from the given object image by randomly rotating the object changing the image intensity as well as placing the image on arbitrary backgrounds the amount and range of randomness can be controlled by command line arguments of the opencv createsamples application command line arguments vec vec file name name of the output file containing the positive samples for training img image file name source object image e g a company logo bg background file name background description file contains a list of images which are used as a background for randomly distorted versions of the object num number of samples number of positive samples to generate bgcolor background color background color currently grayscale images are assumed the background color denotes the transparent color since there might be compression artifacts the amount of color tolerance can be specified by bgthresh all pixels within bgcolor bgthresh and bgcolor bgthresh range are interpreted as transparent bgthresh background color threshold inv if specified colors will be inverted randinv if specified colors will be inverted randomly maxidev max intensity deviation maximal intensity deviation of pixels in foreground samples maxxangle max x rotation angle maximal rotation angle towards x axis must be given in radians maxyangle max y rotation angle maximal rotation angle towards y axis must be given in radians maxzangle max z rotation angle maximal rotation angle towards z axis must be given in radians show useful debugging option if specified each sample will be shown pressing esc will continue the samples creation process without showing each sample w sample width width in pixels of the output samples h sample height height in pixels of the output samples when running opencv createsamples in this way the following procedure is used to create a sample object instance the given source image is rotated randomly around all three axes the chosen angle is limited by maxxangle maxyangle and maxzangle then pixels having the intensity from the bg color bg color threshold bg color bg color threshold range are interpreted as transparent white noise is added to the intensities of the foreground if the inv key is specified then foreground pixel intensities are inverted if randinv key is specified then algorithm randomly selects whether inversion should be applied to this sample finally the obtained image is placed onto an arbitrary background from the background description file resized to the desired size specified by w and h and stored to the vec file specified by the vec command line option positive samples also may be obtained from a collection of previously marked up images which is the desired way when building robust object models this collection is described by a text file similar to the background description file each line of this file corresponds to an image the first element of the line is the filename followed by the number of object annotations followed by numbers describing the coordinates of the objects bounding rectangles x y width height an example of description file directory structure img img jpg img jpg info dat file info dat img img jpg img img jpg image img jpg contains single object instance with the following coordinates of bounding rectangle image img jpg contains two object instances in order to create positive samples from such collection info argument should be specified instead of img info collection file name description file of marked up images collection note that in this case parameters like bg bgcolor bgthreshold inv randinv maxxangle maxyangle maxzangle are simply ignored and not used anymore the scheme of samples creation in this case is as follows the object instances are taken from the given images by cutting out the supplied bounding boxes from the original images then they are resized to target samples size defined by w and h and stored in output vec file defined by the vec parameter no distortion is applied so the only affecting arguments are w h show and num the manual process of creating the info file can also been done by using the opencv annotation tool this is an open source tool for visually selecting the regions of interest of your object instances in any given images the following subsection will discuss in more detail on how to use this application extra remarks opencv createsamples utility may be used for examining samples stored in any given positive samples file in order to do this only vec w and h parameters should be specified example of vec file is available here opencv data vec files trainingfaces vec it can be used to train a face detector with the following window size w h using opencvs integrated annotation tool since opencv x the community has been supplying and maintaining a open source annotation tool used for generating the info file the tool can be accessed by the command opencv annotation if the opencv applications where build using the tool is quite straightforward the tool accepts several required and some optional parameters annotations required path to annotations txt file where you want to store your annotations which is then passed to the info parameter example data annotations txt images required path to folder containing the images with your objects example data testimages maxwindowheight optional if the input image is larger in height then the given resolution here resize the image for easier annotation using resizefactor resizefactor optional factor used to resize the input image when using the maxwindowheight parameter note that the optional parameters can only be used together an example of a command that could be used can be seen below opencv annotation annotations path to annotations file txt images path to image folder this command will fire up a window containing the first image and your mouse cursor which will be used for annotation a video on how to use the annotation tool can be found here basically there are several keystrokes that trigger an action the left mouse button is used to select the first corner of your object then keeps drawing until you are fine and stops when a second left mouse button click is registered after each selection you have the following choices pressing c confirm the annotation turning the annotation green and confirming it is stored pressing d delete the last annotation from the list of annotations easy for removing wrong annotations pressing n continue to the next image pressing esc this will exit the annotation software finally you will end up with a usable annotation file that can be passed to the info argument of opencv createsamples cascade training the next step is the actual training of the boosted cascade of weak classifiers based on the positive and negative dataset that was prepared beforehand command line

traincascade application has finished its work the trained cascade will be saved in cascade xml file in the data folder other files in this folder are created for the case of interrupted training so you may delete them after completion of training training is finished and you can test your cascade classifier visualising cascade classifiers from time to time it can be useful to visualise the trained cascade to see which features it selected and how complex its stages are for this opencv supplies a opencv visualisation application this application has the following commands image required

facebooktwitterinstagramyoutubelinkedinrss join the conversation control of semiconductor switches via pwm technologies control of the semiconductor switches is the most efficient and convenient means to achieve the control of power converters and machine drives they act as the actuators in the implementation of the control systems where the manipulated control inputs in the form of three phase voltage signals are realized by turning on and off the semiconductor switches depending on the application a large variety of power electronic devices different in types of semiconductor switches construction topologies and concepts have been developed the common functionality of these devices is to conduct power flow by varying the on off duration of each switch among them the level voltage source inverter l vsi as shown in figure is the most widely adopted mechanism to control three phase ac machines a similar topology is illustrated in the previous chapter for the power converter see figure based on a dc power supply for controlling ac motors the primary concern of using the semiconductor switches for the applications presented in this book is to create sinusoidal phase voltage signals via the fundamental components of rectangular signals that are produced by varying magnitudes and frequencies through turning on off each power switch for a duration of time a similar operational principle applies to the voltage source power converter see figure the command signal for turning on off each power switch is called a gate signal there are two approaches used in this book to generate the gate signal for the semiconductor switches the first approach uses pulse width modulation pwm based on which the pid controllers see chapters to and the traditional model predictive controllers see chapters to are implemented in the control applications the control signals calculated are the three phase voltage signals that are obtained from one of the controller designs using the model either in the d q reference frame or in reference frame the role of the voltage source inverter with the power electronics devices is to realize the three phase voltage control signals as closely as possible namely the sinusoidal phase voltage signals contained as fundamental components of rectangular wave signals created by turning on off each power switch with the pwm technologies are aimed to be closely matched with the three phase voltage control signals the second methodology features a much simpler approach in the implementation of the control systems that generates such a gate signal by direct optimization of an error function between the desired control signals and those achieved by the semiconductor switches see chapters to in this second approach there is no need to use the pwm technology therefore it significantly reduces the complexity of controlling the semiconductor switches pwm technology originally developed in the telecommunication engineering community has gained wide popularity and has been the subject of intensive research investigations in the control of power pid and predictive control of electrical drives and power

technology and a voltage source inverter the efficient control of the ac motor position speed and torque by variable speed drive vsd becomes possible power converters are also controlled by the pwm technology a wide variety of pwm generation techniques has been developed which could be categorized into two broad classes continuous pwm cpwm and discontinuous pwm dpwm hava et al zhou and wang compared with dpwm cpwm attains superior performance in the low modulation index range which is within the operating conditions of servo drives and the power converters for most of the time therefore it has gained more popularity in servo drive and converter applications these methods could be implemented by two methodologies carrier based pwm and direct digital implementation for a long time the carrier based pwm implementation such as sine triangle intersection techniques has dominated the industrial applications with the development of fast digital signal processors dsps direct digital implementation has also gained popularity in more recent years of which the space vector modulator svm has been well recognized in section the topology of a two level voltage source inverter is introduced where the relationship between the semiconductor power switches and the three phase sinusoidal control signal is established the remainder of this chapter discusses how to manage the semiconductor power switches so that the three phase sinusoidal control signal can be reconstructed in section the six step mode is introduced in section several carrier based pwm techniques are discussed among which zero sequence techniques are used to improve the modulation index section discusses the space vector modulation which has a direct digital implementation in section a simulation study of the effect of pwm is conducted to reveal the current ripples topology of igbt inverter one of the most widely adopted semiconductor power switches for the medium range power converter inverter is the insulated gate bipolar transistor igbt which offers the benefits of both mosfet and bipolar switches however igbt can only allow the current to flow in one direction and hence a freewheeling diode in parallel is required to conduct the current flow in the opposite direction in the three phase l vsi for controlling ac machine as shown in figure each leg of the inverter has two pairs of such a combination consisting of an igbt switch and a freewheeling diode where their middle point is linked to the loads either a passive load or an ac motor here the front end rectifier is replaced by two dc sources connected in series and each supply offers half of the total dc bus voltage vdc for the simplification of analysis it is sufficient to assume that the middle point denoted by o in figure between two dc sources is referred to the ground thus all the voltages can be represented with respect to the ground for example the neutral point voltage of ac motor is referred to as n with respect to the ground vdc vdc c s a s a sb sb s c s c l r vn va vb vc o r r l l figure topology of three phase leg igbt control of semiconductor switches via pwm technologies as seen in figure there are two igbt switches for each of the three legs within each leg of an inverter only one switch is allowed to turn on denoted by while the other is off denoted by at any given time to prevent short circuit thus the switching states of the inverter can be identified by only considering the states of the three upper switches with the states of three upper switches denoted as s i i a b c the states of their corresponding lower switches can be represented by their negation si i a b c as a result there are only eight possible switching states by turning on and off all the switches in the inverter since the states of upper and lower switches within the same leg are complementary to each other all eight switching states can be independently identified by the states of the three upper switches as listed in table among these two switching states v and v which represent the cases where either all the upper or all the lower switches are turned on leading to an open circuit are called zero vector in contrast the other six states that form a closed circuit are called active vector when the ith upper switch is on that is si and si the output of the corresponding phase leg is connected to the top rail of the supplies and thus i v dc conversely when the lower switch is on the output is connected to the bottom rail of the supplies and hence i v dc corresponding to the switching states in table the resulting output voltages a b c are summarized in table equivalently the output voltages could be represented in terms of their switching states i vdcsi v dc i a b c note that the output voltages are expressed with respect to the ground defined before it follows that the three phase voltages with respect to the neutral point of the load are obtained by an a n bn b n cn c n from it is seen that the three voltage signals a b and c generated from the voltage source inverter via the semiconductor switches are in rectangular wave forms with amplitude changes between table switching states of inverter v v v v v v v v s a s b s c table output voltage of inverter v v v v v v v v a v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc b v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc v dc c v

in the realization of the three phase control signals six step operating mode one of early technologies to control the power electronic switches is called six step mode see holtz in this approach the maximum magnitude of the fundamental with a l vsi is achieved by sequentially switching the six active vectors that is starting from v to v and the on to v within one electrical cycle for one cycle of the six step operation each output voltage i i a b c will have half of cycle connect to top rail of inverter and the other half bottom rail as an example figure illustrates the rectangular wave of c over one cycle and its associated fundamental where the period of the wave is e since this rectangular signal c is an odd function it can be approximated using a fourier sine series as see kreyszig where c t b sin et b sin et bn sin n et where n is an odd number and the coefficient for the nth index is b n e e v dc sin n etdt n v dc the fundamental component of the fourier sine series b sin et is the approximated sinusoidal output of the voltage source inverter for the third phase of the voltage and is the function to be closely matched with the control signal at this phase the rest of the components in the fourier sine series are the harmonics the fourier coefficient b v dc represents the amplitude of the fundamental component of the rectangular wave c t generated by one cycle of the six step operation this amplitude of the fundamental voltage of six step mode limits the maximum amplitude of the achievable modulation signal in other words the maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage signals that is achievable when using the six step mode is v dc from a control system design point of view this means that if the calculated control signal had an amplitude that exceeded this value then the output of the inverter would not be able to fully realize it one of the drawbacks for the six step mode technique is that the amplitudes of the harmonics decay in a linear way proportional to the index n in particular the third harmonic still has a relatively large amplitude see that only becomes one third of the fundamental component from a control system perspective the harmonics become part of the noise and disturbances of the system therefore their amplitudes should be minimized this means that the six step mode technique will create large noise effects and disturbances in the control system vdc e e vdc figure output c of six step mode control of semiconductor switches via pwm technologies carrier based pwm use of the six step mode to control the power electronic switches is relatively simple in implementation however this approach has large harmonic components relative to the amplitude of the fundamental component of the output voltage signal which is v dc to reduce the effects of the harmonics carrier based pulse width modulation pwm techniques with zero sequence injection are introduced in general the carrier based pwm technique is to compare the amplitude of an input voltage signal with that of a carrier signal usually a periodic triangular signal with frequency fc if the input voltage signal say phase a voltage a is larger than the carrier in amplitude the switch function sa outputs high level logic and otherwise low level logic leading to the actual voltage output calculated as a vdcsa v dc the carrier frequency denoted by fc is usually chosen to be much higher than the fundamental frequency denoted by f of the voltage signal and their ratio is the multiple of for better reduction of total harmonic distortion thd see holmes and lipo for example a ratio fs f could be used for this purpose sinusoidal pwm as one of the earliest pwm generation techniques see bowes the sinusoidal pwm spwm generates the digital pulses to control the igbt switches by directly comparing the three phase voltages with the carrier commonly a periodic triangular waveform it was popular due to its simplicity and feasibility to be implemented by analog circuits as an example to demonstrate the working principle of sinusoidal pwm technique a carrier signal and three phase sinusoidal signals are shown in figure where the fundamental frequency of the sinusoidal signals is f and the carrier frequency is fc and fc f the carrier signal has amplitude of vdc where vdc is the dc voltage of the power supply for the control application of ac drives or vdc as the dc voltage output for the control application of power converter in this illustration there are cycles of the carrier signal and one cycle of the three phase sinusoidal signals see figure a when comparing the three phase sinusoidal signals with the carrier signal the values of s a sb and sc are taken either or depending on whether the corresponding sinusoidal function is greater or smaller than the carrier signal the actual output voltages are in rectangular waveforms see figure b with their magnitudes being vdc and their switches dependent on the values of sa sb and s c i vdcsi v dc i a b c the fundamental components of the three rectangular waves in figure b are found through fourier series analysis and are shown in the corresponding plots it is seen that they have similar characteristics as the input sinusoidal signals shown in figure a however for the modulation to work within the linear range where its fundamental resembles the desired signal it requires that the maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal signal be less than vdc otherwise the exceeding parts will cause the switch states stay at either or and thus the fundamentals lose their linear relationship to the desired reference voltage signals as a result the controller output voltage should limit its value within vdc to avoid the nonlinear modulation region if the sinusoidal pwm technique is used the maximum modulation range could be improved by zero sequence injection which has led to several different modulation schemes as introduced below pid and predictive

sequence injection the existence of a zero sequence is examined for a three phase system let a m sin et b m sin et c m sin et control of semiconductor switches via pwm technologies zero sequence s a sb s c v a vb v c figure carrier based pwm with zero sequence injection hava et al denote the desired reference voltages that will be closely approximated by the outputs of the voltage source inverter the neutral point voltage n with respect to ground shown in figure can be represented by n a b c if the desired three phase voltage a b and c are balanced it means that the neutral point voltage n equals because most balanced three phase motors are three wired systems with the isolated neutral point there is the freedom of adding a nonzero value voltage to the neutral point voltage n leading to the modified three desired voltage signals a a n b b n c c n then based on the modified three desired voltage signals the sinusoidal pwm technique explained in the previous section can be applied figure illustrates the operation of the carrier based pwm technique with zero sequence injection which shows that the same zero sequence is added to all three reference voltage signals and these signals are compared with the carrier signal to produce the switching signals s a sb and sc there are many approaches in choosing the zero sequence signal leading to a variety of carrier based pwm schemes in the literatures see hava et al amongst them a commonly encountered selection of the zero sequence signal for injection is the third harmonic injection pwm technique third harmonics injection pwm thipwm exploits the third harmonic component of the desired reference signal as the injection signal there are two types of injections with different amplitudes of the third harmonic with the desired reference voltage defined in the thipwm with one sixth of the reference amplitude is given by n m sin et similarly the thipwm is given by n m sin et pid and predictive control of electrical drives and power converters using matlab simulink figure waveform of thipwm key dashed line original sinusoidal wave dotted line m sin et solid line sinusoidal wave with third harmonic injection with the third harmonics injection the peak value of modified desired sinusoidal is reduced by the injection as the waveform in figure demonstrates it can shown that the maximum amplitude of the three phase voltage signals is reduced to v dc v dc if the thipwm is used and to v dc if the thipwm technique is used the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the three phase voltage signals and the value vdc is called the modulation index which is m max thipwm vdc v dc for the thipwm and m max thipwm vdc v dc for the thipwm both modulation indices indicate that the linear modulation range is larger than the one generated by the original sinusoidal pwm note that thipwm is derived for the purpose of the minimization of the total harmonic distortion thd whereas thipwm is designed based on maximizing the linear modulation range see bowes and lai now with the third harmonic injection technique for the modulation to work within the linear range where its fundamental resembles the desired signal it requires that the maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal signal be less than vdc or v dc depending on whether thipwm or thipwm is being used basically the modulation index will quantify the linear modulation range of the three phase voltage signals with respect to the results from the original sinusoidal pwm the linear modulation range is translated into operational constraints from the perspective of controller design in later chapters control of semiconductor switches via pwm technologies space vector pwm space vector pwm svpwm as its name conveys utilizes the concept of space vector and its geometrical features to derive the on off time duration for each switch similar to the definition of mmf space vector in the space vector of three phase reference voltage is defined as vs an bnej cnej if a balanced three phase voltage is employed then v s is a rotating vector with electrical speed e which is the frequency of sinusoidal signal the modulation of the desired space vector v s is obtained by the time average of its two nearest active vectors and a zero vector either v or v taking the first sector for example as illustrated in figure vs could be modulated with the time average of the active vector v and v within one sampling period ts by ts vs t v t v where t and t are the duration of on time for the active vectors v and v respectively the relationship between the modulated vector v s and two nearest active vectors is obtained by applying the geometric properties of the triangle ts v s sin t v sin t v sin that implies the duty cycle ratio of each active vector is t ts v s v dc sin sin v s v dc sin t ts v s v dc sin sin v s v dc sin v v v v v v vi vdc v v v max vdc t t vs ts vs t v t v t t ts t t figure principle of svm pid and predictive control of electrical drives and power converters using matlab simulink where the length of each active vector vi vdc is used it follows that the duration of the zero vector applied is the remaining time of the sampling period t t ts t t since the hexagon has sixfold symmetry the geometrical method discussed above can be used for the other five sectors as well by rotating the modulation vector by m rads with m denoting the sector in which it locates the conventional svpwm symmetrically distributes the four switching vectors two active vectors and two zero vectors within one sampling time as shown in figure such an arrangement offers the benefits of fixed switching frequency and better harmonics reduction performance figure shows a digital implementation of svpwm within one sampling period for the example illustrated in figure there are four switching vectors denoted by v v v v corresponding to the four on time periods t t t and t calculated using the arrangement of the four switching vectors is shown in the top part of figure together with the three switching states sa sb and s c it is seen that the arrangement begins with the zero vector v and ends with the zero vector v for the first half and symmetrical with the second half of the graph this forms a symmetrical pattern from the center of the graph the individual on time period is also illustrated in the top part of figure the bottom part of figure illustrates how spvpwm is implemented in the direct digital implementation a parameter max is selected and a internal counter is set to count up and down within one sampling

reverse namely when pwmtime pwms c and pwm time is decreasing the switching state sc the same conditions apply to the switching states sb and sa to complete one cycle of space vector implementation of pwm the maximum amplitude of the three phase voltage signals to be realized by the space vector modulation technique is seen from figure which is vdc thus the modulation index is calculated as m svpwm to ensure that the modulation is within the linear modulation range it requires that voltages in the reference frame satisfy t t vdc this is based on the definition of the voltage space vector in relation to the voltage variables in reference frame see similarly the voltages in the d q reference frame are also required to satisfy d t q t vdc based on the definition of the voltage space vector in relation to those in the d q reference frame see the inequalities and will be used as constraints in the control system design and implementation see chapter note that the maximum amplitude of the three phase voltage signals when using the pwm with the third harmonic injection technique is identical to the case when using the space vector modulation technique which is vdc thus in the applications the limit on the amplitude of the control signal is often taken as vdc simulation study of the effect of pwm since the time varying input voltages for ac drives and power converter are to be realized by the pwm generation and inverter taking the pmsm as an example the complete plant model as shown in figure consists of machine model of pmsm pwm and igbt inverters note that figure is an equivalent representation in d q frame which does not illustrate the real hardware implementation in three phase representation when the modulation signal i works within the linear modulation region of chosen pwm the fundamental of output voltage i from the igbt inverter approximates the desired modulation signal that is i i with the combination of park clarke and its inverse transformation of which their multiplication is an identity matrix it is assumed that d d and q q when using igbt inverters as actuators for controller implementation pid and predictive control of electrical drives and

model illustrated in figure the first set of simulation results uses a smaller pwm carrier frequency where fc khz in contrast with the second set of simulation results where a larger carrier frequency fc khz is utilized the voltage input signals to the pmsm model are set as d v and q v and the dc bus voltage is fixed at v so that the modulation signal is within its linear modulation range figure a shows the three phase currents time s phase current a i a ib i c a frequency khz normalized ampitude b figure spectrum of phase currents fc khz d v and q v control of semiconductor switches via pwm technologies and figure b shows the corresponding spectrum of a phase current for the lower carrier frequency case it is seen that with this lower carrier frequency the ia ib and ic currents contain a large amount of high frequency harmonic noise see figure a and the harmonics mainly occur around the carrier frequency and its multiples see figure b that is n khz with n denoting an integer in this case when the carrier frequency is increased to fc khz the high frequency harmonic noise in the three phase currents is reduced as seen in figure a and the current ripple still occurs at the carrier frequency see figure b but the multiples move to the high frequency region at a certain high frequency region the current ripple is then attenuated by the limited bandwidth of the pmsm which is a first order type of system depending on the values of resistance rs and inductance ld lq in summary the high frequency harmonic ripple with a low carrier frequency is much more severe than the one with a high carrier frequency and the harmonics occur around the carrier frequency and its multiples thus a higher carrier frequency in pwm offers improved performance in terms harmonics attenuation

electrical drives and power converters using matlab simulink summary two popular categories of pwm techniques carrier based pwm and space vector based pwm have also been briefly revisited it has been shown in zhou and wang that both implementation approaches can lead to the same type of pwm such as svpwm thipwm and several variations of discontinuous pwm dpwm schemes see hava et al zhou and wang the implementation of these pwm schemes is achieved by appropriate zero sequence injection in the carrier based pwm approach while its corresponding equivalence is the varieties of the placement of zero vector in the space vector based pwm approach the maximum modulation index of the linear modulation ranges for different pwm is discussed simulation results show that the pwm techniques have a

maintains acceptable performance in the presence of significant model uncertainty disturbances and noise a system structure that incorporates system uncertainties is shown in figure this model includes the sensor noise n s the disturbance input td s and a process g s with unmodeled dynamics or parameter changes the chapter robust control systems unmodeled dynamics and parameter changes may be significant and for these systems the challenge is to create a design that retains the desired performance robust control systems and system sensitivity designing highly accurate systems in the presence of significant plant uncertainty is a classical feedback design problem the theoretical bases for the solution of this problem date back to the works of h s black and h w bode in the early s when this problem was referred to as the sensitivities design problem a significant amount of literature has been published since then regarding the design of systems subject to large process uncertainty the designer seeks to obtain a system that performs adequately over a large range of uncertain parameters a system is said to be robust when it is durable hardy and resilient a control system is robust when it has low sensitivities it is stable over the expected range of parameter variations and the performance continues to meet the specifications in the presence of a set of changes in the system parameters robustness is the low sensitivity to effects that are not considered in the analysis and design phase for example disturbances measurement noise and unmodeled dynamics the system should be able to withstand these neglected effects when performing the tasks for which it was designed for small parameter perturbations we may use as a measure of robustness the differential sensitivities discussed in sections system sensitivity and section root sensitivity the system sensitivity is defined as s ta t t a a where a is the parameter and t the transfer function of the system the root sensitivity is defined as s ria ri a a when the zeros of t s are independent of the parameter a we showed that s ta a n i s ria s ri for an nth order system for example if we have a closed loop system as shown in figure where the variable parameter is a then t s s a and s ta a s a this follows because r a and s ria a section robust control systems and system sensitivity therefore s ta s

condition z and vn kp then kd vn to achieve z therefore we may plot log s and log t on a bode plot as shown in figure note that the frequency vn is an indicator on the boundary between the frequency region in which the sensitivity is the important design criterion and the region in which the stability margin is important thus if we specify vn properly to take into consideration the extent of modeling error and the frequency of external disturbance we can expect the system to have an acceptable amount of robustness example system with a right hand plane zero consider the system shown in

of robustness system goals include maintaining a small tracking error for an input r s and keeping the output y s small for a disturbance td s the sensitivity function is s s g c s g s and the complementary sensitivity function is c s g c s g s g c s g s we also have the relationship s s c s for physically realizable systems the loop gain l s gc s g s is small for high frequencies this means that s jv approaches at high frequencies consider the closed loop system shown in figure an additive perturbation characterizes the set of possible processes as follows g a s g s a s where g s is the nominal process and a s is the perturbation that is bounded in magnitude we assume that ga s and g s have the same number of poles in the right hand s plane if any then the system stability will not change if a jv gc jv g jv for all v this assures stability but not dynamic performance a multiplicative perturbation is modeled as g m s g s m s the perturbation is bounded in magnitude and it is again assumed that gm s and g s have the same number of poles in the right hand s plane then the system stability will not change if m jv gc jv g jv for all v equation is called the robust stability criterion this is a test for robustness with respect to a multiplicative perturbation this form of perturbation is often usedsection analysis of robustness because it satisfies the intuitive properties of being small at low frequencies where the nominal process model is usually well known and being large at high frequencies where the nominal model is always inexact example system with multiplicative perturbation consider the system of figure with gc k and g s s s s s s the system is unstable with k but a reduction in gain to k will stabilize it now consider the effect of an unmodeled pole at rad s in this case the multiplicative perturbation is determined from m s s or m s s s the magnitude bound is then m jv jv jv m jv and kg jv are shown in figure a where it is seen that the criterion of equation is not satisfied thus the system may not be stable if we use a lag compensator g c s s s the loop transfer function is l s gc s g s we reshape the function g c jv g jv in the frequency range v and check the condition m jv gc jv g jv as shown in figure b here the robustness inequality is satisfied and the system is robustly stable the control objective is to design a compensator gc s so that the transient steady state and frequency domain specifications are achieved and the cost of feedback measured by the bandwidth of the compensator gc jv is sufficiently small this bandwidth constraint is needed mainly because of measurement noise in subsequent sections we discuss including a pre filter in a two degree of freedom configuration to help achieve the design goals chapter robust control systems systems with uncertain parameters many systems have several parameters that are constants but uncertain within a range for example consider a system with a characteristic equation sn a n sn an sn g a with known coefficients within bounds ai ai bi and i c n where a n to ascertain the stability of the system we might have to investigate all possible combinations of parameters fortunately it is possible to investigate a limited number of worst case polynomials the analysis of only four polynomials is frequency rad s frequency rad s a b magnitude

system with a characteristic equation s a s a s a the four polynomials are q s s a s b s b q s s b s a s a q s s b s b s a q s s a s a s b one of the four polynomials represents the worst case and may indicate either unstable performance or at least the worst performance for the system in that case example third order system with uncertain parameters consider a third order system with uncertain coefficients such that a a b a a b a a b the four polynomials are q s s s s q s s s s q s s s s q s s s s we then proceed to check these four polynomials by means of the routh hurwitz criterion and determine that the system is stable for all the range of uncertain parameters example stability of uncertain system consider a unity feedback system with a process transfer function under nominal conditions g s s s s the nominal characteristic equation is then q s s s s where a a and a using the routh hurwitz criterion we find that this system is nominally stable however if the system has uncertain coefficients such that a a b a a b and a a b chapter robust control systems then we must examine the four polynomials q s s s s q s s s s q s s s s q s s s s using the routh hurwitz criterion q s and q s are stable and q s is marginally stable for q s we have s s s s therefore the system is unstable for the worst case where a minimum a minimum and b maximum this occurs when the process has changed to g s s s s note that the third pole has moved toward the jv axis to its limit at s and that the gain has increased to its limit at k the design of robust control systems the design of robust control systems involves determining the structure of the controller and adjusting the controller parameters to achieve acceptable performance in the presence of uncertainty the structure of the controller is chosen such that the system response can meet certain performance criteria one possible objective in the design of a control system is that the controlled system output should very accurately track the input that is we want to minimize the tracking error in an ideal setting the bode plot of the loop gain l s would be db gain of infinite bandwidth and zero phase shift in practice this is not possible one possible design objective is to maintain the magnitude response curve as flat and as close to unity for as large a bandwidth as possible for a given plant and controller combination another important goal of a control system design is that the effect on the output of the system due to disturbances is minimized consider the control system shown in figure where g s is the plant and td s is the disturbance we then have t s y s r s g c s g s g c s g s section the design of robust control systems and y s td s g s g c s g s note that both the reference and disturbance transfer functions have the same denominator in other words they have the same characteristic equation namely g c s g s l s recall that the sensitivity of t s with respect to g s is sg t g c s g s equation shows that for low sensitivity we desire a high value of loop gain l jv but it is known that a high gain can lead to instability and amplification of the measurement noise thus we seek the following t s with wide bandwidth large loop gain l s at low frequencies small loop gain l s at high frequencies setting the design of robust systems in frequency domain terms we scale a compensator gc s such that the closed loop sensitivity is less than some tolerance value but sensitivity minimization involves finding a compensator such that the closed loop sensitivity is minimized the gain and phase margin problem is to find a compensator to achieve prescribed gain and phase margins the disturbance rejection problem and measurement noise attenuation problem seeks a solution with high loop gain at low frequencies and low loop gain at high frequencies respectively for the frequency domain specifications we seek the following conditions for the bode plot of gc jv g jv shown in figure for relative stability the loop gain must have not more than a db decade slope at or near the crossover frequency vc steady state accuracy and measurement noise rejection achieved by the low

l yields a near minimum sensitivity while maintaining good performance for the step response to reduce the root sensitivity while simultaneously minimizing the effect of disturbances we can use the design procedure as follows sketch the root locus of the compensated system with gc s chosen to attain the desired location for the dominant roots maximize the gain of gc s to reduce the effect of the disturbance determine sk r and attain the minimum value of the root sensitivity consistent with the transient response required as described in step log gcg minimum performance bounds high gains for

the allowable magnitude of u s figure when kd is large if kd is the system has a fast response and zero steady state error furthermore the effect of the disturbance is reduced significantly in general we note that pid controllers are particularly useful for reducing steady state error and improving the transient response when g s has one or two poles or may be approximated by a second order process the main problem in the selection of the three pid controller parameters is that these coefficients do not readily translate into the desired performance and robustness characteristics that the control system designer has in mind several rules and methods have been proposed to solve this problem in this section we consider several design methods using root locus and performance indices the first design method uses the itae performance index hence we select the three pid coefficients to minimize the itae performance index which produces r s y s ea s u s td s gp s gc s g s figure feedback

appropriate optimum equation table and the v n of step to obtain gc s determine a prefilter gp s so that the closed loop system transfer function t s does not have any zeros example robust control of temperature consider a temperature controller with a control system as shown in figure and a process g s s if g c s the steady state error is ess and the settling time with a criterion is ts s for a step input we want to obtain an optimum itae performance for a step input and a settling time of ts s using a pid controller we have t s y s r s g c s g s g c s g s kds kps ki s kd s kp s ki where g p s the optimum coefficients of the characteristic equation for itae are s v ns vn s vn we need to select v n in order to meet the settling time requirement since ts zvn and z is unknown but near we set

has a percent overshoot of p o as recorded in table we select a prefilter gp s so that we achieve the desired itae response with t s g c s g s gp s g c s g s s s s chapter robust control systems table results for example controller g c s pid and gp s pid with gp s prefilter percent overshoot settling time seconds steady state error disturbance error therefore we require that gp s s s in order to eliminate the zeros in equation and bring the overall numerator to the response of the system t s to a step input is indicated in table the system has a small percent overshoot a settling time of ts s and zero steady state error furthermore for a disturbance td s s the maximum value of y t due to the disturbance is of the magnitude of the disturbance this is a very favorable design let us consider the system when the plant varies significantly so that g s k ts where t and k we want to achieve investigate the behavior using the itae optimum system with the prefilter the objective is to have an overshoot of p o and a settling time with a criterion of ts s while g s can attain any value in the range indicated we then obtain the step response for the four conditions t k t k t k and t k the results are summarized in figure this is a very robust system the value of v n that can be chosen will be limited by considering the maximum allowable u t where u t is the output of the controller as shown in figure as an example consider the system in figure with a pid controller g s s s and the necessary prefilter gp s to achieve itae performance if we select v n and the maximum value of u t is as recorded in table if we wish to limit u t we need to limit vn thus we are limited in the settling time we can achieve the robust internal model control system the internal model control system is shown in figure we now consider the use of the internal model design with special attention to robust system performance the internal model principle states that if gc s g s contains r s then y s will track r s asymptotically in the steady state and the tracking is robust section the robust internal model control system consider a simple system with g s s for which we seek a ramp response with a steady state error of zero a pi controller is sufficient and we let k no state variable feedback then we have g c s g s kp ksi s kpss ki note that for a ramp r s s which is contained as a factor of

for a ramp response we require that t s v ns vn s v ns vn we select v n to satisfy a specification for the settling time for a settling time with a criterion of ts s we select vn then we require kp and ki the response of this system settles in ts s and then tracks the ramp with zero steady state error if this system designed for a ramp input receives a step input the response has a percent overshoot of p o and a settling time of ts s this system is very robust to changes in the plant for example if g s k s changes gain so that k varies by the change in the ramp response is insignificant example design of an internal model control system consider the system of figure with state variable feedback and a compensator g c s we wish to track a step input with zero steady state error here we select a pid controller for g c s we then have g c s kds kps ki s and g s gc s will contain r s s the input command note that we feed back both state variables and add these additional signals after gc s in order to retain the integrator in gc s the goal is to achieve a settling time to within of the final value of ts second and a deadbeat response while retaining a robust response here we assume that the two poles of g s can change by then the worst case condition is gn s s s one design approach is to design the control for this worst case condition another approach which we use here is to design for the nominal g s and one half the desired settling time then we expect to meet the settling time requirement and attain a very fast highly robust system note that the prefilter gp s is used to attain the desired form for t s r s y s process g s x s x s g gp s c s s ka kb s figure an internal model control with state variable feedback and g c s section design examples the response desired

of the system of figure with the appropriate gp s is t s ki s kd kb s kp ka kb s ki we let k a kb kp ki and kd note that t s could be achieved with other gain combinations the step response of this system has a deadbeat response with a percent overshoot of p o and a settling time of ts s when the poles of g s change by the percent overshoot changes to p o and the settling time is t s s this is an outstanding design of a robust deadbeat response system design examples in this section we present two illustrative examples the first example illustrates the design of two degree of freedom controllers that is two separate controllers for an ultra precision diamond turning machine in the second design example we consider the practical problem of designing a controller in the presence of an uncertain time delay the specific problem under investigation is a pid controller for a digital audio tape drive the design process is highlighted with an emphasis on robustness example ultra precision diamond turning machine the design of an ultra precision diamond turning machine has been studied at lawrence livermore national laboratory this machine shapes optical devices such as mirrors with ultra high precision using a diamond tool as the cutting device in this discussion we will consider only the z axis control using frequency response identification with sinusoidal input to the actuator we determined that g s s the system can accommodate high gains since the input command is a series of step commands of very small magnitude a fraction of a micron the system has an outer loop for position feedback using a laser interferometer with an accuracy of micron m an inner feedback loop is also used for velocity feedback as shown in figure chapter robust control systems we want to select the controllers g s and g s to obtain an overdamped highly robust high bandwidth system the robust system must accommodate changes in g s due to varying loads materials and cutting requirements thus we seek a large phase margin and gain margin for the inner and outer loops and low root sensitivity the specifications are summarized in table since we want zero steady state error

to represent the time delay uncertainty in the form shown in figure where we need to determine a function m s that approximately models the time delay this will lead to the establishment of a straightforward method of testing the system for stability robustness in the presence of the uncertain time delay the uncertainty model is known as a multiplicative uncertainty representation since we are concerned with stability we can consider r s then we can manipulate the block diagram in figure to obtain the form shown in figure using the small gain theorem we have the condition that the

the challenge is that the time delay t is not known exactly one approach to solving the problem is to find a weighting function denoted by w s such that e jvt w jv for all v and t t t if w s satisfies the inequality in equation it follows that m jv w jv therefore the robust stability condition can be satisfied by w jv gc jv g jv for all v this is a conservative bound if the condition in equation is satisfied then stability is guaranteed in the presence of any time delay in the range t t t if the condition is not satisfied the system may or may not be stable suppose we have an uncertain time

feedback theory qft uses a controller as shown in figure to achieve robust performance the goal is to achieve a wide bandwidth for the closedloop transfer function with a high loop gain k typical qft design methods use graphical and numerical methods in conjunction with the nichols chart generally qft design seeks a high loop gain and large phase margin so that robust performance is achieved in this section we pursue a simple method of achieving the goals of qft with an s plane root locus approach to the selection of the gain k and the compensator g c s this approach dubbed pseudo qft follows these steps place the n poles and m zeros of g s on the s plane for the nth order g s also add any poles of gc s starting near the origin place the zeros of gc s immediately to the left of each of the n poles on the left hand s plane this leaves one pole far to the left of the lefthand side of the s plane increase the gain k so that the roots of the characteristic equation poles of the closedloop transfer function are close to the zeros of gc s g s this method introduces zeros so that all but one of the root loci end on finite zeros if the gain k is sufficiently large then the poles of t s are almost equal to the zeros of g c s g s this leaves one pole of t s with a significant partial fraction residue and the system with a phase margin of approximately actually about frequency

remains essentially unchanged pseudo qft design results in very robust systems robust control systems using control design software in this section we investigate robust control systems using control design software in particular we will consider the commonly used pid controller in the feedback control system shown in figure note that the system has a prefilter gp s the objective is to choose the pid parameters kp ki and kd to meet the performance specifications and have desirable robustness properties unfortunately it is not immediately clear how to choose the parameters in the pid controller to obtain certain robustness characteristics an illustrative example will show that it is possible to choose the parameters iteratively and verify the robustness by simulation using the computer helps in this process because the entire design and simulation can be automated using scripts and can easily be executed repeatedly example robust control of temperature consider the feedback control system in figure where g s s c and the nominal value is c and gp s we can design a compensator based on c and check robustness by simulation our design specifications are a settling time with a criterion ts

robustness of the design consists of a step response analysis using the pid controller given in equation for a range of plant parameter variations of c the results are displayed in figure the script is written to compute the step response for a given c it can be convenient to place the input of c at the command prompt level to make the script more interactive the simulation results indicate that the pid design is robust with respect to changes in c the differences in the step responses for c are barely discernible on the plot if the results showed otherwise it would be possible to iterate on

highly accurate control systems in the presence of significant plant uncertainty requires the designer to seek a robust control system a robust control system exhibits low sensitivities to parameter change and is stable over a wide range of parameter variations the pid controller was considered as a compensator to aid in the design of robust control systems the design issue for a pid controller

biden administration names prescription drugs for price negotiations by amy goldstein and daniel gilbert drug price negotiations between medicare and manufacturers were a significant element in last years inflation reduction act michael s williamson the washington post the biden administration tuesday identified expensive prescription drugs that will be included in price negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers as the government seeks to ease the financial burden on older and disabled americans an unprecedented step in a long political war over the nations exorbitant drug costs half of these first drugs chosen for price negotiations are medications used to prevent blood clots and treat diabetes and were taken by millions of people on medicare in the past year according to a list released by federal health officials who oversee medicare the vast public health insurance system others are used to treat heart trouble autoimmune disease and cancer consumers will not see benefits swiftly with the lower negotiated prices due to become available in early the top three of the drugs on the widely anticipated list include eliquis a blood thinner jardiance which treats diabetes and heart failure and xarelto another blood thinner they cost medicare billion billion and billion respectively in the past year medications could be targeted for price negotiation if they are available under medicare drug benefits lack certain competition to push down their prices and have been sold for at least several years to give drugmakers time to help recoup the expense of developing them tuesdays step toward reducing medicare drug prices was a significant element in last years inflation reduction act a law that president biden and his aides herald as a policy victory even though the number of medications and the timing of the first price reductions are less ambitious than some democrats had sought for many years and the fate of the entire negotiation plan rests with the courts because six drug manufacturers the chamber of commerce and the pharmaceutical industrys main trade group have lodged separate lawsuits around the country trying to block it still the biden administration democratic allies in congress and consumer health care advocates portrayed this initial list of drugs as a milestone to shore up the financial stability of the medicare system and ease the burden on its beneficiaries medicare is a federal insurance system for people who are at least along with younger adults who have disabilities when last years law passed the congressional budget office predicted the negotiations would save the program slightly more than billion during the following decade there is no reason why americans should be forced to pay more than any developed nation for life saving prescriptions just to pad big pharmas pockets biden said in a statement issued by the white house reflecting his intention to use the issue as a feature of his campaign for reelection more than percent of the million people on medicare take prescription medication and percent take at least four prescriptions according to a survey this summer by kff a health care policy organization the rest of the list consists of januvia farxiga and novolog which treat diabetes among other conditions enbrel and stelara for arthritis and psoriasis and entresto for heart failure and imbruvica for cancers of the blood wall street analysts widely expected that most of the drugs selected for price negotiations would appear on the list based on medicare expenditures and their sales in the united states among other criteria for seniors enrolled in medicare their average annual out of pocket costs ranged from for diabetes drug novolog to for cancer drug imbruvica including those with financial assistance all told hhs estimates that about million seniors enrolled in medicares prescription drug program used one or more of the drugs in and paid a total of billion out of pocket the drugs identified tuesday represent the first wave of medicines destined for price negotiation with the roster expanding in future years for this initial batch manufacturers have until the start of october to agree to price negotiation with the centers for medicare and medicaid services if they do the companies will quickly need to disclose an array of data to cms for each selected drug regarding revenue and what the manufacturer spent to research develop and produce it if a manufacturer refuses to negotiate or wont agree to what federal rules call a maximum fair price the company will face a substantial tax or must withdraw from medicare and medicaid the nations largest public health insurance program designed for people with low incomes to be considered for the price negotiation a drug must have no competition from a less expensive generic competitor and a biologic a category of drugs made from living organisms must not compete with any cheaper version known as biosimilars the number of drugs involved will expand slightly during the next two years with a total of each of the next two years and drugs in following years this year and next the drugs are part of medicares part d the programs drug insurance created two decades ago after that the drugs can come from part d or from part b such as cancer therapies which are administered by doctors senior health administration officials briefing reporters early tuesday and speaking on the condition of anonymity before a speech by the president said cms started with nearly prescription drugs that are covered through part d they then whittled the possibilities to that dont have much competition and that result in the highest costs to medicare including drugs that were approved by the food and drug administration at least seven years ago and biologics approved at least years ago a few other criteria were used too from there cms ranked the choosing the with the highest costs to the program limited though it is the arrival of medicare drug price negotiation is a sharp break from medicares history when the program was created in the s it covered drugs that were administered in a doctors office part b but excluded medications that patients took on their own despite efforts over the decades to add outpatient drug benefits they were woven into larger health reform proposals that failed and the broader drug benefits did not become part of the program until a set of medicare changes adopted by congress in to win republican support that statute included language that prohibited any role for the government to negotiate medication prices the inflation reduction act known as ira rescinded the prohibition since the outpatient drug benefits embedded in the law began three years later medicare beneficiaries have been able to get that coverage by buying a separate drug plan through part d or as part of managed care plans known as medicare advantage either way beneficiaries still pay some of the cost of getting the medicines and the government has not influenced the prices that pharmaceutical companies set the push for price negotiation faced intense opposition from pharmaceutical companies which contend that capping potential earning erodes their ability to invest in further research and development after a rare loss on capitol hill the industry and its business allies have turned to the courts with the eight cases that could take years to resolve and could land before the supreme court if the negotiation process stands industry analysts predict it will have profound ripple effect prices negotiated and made public by medicare could affect negotiations between commercial insurers and drugmakers in turn pharmaceutical companies could focus on developing larger molecule drugs such as vaccines and gene therapies that are exempted from potential medicare price negotiations for a longer period than prescription pills the ultimate impacts of the law are hard to predict even companies critical of it acknowledge they could benefit from provisions that make their medications more affordable to patients the ira law is not all gloom and doom for biopharma since it will reduce seniors out of pocket costs motivating patients to stay on them longer according to analysts at leerink partners a health care focused investment bank and some drugs designated for negotiation at first might not remain on the list for long because they are scheduled to lose their patent protection soon after the lower prices take effect meaning they would have competition and no longer be eligible for the negotiated prices for the biden administration the inflation reduction act provision is a centerpiece of a battle to curb drug prices that it is waging on several fronts under the law medicare beneficiaries pay a limit of a month for insulin biden issued an executive order last year directing the department of health and human services to study new models to lower drug costs for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries in may hhs proposed a rule that would give the department and states more leverage to negotiate payment for the most expensive drugs covered by medicaid and the federal trade commission has taken a more aggressive approach to pharmaceutical mergers citing concerns about price increases when it filed suit in may to block amgen from acquiring horizon therapeutics even though the two companies dont directly compete because the impact of the medicare drug price provision will unfold over years the negotiated prices may have a minimal effect on some drugs including eliquis a blood thinning medication that cost medicare billion in by far the most of any drug eliquis made by bristol myers squibb and pfizer is set to lose patent protection in the year that medicares negotiated prices first takes effect whatever the impact is will not be long lasting on our portfolio angela hwang pfizers chief commercial officer said of eliquis in a call with financial analysts this month according to a transcript compiled by s p global market intelligence johnson johnson with three drugs on the list the most of any drugmaker was less conciliatory the iras policies put an artificial deadline on innovation threatening intellectual property protections and shortening the timeframe to deepen our understanding of patients unmet medical needs the company said in a statement tuesday bristol myers squibb said in a statement tuesday that eliquis was targeted for this program due to the sheer number of medicare patients who benefit from the medicine not its price what our post debate poll means for desantis ramaswamy and haley analysis by aaron blake from left former vice president mike pence florida gov ron desantis and former south carolina governor nikki haley right listen as vivek ramaswamy speaks during wednesday nights republican presidential debate joshua lott the washington post twenty nine percent of republican primary voters who watched wednesdays debate said that florida gov ron desantis won while percent said the same of businessman vivek ramaswamy according to a new poll from the washington post fivethirtyeight and ipsos former south carolina governor nikki haley came in third at percent desantiss political operation responded as expected by hyping its candidate as the winner ramaswamys share also suggests he will be a force in the presidential primary race ahead but in context their showings are a bit less impressive and the actual impact on the race is probably larger for haley the first thing to remember is that polling on debates often reflects peoples preconceived notions about the candidates you already like desantis youre predisposed to believe your guy won thats perhaps less the case in primary debates where polarization isnt as large a factor but the rule still applies donald trump is the clear front runner ahead of the primaries but he didnt participate in the debate desantis is pulling more than one third of the non trump vote in the fivethirtyeight national polling average ramaswamy about one quarter this means that desantis draws a larger percentage of the non trump vote in the national polling average than he did among debate watchers who deemed him the victor ramaswamys numbers are about the same for both metrics if theres one candidate who overperformed by this measure its haley shes taking only about percent of the non trump vote in the national polling average but nearly double that number say she won the debate so who are the people who say these candidates won and did the candidates expand their appeal those might be the more interesting questions for desantis the group saying he won was largely made up of people who already said they were considering him at percent just percent of people who had not previously considered desantis said he won ramaswamy and haley impressed more voters for whom they hadnt been on the radar ramaswamy was deemed the winner by percent of those not previously considering him while haley took percent among those who hadnt considered her before wednesday night thats likely in part because voters were less familiar with ramaswamy and haley but it suggests that those candidates might be expanding their appeal more than desantis is ramaswamys showing also comes with some sizable asterisks while he clearly appealed to many watchers he also polarized people his favorable rating increased among debate watchers by points from percent before to percent after his unfavorable rating increased by points from percent before to percent after as for who those voters were ramaswamys favorable and unfavorable increases were largely across the board but there were some differences one of his biggest unfavorable increases came among women while his favorable rating rose by percent among them his unfavorable rating rose by points ramaswamy who has made a point to defend trump and has offered a trumpian vision for the country also seemed to turn off trump skeptics in the gop among those not considering voting for trump his favorable rating stayed the same but his unfavorable rating jumped by points haleys numbers might be the most significant and not just because she overperformed her standing in the polls the data suggest the former united nations ambassador who tried to give her party some tough love on wednesday night won the battle over the trump skeptics in the party haley was the winner according to just percent of those who said they were considering voting for trump but percent of those who werent considering trump in the latter trump skeptic demographic she significantly outpaced two others with a potential claim to those voters former new jersey governor chris christie percent and former vice president mike pence percent haleys favorable ratings increased by double digits basically across the board but her biggest increases were with women percent those who rely more on the mainstream media than fox news and conservative media percent nonconservatives percent and those not considering trump percent so in the end haley probably expanded her appeal the most but she did so among a section of the party that isnt particularly large the challenge for her would be solidifying herself as the candidate of that wing of the party while still maintaining some appeal to the trump contingent which neither christie nor pence has managed to do ramaswamy meanwhile apparently cost himself a broader base of appeal with his very forceful debate performance but his path to relevance is clearly through the populist trumpian wing of the party and he likely did himself some good there we might expect both to rise in the polls more than desantis but we shouldnt really expect the race to be significantly recast in large part because all of these candidates are battling for the less than percent of voters who arent already on the trump train emily guskin contributed to this report

collapse of the uks air traffic control system with five flights scheduled to bring customers back to gatwick airport as airlines estimated the failure could cost them up to m airlines are facing costs in the tens of millions according to willie walsh the former chief executive of british airways who is now the director general of theinternational air transport association as disruption extended into the third day i would imagine at an industry level well be getting close to m of additional costs that airlines have encountered as a result of this failure walsh told the bbc although he cautioned it was too early to determine the eventual cost the chief executive of the air traffic control service nats formerly national air traffic services martin rolfe confirmed the chaos was caused when part of the system collapsed on monday because it didnt recognise a message rolfes comments appear to confirm claims by unnamed sources reported by the independent on tuesday that the failure was triggered when a french airline submitted a dodgy flight plan the system could not process walsh said the outage led to the cancellation of about flights to and from four uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and manchester on monday affecting the journeys of hundreds of thousands of passengers he said nats had questions to answer adding it was staggering that a single piece of data could have been at fault the airlines are not hopeful that they will be able to recoup any of their costs from nats according to walsh this is what really frustrates and angers airlines this was completely outside the control of the airlines and yet airlines are subject to paying customers for delays for cancellations for looking after them which is very considerable he said its very unfair because the air traffic control system which was at the heart of this failure doesnt pay a single penny rolfe apologised to affected passengers and said the company did not underestimate the impact of the outage we worked absolutely as quickly as we could to make sure we could safely restore the service rolfe told bbc radio s today programme almost all the time it handles it absolutely perfectly in fact this is staggering in the sense that it is incredibly rare and we make it our business to make sure it is incredibly rare asked why the flight data that caused widespread cancellations was not rejected like a piece of spam rolfe said our systems are safety critical systems they are dealing with the lives of passengers and the travelling public so even things like just throwing data away

early this would not be surprising many of the military coups in recent years have been greeted by enthusiastic public celebrations some have been organised for the media to win swift legitimacy but many have been spontaneous outbursts of excitement at the simple prospect of change few doubt gabon needed a shake up the president inherited power from his father who ruled from until his death in

volumes about the decades of mismanagement clientelism corruption and blatant political rigging that the bongo dynasty brought the exact motivation for the takeover will soon become clear it is unlikely to be the protection of gabons institutions from security or other threats as the new apparent rulers claimed in their first address the lack of concerted regional african or global response to the other recent coups is likely to have been a major factor in the soldiers decision to gamble their lives and livelihoods on a grab for power this failure has been more obvious than ever in

the case of gabon the military can count on popular support and that of the opposition a recent united nations development programme survey of thousands of people living in countries where coups had recently occurred found strong democratic aspirations this is true elsewhere too and is being reinforced as africa becomes more urban and educated but above all there is a desire for change as soon as possible even if this means it comes wearing combat fatigues there is a wider trend to watch as well many of the recent coups are in former french colonies and one cause is undoubtedly the revived memory of long exploitative rule from paris africa watchers have long worried about the inherent instability of the system left by france after it ended its direct colonial control across a swath of the continent this toxic mix of political manipulation financial control military intervention extractive commercial enterprise and cosy relations between elites is far from unique to francophone africa but is very entrenched there even today gabon too was a french colony as recalled by emmanuel macron when he met the french educated bongo in paris in late june the photos of the two presidents shaking hands may not have done either much good every coup is different but many outcomes resemble one another the new leaders of gabon will almost certainly follow the same path as their counterparts farther north and announce a transition period before new elections which will not be held for a long time in the meantime tearful pleas by bongo from his official residence to which he is now confined for supporters to make some noise are likely to fall on deaf ears top books about solitary living finding your way without the social template of romantic love is a tough challenge but writers from deborah levy to hanya yanagihara offer clues to how it can be done for most of us the idea of romantic love has lost hardly any of its allure it continues to be the focus of our collective fantasies it is perhaps the most essential component of what most people understand happiness to be but more people live alone now than at any other time in history people like me many of us willingly or not have said goodbye to the grand idea of love even if some of us still believe in it but can you really live a good life alone without a romantic relationship how sustainable is a model like that and how do you learn to live with being alone without it hurting without lying to yourself these were the questions that i didnt know the answers to when i started writing my book alone but i knew that i needed to find them some of the answers i found in literature in a wide array of essays and novels it turned out this is a small selection the cost of living by deborah levy many people find themselves in relationships that make them unhappy but are unable to end them because theyre afraid of being and staying alone its a fear that our culture deeply instils in all of us partly because there are too few books like this one the cost of living the second instalment of levys living autobiography series deals with what happens when life falls apart and we do not want to mend it any more its a book about what comes after marriage about breaking out of the societal roles all of us have internalised about wanting everything from life and the harsh but worthwhile price we pay for it bluets by maggie nelson whenever one of your friends is lovesick give them a copy of bluets its an essay of melancholy genius purportedly a meditation on the colour blue it examines the pains of pining for someone and in the end the subsiding of these pains nelson tries to find dignity in loneliness but fails arriving instead at embracing solitude as a way of relating to and fully seeing the world the essay is a marvel to read again and again ti amo by hanne rstavik there are times in life we all encounter crushing loneliness regardless of how many friends we have and whether were in a romantic relationship or not one of these times comes when somebody we love dies in her autofictional novella norwegian writer rstavik tries to come to terms with the loneliness of anticipatory grief she has moved to milan to be with the man she loves only to find out he has cancer and less than a year to live ti amo chronicles the daily life of someone who cant talk about whats going on inside her to anyone its a gripping book and impossible to forget the lonely city by olivia laing for anyone who wants to read and think about loneliness this is the holy grail olivia laing is such a masterful writer her reflections on the psychology and psychoanalysis of loneliness are as deft as they are enlightening and her shedding light on the art and lives of queer artists such as klaus nomi peter hujar and david wojnarowicz who at some point were almost forgotten is a joy throughout her essays laing makes clear that even though loneliness is debilitating and makes us feel unlike ourselves its very human too a little life by hanya yanagihara i personally feel that hanya yanagihara is our tolstoy in a way all three of her novels deal with people going through their lives alone this theme is most pronounced in a little life yanagihara rigorously examines how it is possible to lead a life shaped by trauma and whether an almost perfect adopted family can change the daily encounters with the psychological and bodily consequences of that trauma its a novel of an intensity beyond compare look at me by anita brookner im not sure which of anita brookners novels i love most they all are gorgeously written and deal with being single in a way that no novels have before or since brookner trains unflinching attention on the emotional vicissitudes of life in a society that gives single people the feeling they really are terrible failures despite its dry humour look at me is a book that can break your heart brookner makes her readers feel well mannered librarian fannys slow burning devastation acutely she leaves us breathless and a little devastated ourselves accident a days news by christa wolf wolf is the german writer i love most in this autofictional novel from she chronicles a day she spends by herself in a little house in the east german countryside trying to make sense of two competing events in her life the risky brain surgery her brother undergoes that day and the nuclear meltdown in cernobyl a few days before its a difficult book at times because wolf is grappling with something that our psyches usually dont allow us to see how helpless we are in the face of fateful events beyond our control and how catastrophically we are thrown into history accident is so inspiring because wolf knows that we have to deal with that fact alone and gives us a hard won example of how to do just that assembly by natasha brown there are different kinds of solitude and also different kinds of loneliness one of them is what the philosopher jill stauffer calls ethical loneliness its the feeling of being abandoned by the society we live in and being confronted with its unacknowledged injustices and cruelties browns minimalist novel quietly dissects what this kind of loneliness does to us it unhurriedly evokes our long history of oppression and shows the effects it has on the assembling of our identities its a haunting book that culminates in a decision you cant get out of your head the years by annie ernaux i know ernauxs masterpiece is not strictly a book about aloneness but its rich and multi faceted tapestry can teach us more about our solitary lives than most of the books i know the years is a meditation on the events of the french writers private life and the changing attitudes of the society during her lifetime uncompromisingly yet poetically she chronicles how a society produces loneliness by excluding people because of their sex gender identity or marriage status its hard to overstate how brilliant this book is im not able to do it justice if you havent read it already start now the vaster wilds by lauren groff due out next month this novel follows an unnamed girl who flees from a colonial settlement in s virginia to make her way through the forests and rivers of north america groff turns the ideological underpinnings of classic robinsonades deftly on their head during her fight for survival the girl comes to an understanding of the natural world and her life within it which is a rare testament to the spiritual upsides of loneliness that we can only experience when we are alone alone by daniel schreiber is

quoted by the associated press earlier this year netflix streamers expansion into gaming is natural extension the queens gambit game is a chess simulator based on the adventures of the series main character beth harmon think of netflix and a memorable television show or movie will likely pop into your mind what did you most enjoy squid game bridgerton stranger things maybe soon the streaming service wants video games to be competing for a place on that list netflix says games are a key part of its proposition to stay relevant with audiences in years to come and is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers leanne loombe vice president of external games at netflix tells bbc news games are one of the biggest forms of entertainment out there today so it really is just a natural extension for netflix to include them as part of the subscription the lines between the different ways we enjoy our entertainment are blurring when youre in that moment looking to sit and watch a movie or be more active and play a game we want to make sure we have something for you our goal is to have a game on the service for everyone not focus on making one big experience but rather a selection of titles that members can choose to play since november games have been available to play on the netflix app but this development passed many users by loombe says the streaming service has deliberately not been shouting from the rooftops but instead taking their time to understand the market place first so far whats being offered are mobile games with some tied to famous netflix franchises like stranger things and others independent of the service like reigns three kingdoms currently theyre only available to play on mobile devices although tests are under way to see how they could work on tvs and computers this low key approach is a sensible move according to games journalist shay thompson who explains the industry is littered with the failed attempts from legacy media brands to get into the world of gaming when other mainstream entertainment organisations have tried to enter the game space theyve really struggled thompson says i think its often down to companies fundamentally misunderstanding what it is about games as a form of entertainment that make them so compelling to players amazon games is an example of this theyve had titles like lost ark and and crucible with big budgets but those titles lacked the creativity and uniqueness that weve come to expect from the games space thats a significant reason why those titles havent ended up making a serious impact experiences such as this and tech giant google who closed its stadia console this year show how difficult it is to find a place in the games space for companies amazons games division may not yet be as successful as its prime video operation however we still expect to see more titles from them in future the company is currently working on a the next iteration of the tomb raider franchise starring lara croft focusing on the mobile games first is a clever strategy that could work in netflix favour says thompson it looks as if theyre talking the time to understand the landscape and gamers i know their reputation has been a bit shaky on the streaming side recently but it certainly seems like theyre trying to work with the games space and not against it however giving gamers what they want not what a big organisations think they want will be the key to making this work that is creativity and being unique amazon have been making games like multiplayer experience new world since in future loombe says we can expect to see netflix leverage its intellectual property even more connecting shows movies and games together from our universes is what were trying to accomplish she explains in a trendy office space in central liverpool thats exactly what the team at ripstone studios are trying to do in amongst the exposed brick succulent plants and pop culture memorabilia littered on the desks are developers and programmers busy creating the next update for their first partnership with netflix the queens gambit is as you may have guessed a chess simulator based on the adventures of the television series main character beth harmon the team won the contract to make the game after jaime brayshaw the creative executive sent netflix an email out of the blue i asked them when will netflix become the netflix of games he laughs ripstone who have a long history of making chess games became one of the first companies to partner with the streaming giant to work on their games offering brayshaw says the relationship is not just a licensing agreement but rather a collaborative partnership with both companies sharing expertise with each other as well as offering more content to netflix customers in an increasingly competitive market brayshaw thinks their collaboration is a chance to help grow gaming as a form of entertainment as well netflix has an audience million people now he says many of them will never have played a game before so we had to think about designing one that is accessible to as many people as possible even if theyve never played a video game its exciting because it potentially allows more people to experience the joys of playing games and it could broaden the popularity of the medium netflix started offering games such as stranger things the game to subscribers in confident that this agreement is a win win brayshaw isnt worried about joining the long history of failed game and movie or television tie ins yes there are lots of bad examples from yesteryear with tie ins that are bad but its usually because there are timelines involved he argues netflix has a more mature approach where the products dont have to tie together at release so fewer compromises are needed the streamer will be keen to learn from the other big media organisations renowned for working in film television or tech whove tried to cross the divide into the games space googles cloud gaming service stadia was discontinued in january while amazons games division has developed its own titles with mixed success it is currently working on a new lara croft game but none of its releases so far have challenged the popularity of titles like fortnite or call of duty there were redundancies at the studio earlier this year by focusing on mobile titles which are cheaper to make than big console releases there is less financial risk for netflix it isnt investing millions in one experience that has to compete with well established brands to be deemed a success should a project fail to reach lots of players the financial ramifications are not as significant the queens gambit is the latest example of netflix leveraging its intellectual property in the gaming space however the other side of the coin is that in such a competitive space if players are not impressed with what theyre seeing if they feel it lacks scope or ambition they will very quickly move on to something else it can be difficult to regain an audience that has moved on to other games this bottom up approach is different to what weve seen before and we wont be able to judge its success for some time as loombe reiterates were very early in our games journey right now when its such a big industry like games and theres already some fantastic titles out there in the market that players really love we just want to make sure we were doing things in the right way nagorno karabakh people are fainting queuing up for bread nagorno karabakh conflict demonstrators rally to demand the reopening of a blockaded road linking the nagorno karabakh region to armenia in stepanakert july demonstrations have been taking place in nagorno karabakhs regional capital stepanakert demanding the reopening of a blockaded road linking the region to armenia by rayhan demytrie bbc south caucasus correspondent armenian border they call it the road of life as it is the only route connecting ethnic armenians living in azerbaijans nagorno karabakh region with the republic of armenia but for nearly nine months the lachin corridor has been blocked by azerbaijani authorities resulting in severe shortages of food medication hygiene products and fuel in the breakaway region eighteen year old hayk is standing on the balcony of a modest hotel in goris on the armenian side of the border with azerbaijan speaking to his mother on a video call no eggs no sugar there are no sweets at all bread is being rationed got up at the other day to stand in the queue says his mother speaking from the karabakh town of martakert hayk is not his real name i have changed it for his own safety armenians are unable to reach their families on the other side of the lachin corridor because it has been blocked by azerbaijan since december no independent media have been able to reach the nagorno karabakh enclave photos and videos of empty shops have been circulating on social media professional headshot of irina hayrapetyanirina hayrapetyan people have to walk many kilometres by foot to stand in queues to buy whatever they can to feed their

since march no fuel no medication not even shampoo and regular power cuts with winter coming it will get worse her son feels hatred fear and despair because i understand sooner or later my home my city my country will be taken by azerbaijan long line of trucks stuck at the entrance to the lachin corridor lorries with tonnes of humanitarian aid for karabakh including food medicine baby formula and other essentials are parked in front of the azerbaijani checkpoint for karabakh armenians their home is artsakh a self declared republic that does not exist on the world map as this mountainous enclave is part of azerbaijans nagorno karabakh region despite having so much in common culturally the two south caucasus states of armenia and azerbaijan have fought for control of this land for decades in wars that have cost tens of thousands of lives in the most recent six week war in azerbaijan recaptured all the territories surrounding nagorno karabakh held by armenia since a ceasefire brokered by russia relied on the deployment of russian peacekeepers to guarantee the safety of ethnic armenians and to control the lachin corridor allowing for the free movement of people and goods between karabakh and the republic of armenia but with russias focus on the war in ukraine azerbaijan blocked the road to nagorno karabakhs regional capital stepanakert known in azerbaijan as khandendi with government backed environmental activists last december a map shows the location of the lachin corridor and the armenia azerbaijan border px transparent line in april azerbaijan installed its own military checkpoint at the entrance to the lachin corridor justifying its sovereign right and full restoration of its territorial integrity it accused armenia of using the road to bring in military supplies which armenia denies the only international humanitarian organisations with access to nagorno karabakh are the international committee of the red cross icrc and the mine clearance organisation the halo trust the halo trust says it has been unable to deploy demining teams in recent weeks because its staff are too exhausted to work after queuing for bread all night and returning home empty handed it says halting operations in martakert is particularly unfortunate as it has become a hub for people displaced by the war in and they are now at risk of injury as well as malnutrition although the red cross has been carrying out medical evacuations it has not been able to guarantee safe passage as the khachatryan family found out on july that was the day year old vagif khachatryan was being transported to armenias capital yerevan for urgent surgery for a heart condition when they approached the azerbaijani checkpoint they said they needed to take him for minutes to ask him a few questions says his daughter vera khachatryan my father was taken away with a red cross employee a few minutes later the red cross employee returned but my father was taken in an unknown direction originally from karabakh she moved to the armenian town of jermuk after her village was returned to azerbaijan as part of the ceasefire agreement now every minute every second i am thinking what if his heart stops vera khachatryan sits on a bench by st gayane church in jermuk armenia image caption vera khachatryan fears for her fathers health after he was taken by the azerbaijani authorities on his way to armenia for heart surgery azerbaijans authorities have accused her father of war crimes committed during the first karabakh war in there are a lot of eyewitnesses who recognise him through media reports we never said war criminals shouldnt face justice says hikmet hajiyev special adviser to azerbaijans president ilham aliyev vera says the accusations are untrue defending your country is not a crime there cannot be a fair trial in azerbaijan maybe there will be justice one day but we dont have the time to wait for it vagif khachatryans case has sent a shock wave among men in nagorno karabakh three young karabakh armenian football players were detained this week at the same checkpoint for desecrating the azerbaijani flag in the fear now is that any ethnic armenian male could face the same fate if they try to cross veras two other sisters remain in karabakh under blockade my sisters granddaughter is two months old there is no baby formula her mother does not have enough milk as she is not eating properly there is no medicine for my year old nephew who was brain damaged during the war he lost his ability to speak and his right arm does not move this month the us called on azerbaijan to restore free movement along the lachin corridor during an emergency un security council meeting on the crisis the international court of justice had already told azerbaijan it had a legally binding order to allow unimpeded movement of persons vehicles and cargo on the road in both directions but armenians are sceptical of the international communitys commitment to resolve the crisis protesters in yerevan have blocked the entrance to the un office with food and sacks of flour to demand the roads reopening soldiers stand by boxes filled with sunflower oil outside un offices in yerevan boxes of food items including sunflower oil pile up outside the un offices in yerevan azerbaijan denies a humanitarian crisis is unfolding it says it wants full control of the territory and has offered an alternative supply route via the town of agdam retaken during the war then afterwards the lachin road will be opened in hours as well more roads are better for everybody says the azerbaijani presidents special adviser hikmet hajiyev says karabakh armenians have been offered the same linguistic cultural religious including municipal rights as azerbaijani citizens but armenias ambassador at large edmon marukyan accuses azerbaijan of making false promises when there is only one route connecting armenia to nagorno karabakh they want to try and change the focus of the international community to dissolve the understanding and obligation of the lachin corridor former un special rapporteur gulnara shahinian warns that severing the last link with the republic of armenia will spell annihilation for karabakh armenians you know what level of human rights violations occur in azerbaijan with their entire hatred policy how could you expect that there would be a good attitude towards armenians in karabakh a short drive from goris a mountain panorama offers a clear view of the current crisis on the armenian side nothing moves along a new road built to circumvent territory returned to azerbaijan as part of the ceasefire agreement a line of lorries loaded with tonnes of humanitarian aid for karabakh including food medicine baby formula and

of migrant families streamed across the u s mexico border in august according to preliminary data obtained by the washington post an influx that has upended biden administration efforts to discourage parents from entering illegally with children and could once again place immigration in the spotlight during a presidential race sign up for fact checker our weekly review of whats true false or in between in politics the u s border patrol arrested at least migrants who crossed as part of a family group in august exceeding the prior one month record of set in may during the trump administration families were the single largest demographic group crossing the border in august surpassing single adults for the first time since biden took office overall the data show border apprehensions have risen more than percent for two consecutive months after falling sharply in may and june as the biden administration rolled out new restrictions and entry opportunities the border patrol made more than arrests along the mexico border in august up from in july and in june erin heeter a spokesperson for the department of homeland security said the biden administration is trying to slow illegal entries by expanding lawful options and also stiffening penalties the government ramped up deportation flights carrying families in august she said and since may has repatriated more than parents and children who recently crossed the border in a family group but as with every year the u s is seeing ebbs and flows of migrants arriving fueled by seasonal trends and the efforts of smugglers to use disinformation to prey on vulnerable migrants and encourage migration heeter said in a statement family groups have been an achilles heel for u s immigration enforcement for over a decade most migrants in that category who are detained by border patrol agents are quickly released and allowed to live and work in the united states while their humanitarian claims are pending backlogged u s immigration courts typically take several years to reach a decision and the process rarely ends in deportation federal data show coming amid peak summer heat the latest surge underscores the extent to which u s immigration enforcement has come full circle since trumps tenure when the department of homeland security faced an influx of families crossing from mexico and for several months tried taking children from their parents as a deterrent trump officials eventually reduced family crossings by aggressively expanding the remain in mexico program which sent thousands of asylum seekers back across the border to wait many in squalid conditions while their claims were adjudicated in u s courts when the pandemic hit in early trump used a provision of title the u s public health code to rapidly expel border crossers to their home countries or mexico without a chance to seek asylum u s customs and border protection carried out million expulsions including of families between march and may records show president biden who ran for office pledging more humane treatment for migrants halted remain in mexico and closed the three detention centers for families operated by u s immigration and customs enforcement biden has replaced the pandemic policy with new measures that allow tens of thousands more migrants to come to the united states legally each month but make it harder for those who cross illegally to get released after making an asylum claim the latest customs and border protection data show more than migrants were processed in august at u s border crossings where the biden administration is allowing up to per day to schedule an appointment to enter the country lawfully using a mobile app that increased the total number of migrants encountered by cbp at the southern

states instead of crossing at the border both programs are facing challenges in federal court from officials in republican led states illegal crossings by migrants from the parole eligible countries have fallen sharply but cbp records show major increases this summer in migration from guatemala honduras ecuador peru and an array of nations in asia and africa the arrival of thousands of parents with children in remote areas amid triple digit temperatures is a major humanitarian linguistic and logistical challenge the biden administration has expanded the border agencys network of climate

grim detention cells with concrete benches and were designed as short term holding facilities for adults blas nu ez neto the biden administrations top border policy official said in a federal court filing last week that bipartisan efforts to control the border helped reduce illegal crossings from more than million a year decades ago to fewer than a year on average from to but partisan gridlock has intensified and the demographic makeup of migrants has changed officials saw a marked increase in families and unaccompanied minors arriving at the southern border some have been targeted by violence in their home countries that could make them eligible for humanitarian programs but others are relying on promises from smugglers who tell them families are far less likely to be deported the august tally brings the total number of family member units surrendering at the southern border during the current fiscal year to more than half a million people a record with one more month to count the biden administration has sent mixed messages about targeting families for deportation during his first year in office biden pledged to reunite the families trump had separated and to protect undocumented families already living inside the united states in biden administration officials ended family immigration detention and declared schools and places where children gather off limits for immigration enforcement officials said they would not detain or deport women who are pregnant or breastfeeding but officials said they would continue to deport families who had recently crossed the border worried that if they didnt their numbers would overwhelm border patrol facilities in recent months biden administration officials have held news conferences with spanish language media and published footage of deportation flights carrying children to discourage families from attempting to cross border crossings down but many migrants released to u s to avoid crowding the biden administration also has created enforcement programs targeting families in department of homeland security and justice department officials created a dedicated immigration court docket in cities to adjudicate family cases within days of the initial hearing the expedited system which is not for all families is much faster than the usual time for the backlogged immigration courts the program operates in boston denver detroit el paso los angeles miami newark new york san diego san francisco and seattle advocates for immigrants say the system is unfair because thousands of migrants have been unable to find lawyers and it is unclear how families are assigned to the faster docket in may biden officials launched the family expedited removal management program or ferm which places some heads of households under gps monitoring and into the fast track deportation process these families also have mandatory curfews from p m to a m cbs news reported thursday that fewer than family members have been deported from that program ferm is one element of dhss operations to enforce u s immigration law and to remove individuals and families without a legal basis to stay in the country dhss heeter said dhs has removed or returned more than recently arrived migrants since may heeter said a number that includes the who came to the united states as part of a family group in fiscal year immigration and customs enforcement deported more than people who had entered the united states as part of a family group more than double the number from the year before according to a federal report

and aid displaced residents desantis hurricane search and rescue to begin as soon as its safe shareplay video this is part of a tradition florida republicans have a history of supporting government assistance for their states natural disasters while frequently rejecting broader packages designed to lessen the impact of these emergencies torn between their constituents priorities and their partys position on reining in the federal debt desantis vote a decade ago was based on his opposition to the sandy packages additional pork spending a spokesperson for his presidential campaign said thursday florida gop lawmakers in both chambers frequently release similar statements after voting against disaster money citing the countrys sky high deficit as the determining factor but one florida republican calls that position increasingly untenable in a state that so frequently finds itself at ground zero for catastrophic hurricanes just one of the litany of disasters that scientists expect to become worse as the planet warms its always understandable why people in theory would vote against federal aid when it doesnt affect them said carlos curbelo a former miami area gop member of congress but when you live in florida that position is unsustainable desantis probably regrets taking that vote on sandy he added he is now in a position of requesting federal aid for hurricane relief for the second year in a row and these are major asks these are billions upon billions of dollars carlos curbelo its always understandable why people in theory would vote against federal aid when it doesnt affect them said carlos curbelo a former gop member of congress but when you live in florida that position is unsustainable alex wong getty images its been almost years since then new york republican rep peter king dared his gop colleagues to meet their moral obligation to help natural disaster torn communities a plea that house republicans including desantis ultimately rejected but desantis as a republican and a floridian is not unique in his relationship to federal disaster spending the states congressional delegation has a history of idiosyncratic voting patterns on legislation that would seek to respond to or mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events that are direct results of the worsening climate crisis gop senators weigh special meeting on their leadership after mcconnells freeze feinstein is a silent character in her sad and messy final chapter why is nobody doing anything about mitch mcconnell slightly higher times biden administration moves to loosen weed restrictions desantis voted against sandy aid a decade ago now his state needs the help republicans from florida have repeatedly voted to send federal disaster relief to their own state at times vocally pushing for it sen rick scott r fla for instance has said he will demand an immediate vote next week on a bill to refill the federal emergency management agencys coffers i will not allow washington to continue playing games with disaster aid and the lives of those needing our help scott said in a statement more broadly florida republicans in congress have for the last decade largely toed the party line on climate politics refusing to support legislation that could be perceived as hostile to the oil and gas industry while embracing measures that would help their state in more immediate and tangible ways respond to climate change curbelo predicts it will soon become harder for florida republicans to cherry pick what they are willing to accept and sacrifice while florida has always experienced dangerous hurricanes he said it has become especially vulnerable to violent storms sea level rise coastal erosion and heat waves the state is under a lot of stress in terms of insurance issues said curbelo who spent his two terms in congress working to push his party to acknowledge the climate crisis markets are not forgiving they expose risk and weakness with every storm with every major flooding event the pressure on florida members to support a broad climate policy agenda is going to grow lost bipartisan tradition the fight over sandy funding marked a shift in the debate over what responsibility members of congress owe one another when faced with natural disasters as lawmakers were preparing to adjourn the th congress in the first days of january after an extended legislative session to address the fiscal cliff house gop leaders abruptly canceled a vote on sandy aid amid outcry from conservatives who didnt want to spend more government money after king and other republicans revolted and shamed their leadership a vote was convened swiftly upon reconvening for the th congress on jan the relief bill was passed all but three florida republicans voted no on the grounds it spent too much money also desantis argument at that time jeremy redfern a desantis press secretary told politicos e e news that we have no time for politics or pettiness when asked if the governor wishes he had voted differently in as a member of congress desantis supported emergency disaster relief funding for hurricane sandy but he did not support the additional pork spending that ended up in the final relief bill bryan griffin press secretary for desantis presidential campaign added in a separate statement republicans at the time complained that the sandy package continued to fund a depleted national flood insurance program with money the government didnt have as governor griffin said desantis will of course marshal all available resources state and federal to aid those in need during recovery dan weiss a veteran climate advocate observed that sandy was the turning point in what came next for how congressional republicans have since approached disaster relief funding votes it used to be extremely bipartisan like so many other things involving money he said peter king came from the bipartisan tradition of providing disaster relief to states based on need florida republicans have by and large gone on to support sending money to avert weather catastrophes but typically only if their own state was included and only as stand alone propositions not as part of larger spending packages the states house gop delegation for example unanimously supported an billion disaster aid package in december to help florida texas puerto rico the u s virgin islands and california rebuild after a series of natural disasters that year including hurricanes irma harvey and maria but the delegation split in february when that disaster money was folded into a larger government spending bill then president donald trump eventually signed into law at that point five florida republicans in the house voted against the bill while supported it siding with sen marco rubio r fla and then florida democratic sen bill nelson in the other chamber in all but two florida republicans in the house backed legislation that would among other things mitigate the damage done to their state from hurricane michael in the senate rubio and scott who had by then unseated nelson voted yes too then came hurricane ian in congress included language in the bill allowing fema to tap billion to respond to a slew of natural disasters including ian every florida republican in the house voted against it scott opposed it in the senate rubio didnt vote looming political liability florida republicans have rallied around other policies to protect their states specific environmental interests they have continued a time honored tradition of joining with democrats to oppose oil drilling in their states portion of the gulf of mexico an activity some of them argue could hamper activities at nearby military bases and which all of them see as a risk to the peace health and safety of florida communities but theyve also criticized the biden administrations efforts to limit the practice in other states gop members of the florida congressional delegation have also typically supported major federal investments to restore the everglades the largest subtropical wilderness in the united states at the same time they have not fought back against specific development and mining projects in the area that the environmental protection agency and florida conservation groups say could threaten endangered species and fragile ecosystems ultimately said league of conservation voters vice president of political affairs craig auster these positions wont make a difference if congress isnt supporting policies to drive down greenhouse gas emissions were not going to protect florida coastal communities and were not going to protect the everglades if we arent addressing climate change auster said because climate change is the biggest threat to both of those things hurricane idalia a canopy lies wrapped around a tree in an rv park in mayo fla after the passage of hurricane idalia on wednesday rebecca blackwell ap photo there have been some occasions since when florida republicans in congress engaged with democrats on legislation that would have made targeted long lasting contributions to disaster preparedness and resiliency in the house passed the reforming disaster recovery act which would have required that all post disaster rebuilding projects funded by certain federal dollars comply with the newest construction codes which account for the realities of climate change elevating buildings and designing structures to withstand intense winds for instance the measure advanced in a vote with five of the republicans favoring it hailing from the florida delegation but it has since languished after the senate failed to take it up yet in the fall of the obama administration got little gop buy in when it established the task force on climate preparedness and resilience to advise on how the federal government could respond to the needs of communities at the forefront of the climate crisis supporters had hoped republicans would get involved but not a single gop federal or statewide elected official joined not even then new jersey gov chris christie weiss noted even though his state suffered extensive damage due to superstorm sandy auster the league of conservation voters vice president sided with curbelo for florida republicans and desantis its going to become harder to stay on the sidelines its all well and good to say the government shouldnt be fighting climate change until your big insurance companies are going to stop providing insurance for unsafe places and if people cant get help when their homes are destroyed and when people are losing their lives to wildfires and floods and hurricanes auster said reporters ariel wittenberg and robin bravender contributed to this report hamlet prince of

so frownd he once when in an angry parle parley he smote the sledded polacks on the ice smote ice struck his poleax long handled battle axe on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour jump hour at this very same hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch martial stalk the walk of a warrior in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion in opinion overall i think this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me why this inform me why are we keeping this nightly watch up here on the castle why are our artisans hard at work every day making cannons why is our country so busy buying weapons of war and why are we hiring so many men to build ships why is everyone working in such a sweat day and night who can tell me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king king hamlet whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride prickd pride goaded on by a most ambitious pride dard to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seizd of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent reasonable portion was gaged pledged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes sharkd resolutes recruited hoodlums for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsative those foresaid lands terms compulsative terms forced on elsinore so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and romage heightened activity in the land i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure the ghost comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote speck it is to trouble the minds eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere before the mightiest julius julius caesar fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star moon upon whose influence neptunes empire stands upon stands the seas make up the empire of neptune the god of the sea in roman mythology the ebb and flow of the tides depend on the gravitational pull of the moon was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding

the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew crowed and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies runs off to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation proof it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning rooster singeth all night long and then they say no spirit can walk abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastern hill

held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raisd a sigh so piteous and profound that it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the

tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work i would fain round to work i would willingly prove so but what would you think when i saw their relationship developing if i had helped them by leaving love letters on a desk or placing them between the pages of a book left on a table what would you think if stood idly by without taking action the fact is i did take action i went to work against allowing this relationship to continue and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time id fain happily gladly know that that i have positively said tis so when it provd otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise pointing to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre center of the earth how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time ill loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras curtain tapestry then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fallen thereon let me be no

rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging oozing thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak

backward aside though this be madness yet there is method in t end of aside will you walk out of the air my lord though method in t though he is mad there is an intelligent design in his actions into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant clever meaningful sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter end of aside my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me

grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmarks a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst ros we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we to

why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure appeal to you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy agreeableness of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love

love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult shed no feather i have of late but wherefore why i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament sky this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence perfection of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted passed them on the

are they even those you were wont to take delight in tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways their ways they were more popular and made more money when in residence in a city i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation i think innovation i think they were prohibited after a recent riot do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted desired pace but there is

they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession if they succession if they continue to act after they become adults they will no longer be a novelty faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre goad them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for the argument plot of a play unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is it possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too hercules too the image of the mythological hero hercules

loved passing well aside still on my daughter hamlets reference to jephthahs daughter leads polonius to conclude that hamlet is thinking about ophelia am i not i the right old jephthah if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well nay that follows not what follows then my lord why as by lot god wot knew and then you know it came to pass as most like it was the first row of the pious chanson pious poem or song will show you more for look where my abridgment comes abridgement this word may mean entertainment it may also mean that the players abridge that is cut off or shorten hamlets conversation with polonius enter four or five players you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend thy face is valanced bearded since i saw thee last comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by r lady by the blessed virgin mary your ladyship boy who plays womens parts is nearer heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine shoe with a thick sole pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold gold coin be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome well een to t take to it like french falconers fly at anything we see well have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my good lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above more than once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviar to the general the general public did not appreciate caviar but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets salads or delicious treats in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arm black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse trojan horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules red horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bakd and impasted encrusted with the residue of the burning city of troy with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus oer sized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles red gems the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon soon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matchd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium troy seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack clouds stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forgd for proof impenetrability eterne eternal with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies parts of a rim from her wheel and bowl the round nave wheel hub down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends this is too long it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee i pray you say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry dirty story or he sleeps becomes bored say on come to hecuba first but who o who had seen the mobled wrapped up enshrouded queen the mobled queen thats good mobled queen is good first run barefoot up and down threatning the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head bisson rheum blinding bisson discharge rheum from the eyes caused by smoke where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all oer teemed loins loins overtaxed or worn out by bearing children a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd gainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncd who pronouncd anyone who had seen hecuba in this sorry state would have condemned lady fortune for her cruelty but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch teary the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look wher whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in s eyes prithee no more tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert gods bodikins by the body of the lord man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends well hear a play to morrow exit polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord well ha t to morrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in t could you not first ay my lord very well follow that lord and look you mock him not exit first player to rosencrantz and guildenstern my good friends ill leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern ay so god be wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion imagination could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wannd could force wannd could force his soul to make his face appear pale tears in his eyes distraction wild excitement in his aspect the way he looks a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave pierce the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak muddy peak man of dubious courage and character who broods like john a dreams sluggish good for nothing unpregnant of my cause not full of desire to avenge my fathers death and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damnd defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate head across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this gives me lungs calls me a liar with all the force his voice can muster ha swounds by his wounds that is the wounds of christ i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon liverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere before this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain but i villain but i lack the boldness to go after claudius after all by this time i should have fed his guts offal to kites birds of prey what a bloody bawdy villain is he remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion lowly kitchen servant fie upon t foh exclamation of disgust about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions sins misdeeds for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent probe him to the quick raw flesh beneath the skin if he but blench flinch i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me ill have grounds more relative than this the plays the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king exit act scene a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance clue hint get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward eager to be sounded questioned but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition forcing disposition forcing himself to be polite and pleasant niggard stingy spare of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime assay to ask him about madam it so fell out that certain players we oer raught overtook on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclind good lemen gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront confront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials concerned observers will so bestow hide ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behavd if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for you ophelia i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted desired normal way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much provd that with devotions visage pious appearance and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word the harlots word the prostitutes cheek plastered with makeup is no more ugly than my devious actions and false words o heavy burden i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to be or not wishd to go on living or end my life that is the question is it nobler to suffer the pain of misfortune or to take action against this pain death brings eternal sleep which supposedly ends suffering that is an outcome to be wished for to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub obstacle problem for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of disprizd love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of to sleep not of the dreams we might have in the sleep of death in fact all that happens in the afterlife is a very intimidating subject for this reason people generally choose to live on rather than ending their lives in spite of the severity of the troubles they face i dont think any person would bear lifes problems scorn oppression insolence love gone wrong injustice the arrogance of the high and mighty rejection if he could end his life without fear of what would happen next in the afterlife but the afterlife is an undiscovered country from whose boundaries no one returns so rather than commit suicide and confront the unknown we choose to stay alive and bear our burdens thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons prayers be all my sins rememberd good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught anything my honourd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composd as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest chaste my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty chastity from what it is to a bawd prostitute whore than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love thee once for the power likeness beautiful women tend to give in to lust rather than remain chaste indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not virtue it we may admire virtue but we ourselves are anything but virtuous i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent somewhat honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between heaven and earth we are arrant complete knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters fools cuckolds you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell o heavenly powers restore him i have heard of your paintings applications of makeup to her face too well enough god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig dance suggestively you amble and you lisp speak affectedly speak in a way designed to impress others and nickname gods creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to ill no more on t it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go exit nickname ignorance you give lewd names to gods creatures but pretend you dont know what they mean o what a noble mind is here oerthrown the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword he has been an example for courtiers soldiers and scholars to imitate the expectancy hope and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observd of all observers quite quite down and i of ladies most deject and wretched that suckd the honey of his music vows sweet words now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatchd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see re enter king and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood sits on a scheme or plot as a hen sits on eggs and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute he shall tribute i will send him to england on the pretense that he is to collect money owed to denmark haply perhaps the seas and countries different with variable objects sights shall expel this something settled matter in his heart the malady that has settled in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t puts him of himself makes him act abnormally it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his griefs let her be round with him and ill be placd so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not and ill conference and i will hide then eavesdrop on their conversation to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go exeunt act scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand do not overdo your gestures thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings actor in a powdered wig who shouts his lines to the uneducated commoners who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oer doing termagant noisy overbearing shrewish woman it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant promise your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reformed that indifferently moderately with us o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work and the queen too and that presently bid the players make haste exit polonius will you two help to hasten them and we will my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern what ho horatio enter horatio here sweet lord at your service horatio thou art een as just a man as eer my conversation copd encountered dealt with withal o my dear lord nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee why should the poor be flatterd no let the candied tongue flatterer lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee bend the knee where thrift may follow fawning dost thou hear where fawning whenever a gain follows his flattery since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath seald chosen thee for herself for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing as nothing as one who has suffered but does not complain a man that fortunes buffets and rewards hast taen with equal thanks and blessd are those whose blood and judgment are so well comingled that they are not a pipe for fortunes finger not finger not controlled by fortune literally not a musical instrument flute to be played by fortune to sound what stop note she please give me that man that is not passions slave and i will wear him in my hearts core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this im dwelling too much on this subject there is a play to night before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my fathers death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment eye of thy soul observe mine uncle if his occulted concealed guilt do not itself unkennel reveal itself in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcans stithy the smithy of vulcan the blacksmith god in roman mythology give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure analysis of his seeming reaction behavior well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and scape detecting i will pay the theft if theft i will watch him as i would watch a known thief if he escapes detection the fault is mine they are coming to the play i must be idle pretend to be deranged get you a place danish march a flourish enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz guildenstern and others how fares our cousin hamlet excellent i faith of the chameleons dish i eat the air promise crammed you cannot feed capons so how fares capons so claudius asks how hamlet is getting along but hamlet pretends that he interprets fares to mean eats he then says he eats what the chameleon eats air it was believed that chameleons fed on air however because the air is fat with promise but empty of actual benefit says hamlet one cannot feed air to capons castrated male chickens hamlet is like a chameleon in that he changes colors that is he becomes a different person in front of claudius however in his effort to nail claudius as the murderer of his father hamlet so far has come up only with air but no substance i have nothing with i do not understand this answer hamlet these words are not mine no nor mine now to polonius my lord you played once i the university you say that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor and what did you enact i did enact julius c sar i was killed i the capitol brutus killed me it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the players ready ay my lord they stay upon your patience come hither my good hamlet sit by me no good mother heres metal a precious metal ophelia more attractive to the king o ho do you mark that lady shall i lie in your lap lying down at ophelias feet no my lord i mean my head upon your lap ay my lord do you think i meant country matters something indecent i think nothing my lord thats a fair thought to lie between maids legs thats legs after ophelia says she thinks nothing hamlet interprets nothing to mean the numerical symbol because of its shape this symbol was sometimes used as a representation of the vulva the external part of the female sex organ what is my lord nothing you are merry my lord who i ay my lord o god your only jig maker o god who is the original merrymaker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died withins two hours nay tis twice two months my lord so long nay then let the devil wear black for ill have a suit of sables since it is so long since my fathers death i will not wear typical black mourning clothes let the devil do that instead i will wear a suit of sables sumptuous black furs suitable for other occasions o heavens die two months ago and not forgotten yet then theres hope a great mans memory may outlive his life half a year but by r lady by the blessed virgin mary he must build churches then churches that are dedicated to his memory or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is for o for o the hobby horse is forgot a hobby horse is a wooden figure of a horse in a dance called the morris a participant wore a costume resembling a hobby horse during the dance the hobby horse died then later rose again and continued the dance like the hobby horse old king hamlet died but later rose to appear to hamlet however because hamlet has not yet avenged his fathers death the spirit of the dead king may feel that he is forgot hautboys oboes play the dumb show part of a play acted without words pantomime the next passage presents the dumb show enter a king and a queen very lovingly the queen embracing him and he her she kneels and makes show of protestation unto him he takes her up and declines his head upon her neck lays him down upon a bank of flowers she seeing him asleep leaves him anon soon comes in a fellow takes off his crown kisses it and pours poison in the kings ears and exits the queen returns finds the king dead and makes passionate action the poisoner with some two or three mutes comes in again seeming to lament with her the dead body is carried away the poisoner woos the queen with gifts she seems loath and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts his love exeunt what means this my lord marry this is miching mallecho sneaky mischief it means mischief belike probably this show imports the argument plot of the play enter prologue we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel theyll tell all will he tell us what this show meant ay or any show that youll show him be not you ashamed to show hell not shame to tell you what it means you are naught you are naught ill mark the play for us and for our tragedy here stooping to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently is this a prologue or the posy of a ring brief poetry inscribed on a ring tis brief my lord as womans love enter two players king and queen player full thirty times hath phoebus cart the sun gone round neptunes salt wash ocean and tellus orbed ground tellus earth goddess in roman mythology and thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been since love our hearts and hymen god of marriage in greek mythology did our hands unite commutual together in most sacred bands player so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count oer ere love be done but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust am worried about you yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must i must not discomfort you for womens fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is sizd my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there player faith i must leave thee i must die love and shortly too my operant powers strength their functions leave to do and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honourd belovd and haply perhaps one as kind for husband shalt thou player o confound the rest such love must needs be treason in my breast it would be treasonous to remarry in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who killd the first aside wormwood wormwood extremely bitter herb used in making absinthe and other alcoholic drinks player the instances that second marriage move the reasons to marry a second time are base respects of thrift financial or social gain but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed player i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break i do break i believe you are sincere about what you vow to do but people often change their minds and break their vows purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be which be unripe fruit remains on the tree ripe fruit falls most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose what to lose in a moment of passion we promise to do such and such but when the passion subsides we forget about our promise the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures actions with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye for aye forever nor tis not strange that even our love should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove wher whether love lead fortune or else fortune fortune lead love whether love leads to good luck or good luck leads to love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the great flies when a great man suffers a downfall notice that his favorite friends abandon him the poor advancd makes friends of enemies the poor enemies when the poor and downtrodden advance they become friends with enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend and tend in the same way success or failure at love may depend on whether a persons fortune is good or bad for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy for who enemy whoever has everything whoever has no needs will never lack a friend but whoever has needs and asks a friend for help will make of that friend an enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead but orderly dead but let me end where i began what we say we want and what fate gives us are often at odds you think that you will not remarry after i die but that thought will die when i die player nor earth to me give food nor heaven light sport and repose lock from me day and night to desperation turn my trust and hope an anchors cheer in prison be my scope each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife nor earth wife if i were to remarry i would deserve no food no heavenly light no rest all my trust and hope would dissolve into desperation the only fit place for me would be a prison with only a hermit monks an anchors cheer to keep me company i would want the opposite of joy i would wish for the destruction of joy if she should break it now what if she breaks her promises player tis deeply sworn i believe you are sincere sweet leave me here awhile my spirits grow dull and fain gladly i would beguile the tedious day with sleep sleeps player sleep rock thy brain and never come mischance between us twain exit madam how like you this play the lady doth protest too much is excessive in her pleas methinks o but shell keep her word have you heard the argument is there no offence in t no no they do but jest poison in jest no offence i the world what do you call the play the mouse trap the title indicates that hamlet wishes to use the play to trap or ensnare claudius marry how tropically tropically pronounced with a long o is an adverb coined from trope meaning figure of speech tropically thus means figuratively this play is the image of a murder done in vienna gonzago is the dukes name his wife baptista you shall see anon tis a knavish mediocre piece of work but what of that your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not let the galled jade wince let the saddle sore horse wince our withers part of a horse between the shoulders are unwrung not pinched not sore hamlet is saying in effect you and i king claudius are free

majesty we majesty we stand ready we believe we have a moral duty to protect everyone who depends on you the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many the cease of majesty dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw whats near it with it it is a massy wheel fixd on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortisd and adjoind which when it falls each small annexment petty consequence attends the boisterous ruin the single ruin a person fiercely protects himself from danger but he is even more fierce when it comes to protecting a ruler such as you upon whom so many lives depend when a monarch falls to ruin he draws down with him like a whirlpool all that is around him another way of putting it is to say that he is like a giant wheel to which is attached his entire kingdom and its people when it rolls down a hill the whole kingdom rolls with it never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put upon this fear which now goes too free

the biblical cain for killing abel upon t a brothers murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brothers blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence whereto offence isnt mercy supposed to bestow itself on the face of the offender and whats in prayer but this two fold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardond being down then ill look up and whats down prayer has a twofold purpose to prevent us from sinning and to pardon us when we do sin my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardond and retain the offence in the corrupted currents of this world offences gilded hand may shove by justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but tis not so above in the above in this corrupt world a criminal can buy a pardon with his wicked prize of gold but he cant buy off heaven there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelld even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests there rests you cannot bargain with heaven you must face the true nature of your wicked deeds the evidence cannot be altered try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one can not repent try repent i could repent but i cannot repent if i am to remain king and keep my gains o

father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven in lines hamlet speaks of a new dilemma if he kills claudius claudius could go to heaven what kind of revenge would that be claudius on the other hand killed king hamlet when the latter had sin on his soul the old king ended up in purgatory but why does hamlet think claudius could merit heaven like all good catholic boys hamlet believed only god could judge the goodness or badness of a person as line suggests but in our circumstance and course of thought tis heavy with him and am i then revengd to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and seasond for his passage no up sword and know thou a more horrid hent act of grasping or holding when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed at gaming swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in t then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damnd and black as hell whereto it goes my mother stays this physic but prolongs thy sickly days exit in lines hamlet says he will wait until he is sure claudius has sin on his soul

the queen may be comparing herself to a stage drama the horrible act that she committed is one of the acts of the play it is so egregious that it stands out even in the table of contents she asks

except hamlet how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and god like reason to fust in us unusd now wher it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event a thought which quarterd hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this things to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do t examples gross as earth exhort me how exhort me everything i encounter seems to accuse me of delaying my revenge what good is a man if all he does is sleep and eat surely the god that made us into beings with great intelligence enabling us to learn from the past and consider the future judiciously did not intend us to allow our god given reason to grow moldy with disuse now whether i am just a dumb animal or a coward afraid to act i do not know yet i cling to the thought of gaining revenge and i have the motive will strength and means to do it the examples of others urge me on witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffd makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an egg shell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honours at the stake how stand i then witness at the stake the delicate prince who leads this huge army is not delaying his mission he is ready to risk his life even over a paltry matter true greatness in a man is not measured by whether he will fight over a major issue but by whether he will fight over a minor issue when his honor is at stake that have a father killd a mother staind excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that have sleep that have a father who has been murdered a mother who has been defiled disturbances in my intellect and my blood and a

must find me innocent in the death of your father and you must put me in your heart for friend sith since you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursud my life it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats why feats why you did not punish hamlet for his actions so crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirrd up o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd weak but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive attached to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count trial i might not go is the great love the general gender citizens bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves shackles to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come whose revenge whose worth if i may look back to it in better times challenged anyone to find a woman who was as perfect as she was but i will have my revenge break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more break pastime dont lose any sleep over how to deal with hamlet i am not so passive that i can pass off danger as a game youll hear more about this later i lovd your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine enter a messenger how now what news letters my lord from hamlet this to your majesty this to the queen from hamlet who brought them sailors my lord they say i saw them not they were given me by claudio he receivd them of him that brought them laertes you shall hear them leave us exit messenger the king reads high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom to morrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing know you the hand tis hamlets character handwriting naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me im lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus diddest thou you committed this terrible crime if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruld by me as me and why shouldnt it be so will you take my advice ay my lord so you will not oer rule me to a peace so peace as long as you dont advise me to make peace to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means as voyage deciding to end his voyage no more to undertake it i will work maneuver him to an exploit now ripe in my device ready to execute under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice uncharge the practice see no foul play and call it accident my lord i will be ruld the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ i will organ i will go along with your plan especially if you make me the instrument of hamlets death it falls right you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege you have siege you have been much talked about within the hearing of hamlet for an excellent quality of yours in hamlets eyes that quality overshadows all of your other qualities he envies it i myself think that quality is not your best what part quality is that my lord a very riband in the cap of youth riband ribbon used as a decoration or displayed as a reward of achievement yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness for graveness light and careless clothes are just as appropriate on youth as dignified sables and other dark clothes are on aged persons to reflect their health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy part of france ive seen myself and servd against the french and they can well can do well on horseback but this gallant norman had witchcraft in t in his horsemanship he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as he had been incorpsd and demi naturd with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did as he did as if he had become part of the brave beast he performed on that horse far beyond my expectations for him and i could never duplicate his feats a norman was t a norman upon my life lamond the very same i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers fencers swordsmen of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposd them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him now out of this what out of this my lord laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart why ask you this not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer but ulcer but to get to the point of whats eating at you hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words to cut his throat i the church no place indeed should murder sanctuarize no sanctuarize indeed a murderer such as hamlet should be fair game even in the sanctuary of a church revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence well excellence well have people praise your excellent swordsmanship and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine short together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse examine the foils practice swords blunted on the end so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated sharp not blunted and in a pass of practice practice lunge requite kill him for your father i will do t and for that purpose ill anoint poison the tip of my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm remedy poultice so rare collected from all simples medicines that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance our performance our purpose to kill hamlet casts suspicion on us twere better not assayd tried therefore this project should have a back backup plan or second that might hold if this should blast in proof fail soft pay attention stand at attention take note let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings well have bets on the outcome of the fencing match i ha t when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink ill have prepard him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomd stuck our purpose may hold there but stay what noise when in there during the match dance around so that hamlet does the same when both of you become sweaty and thirsty i will have a chalice with a poisoned drink ready to give him if he escapes unscathed from the fencing the drink will kill him enter queen how now sweet queen one woe doth tread upon anothers heel so fast they follow your sisters drownd laertes drownd o

talked about last night it wont be long before we put our plan into action good gertrude set some watch over your son this grave shall have a living lasting monument an hour of quiet shortly shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be exeunt act scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and horatio so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance remember it my lord sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines mutineers in the bilboes rashly bilboes a bilbo is a bar with fetters that are attached to the feet of prisoner and praisd be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometimes serves us well when our deep plots do pall fail and that should teach us theres a divinty that shapes god shapes our ends rough hew them how we will that is most certain up from my cabin my sea gown heavy coat with a high collar scarfd wrapped about me in the dark gropd i to find out them had my desire fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew gropd packet i groped around and found the packet containing the message to the king of england to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio o royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmarks health and englands too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off an exact struck off an exact command interspersed with niceties and greetings from our king to the english king that i was to be beheaded without delay upon my arrival in england is t possible heres the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed i beseech you being thus be netted ensnared round with villanies villainies ere i could make a prologue to my brains ere brains before i could think over what to do next they had begun the play i sat me down devisd a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists statesmen do a baseness to write fair and labourd much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeomans service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ay good my lord an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm should flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many such like ases plural of as of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowd an earnest allowd i started with a statement from claudius that england was faithful to denmark and that love between the two countries should further flourish in a peaceful relationship with peace joining the two countries as a comma joins clauses and phrases then i added many other other sentences and clauses beginning with as and ended with a command to put the bearers of the message to death immediately even before they had time to confess their sins to god through a priest how was this seald why even in that was heaven ordinant helpful giving me guidance i had my fathers signet ring with a seal used as a stamp to endorse or authenticate documents in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribd it gave t th impression stamp placd it safely the changeling substituted document never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent what sequent what followed thou knowst already so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to t go to their death why man they did make love to this employment they employment they relished the idea of taking me to england to die they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites they are opposites their fate does not bother my conscience their downfall resulted from their own wilfull interference in my affairs its dangerous for lesser mortals like them to become involved in conflicts between opponents holding high positions in the realm why what a king claudius is this horatio is really saying why what an evil king is this does it not thinks t thee stand me now upon he that hath killd my king and whord my mother poppd in between the election and my hopes deprived me of being elected king thrown out his angle for my proper life hath given the order to kill me and with such cozenage deceit is t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is t not to be damnd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil is t not evil is it not perfectly justified to kill him with this sword and would i not be damned for allowing this evil man to live to commit more evil it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there it must there he will soon find out what happened in england it will be short the interim is mine and a mans lifes no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his ill count his favours but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion it will passion it wont be long before he finds out but ill have time to act in the interim i must say horatio that i am sorry i lost my temper when i confronted laertes at the grave site he too suffered great loss ill try to be cordial with him it was just that his outward display of grief rankled me peace who comes here enter osric osric is a courtier one who is a fixture at the court of a monarch a typical courtier was at the service of the ruler and often flattered him to gain favors and improve his standing at court your lordship is right welcome back to denmark i humbly thank you sir aside to horatio dost know this water fly insignificant creature aside to hamlet no my good lord aside to horatio thy state of not knowing osric is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt let a beast dirt when a man regardless of his human worth becomes lord of something he gains favor at court and dines with the king hes nothing but a crow chough but as i say he has lots of dirt land sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit your bonnet to his right use tis for the head your head put your hat on its for the head osric had removed his hat to show his respect probably insincere for prince hamlet i thank your lordship tis very hot no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly it is indifferent somewhat cold my lord indeed but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as twere i cannot tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter i beseech you remember hamlet moves him to put on his hat nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences qualities that set him apart from others of very soft society gentle upbringing and great showing impressive appearance indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card standard or calendar example of gentry for you shall find in him the continent complete package of what part a gentleman would see of what a gentleman should be sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more sir nothing more sir your description of him is glowing and i realize that trying to present an inventory of all of his good qualities would make you dizzy if he were the captain of a ship we couldnt catch him no matter how much we yawed swerved this way or that truly in praising him i must say he is a great soul he is unique when he looks into a mirror he sees the only one who can equal him everyone else who would follow him walks in his shadow umbrage your lordship speaks most infallibly of him the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath the concernancy breath why are we talking about this man sir is t not possible to understand in another tongue cant you talk to him in plainer language you will do t sir really what imports the nomination of this gentleman what is the purpose of bringing up this subject of laertes his purse is empty already all s golden words are spent of him sir i know you are not ignorant i would you did sir in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i would me im glad you know that sir but im not satisfied you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself i mean sir for his weapon fencing skill but in the imputation reputation laid on him by them in his meed ability hes unfellowed unrivaled whats his weapon rapier and dagger thats two of his weapons but well the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary north african horses against the which he has imponed pledged staked as i take it six french rapiers and poniards daggers with their assigns accessories as girdle belt hangers straps attached to the belt to hold up a scabbard and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit what call you the carriages i knew you must be edified by the margent be curious about the meaning of some words ere you had done the carriages sir are the hangers the phrase would be more german germane pertinent to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides if you were talking about cannons instead of swords i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish why is this imponed as you call it the king sir hath laid wagered that in a dozen passes between yourself and him laertes he shall not exceed you three hits shall not defeat you by no more than three hits in other words the king supposedly is betting on hamlet if laertes spots the prince three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine twelve hits for laertes to nine hits for hamlet and it would come to immediate trial a match held right now if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer how if i answer no i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial let me be clear my lord im talking about testing yourself in a competition against laertes sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits sir i will odd hits sir i will walk here in the hall its the time of day when i like to get exercise meanwhile let the preparation begin for the fencing match i will try to fight to make the king win his bet if i fail i will suffer only a little shame and some hits from laertes sword shall i re deliver you so shall i quote you on that to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will to will you may tell him the gist of what i said with whatever fancy words youd like to add i commend my duty to your lordship yours yours exit osric he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for s turn he does turn he does well to commend his duty no one else will commend him for anything this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head this head the lapwing a small bird can move around moments after it hatches it may run off even when pieces of its shell are still attached to its body he did comply with his dug before he sucked it he used to praise the nipple of his mother or wet nurse before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same bevy kind that i know the drossy worthless trivial age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out only got out his only talent is to act like everyone else and speak the same words yesty collection that carry his kind through their conversations and opinions winnowed of substance they try to attach great meaning to their words but the words are full of air like bubbles enter a lord lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play fence with laertes or that you will take longer time his majesty time after the king sent osric to deliver his message to you osric reported back to the king and now asks you to meet him in the hall he wishes to know whether you want to have the fencing match now or later i am constant to my purposes they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now lord the king and queen and all are coming down in happy time that suits me well lord the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment gentle words or treatment to laertes before you fall to play she well instructs me exit lord you will lose this wager my lord i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter but heart but be aware that i feel a bit uneasy in my heart nay good my lord it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman it is woman its really nothing rather like a misgiving that would perhaps trouble a woman if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither stop them from coming and say you are not fit not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what is t to leave betimes let be not a let be no dont do that i defy omens or foreboding feelings after all it is god who oversees our destiny if a sparrow dies now it was meant by heaven to die now and not later if the sparrow does not die now it was meant by heaven to die later see matthew in the new testament of the bible what is important is to be prepared for whatever happens to you no man retains anything of what he leaves behind when he dies so what does it matter if a man dies an early death let things stand as they are enter king queen laertes lords osric and attendants with foils c come hamlet come and take this hand from me the king puts the hand of laertes into that of hamlet give me your pardon sir ive done you wrong but pardon t as you are a gentleman this presence

sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither march within enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others where is this sight what is it ye would see if aught anything of woe or wonder cease your search if aught search if you mean anything tragic or terrible to behold this is the place this quarry harvest of animals hunted down killed and piled in a heap cries on havoc disorder chaos destruction o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck o proud struck o death you must be planning a great banquet in your eternal abode considering that you took the lives of so many royal persons in a single moment first the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him king claudius his commandment is fulfilld that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks where thanks since the king is dead he cannot thank us for delivering our message not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question but question but since you wonder what happened here that spilled so much blood you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrivd give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause and in this upshot purposes mistook falln on the inventors heads all this can i truly deliver and in deliver and ironically murderous plots that went awry and killed the very persons who hatched them i can tell you the whole story let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience call the noblemen hereabouts to listen for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory entitlements in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me which me which i now plan to claim of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performd even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen of that happen on this matter id like to disclose to you hamlets last wishes even at this upsetting time so that we can avoid further plots and upheavals let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have provd most royally and for his passage for he royally for he was likely had he lived to have been a great ruler the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss such a sight amiss this site is appropriate for a battlefield but not for a hall in a kings castle go bid the soldiers shoot a dead march exeunt bearing off
