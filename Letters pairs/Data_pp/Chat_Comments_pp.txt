goldshire build in valheim tried to capture as much detail as i could the path leads all the way back to stormwind and i will be detailing the forest with the graveyards etc next stop lakeshire hope you like it well looks like im re rolling a human warrior for the hundredth time god damn starting zone music this is scarily accurate awesome job how long did it take you thanks ive been on and off

and why does that music always hit me in the heart walking through goldshire right now even the trees are placed properly and with the same relative width and tree type are you okay this is amazing to the point of concern is that with the games normal weight physics turned off i remember those were brutal lol i would assume its done in creative mode would be hard to get the dvergr there without spawning them also i think the only way to get the barrels there would be spawning them in too still takes a lot of time effort and thought to do a build like this though when i see the title i was scared that it would required a nsfw tag lol its safe to assume thats why we didnt get to see the basement of the inn seeing all those rabbits tells me this is moon guard wow its amaziingg i cant wait to see your next post this is gorgeous almost seems like noblegarden time with all the bunnies too incredible man would love to see updated graphics for a wow or something using unreal engine now tame

gets too busy and resub back when a new expansion hits hoping it would bring with it some of the feeling i still get whenever i portal to stormwind and know those pesky bandits are right outside the gates theres simply nothing that can erase that first toon memories of hoofing it to westfall with a boring ass horse to go do deadmines with that first green drop lakeshire is one of my favourite villages in a game its neck and neck with kakariko village from ocarina of time on the n for me love both equally and couldnt pick and outright favourite looking forward to your lakeshire creation not moonguard for sure meanwhile people from the moon guard server be looking at the inside of the inn and be like its missing something gotta knock points off because i dont see any naked draenei dancing

file totally amazing could you imagine if the whole game looked like this i just want to give you props dude i tried playing valheim and really wanted to enjoy it because it seemed like my cup of tea but i found the building system to be so janky this is impressive the building system is the best part of the game and has very little jank compared to any building game except probably minecraft what exactly was the issues you were having as choppy as vanilla thats attention to detail wow great work beautiful never played valheim but i can appreciate the effort this took for sure does this use mods to achieve this look and stuff well done op this is basass dude makes me yearn for a wow this is so so good great work i would re sub if all of wow looks like this didnt recognise it without all

be in the plains i presume this is clearly a labour of love and gives me alliance feels back to the login screen i go this is amazing great work im interested how did you find such a flat terrain seed or was it all manually flattened that was amazing this is amazing this is awesome kings honor friend do razor hill next need someone to start working on brill china needs to establish wage and price controls china near shanghai im genuinely confused as to why the nytimes reports so much on china i mean for me a person living in china its helpful to read some of these largely negative perspectives that are typically devoid of any rationale as to why the chinese government does what it does beyond the assertion that china is a brutal and duplicitous authoritarian state but why do folks in the states care what china is up to massive trade partner large economy and has a different global approach than the us i am focusing on as neutral as possible terms by the by hence it is news by the nature of its existence maybe we have investments because its the second largest economy in the world the same statement is true for the us bidens economic narrative looks different inflated so to speak from what is happening on main street things in the us are looking pretty good for many on main st with very low unemployment and wages rising what do you expect china has simply degenerated into another failing corrupt conservative society tearing the world economy apart its fun seeing all the totally organic commentary from people who are trying to make this story about america and the us economy yes guys what about america a classic diversionary tactic its worst economic slowdown of last year was growth and that in the jaws of yo yo ing between excessive lockdowns and a huge first national covid wave and that nominal gdp growth must naturally flatten as its population peaks no mature economy can or should sustain growth of pa chinas problems are structural imbalances of the kind that have been features of capitalism high youth unemployment not unlike europe in the face of not just mechanisation but urbanisation undue investment in real estate familiar to the us australia ireland etc etc the bbc reports home ownership of nearly so theres limited renting and up to of owners have a second apartment even discounting the numbers of parents owning a second apartment to help children thats a huge potential bubble given not many second apartments are lifestyle getaways how is that different from here the biden administration keeps touring its economic achievements but the average american feels angst over inflation ravaging their purchasing power unaffordable houses rents and continued warnings from professional economics that the u s may be heading into a recession deep thinker tbf us employment is strong chinas youth unemployment rate is very serious i forgot to mention americans are also worried because their credit card debt is now at record highs denying reality and democracy for a living while projecting blame for their own corruption and incompetence on imaginary and foreign scapegoats the breakfast of dictators despots and authoritarians worldwide see china russia and republistan for reference hmmmmm why does that sounds eerily similar to how americans feel it is absolutely past time for the us to decouple from china end all missions exchanges student visas and immigration just end it the nixon experiment failed big time the great know it all xi will inevitably make a decree that the economy should be good and it will be good and you better agree or else a fertility rate of replacement would be that is the key statistic to measure what young chinese think about their prospects they have lost confidence in the leadership and that means transitioning to a consumer based economy is almost impossible a closed information apparatus will always have credibility problems distrust is inevitable when a country is treated like a potemkin village some of this is a different way of thinking or quite different housing for instance is doing very good its supposed to be down given the chinese governments history of punishing people who speak out why would all these people openly complain i still think what were seeing is more about china trying to convince the world they are no threat than a true crisis it is a shame that only in china does the media distribute what those on decision making positions want to hear which excludes criticism of media itself how difficult it is to have a functioning economy when the emperor can suddenly shut it down on a whim maybe they will learn one day that change must be aimed at the top in order to solve this the chinese government has stolen the hope of its people welcome to the pains and gains of capitalism as dr m l king said capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources with this system a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level thats the way the system works capitalism in china should not be viewed only as progress in production but also in knowledge for many years the fidel castro regime in cuba criticized capitalism for not being able to eliminate poverty and he was correct while capitalism can mitigate poverty through social transfers it is nearly impossible to eradicate the processes that create poverty under capitalism in summary it seems that poverty is inherent to capitalism and that a lower standard of living and lower wages are needed in capitalism for its perpetuation why should it be different in china china is communist though most decisions are made centrally by a politburo three years of rigid covid policy coupled with a real estate boom spurred on by central planning creating entirely empty cities is hardly capitalism cloves agree i think what you are saying is absolutely inevitable for a developing consumer economy like china these are the growing pains if you will cloves capitalism is what allowed china to lift m people from poverty since the late s they are highs and lows but china is vastly richer now china is afraid of its people they tightly regulate what can be said and insist on happy talk in the meantime they have a huge problem with unemployed youth which they wont talk about having millions of unemployed young people with access to the internet is a recipe for major problems the other issue is that since no one is allowed to talk about problems they are ignored and continue to grow until the situations blows up in a catastrophe it would be far better to admit there is a problem and work on it while it is small and can be fixed but that is not how the chinese system works bruce if thats true why are all these people speaking to western media all the problems confronting china will soon be ours too but because of its rapid trajectory its a bellwether going through all the stages of a sick economy in quick succession and you can rest assured our politicians will be just as unimaginative craven and deliberately obtuse as their ccp counterparts to address matters before they get ugly weve temporarily solved our problem through record credit card debt as people struggle to maintain their rapidly dwindling standard of living youll never hear this statistic mentioned when we hear about the miracle of bidenomics where our economy is literally a house of cards diminished employment prospects among the young and educated and unaffordable housing its hard to tell which country im referring to who pray tell is supposed to buy all those evs rolling out of the factories when their credit line is zero yes what about whataboutism i visited china in july my observation there is more consistent with chinese media than what nyt reports chinas big problem is the real estate market it makes everyone hesitate to spend but otherwise consumer spending car sale and tourism expenditure are going up this year apple and tesla sales are very strong in china which is also an indication china has undergone the largest rural to urban migration in all of recorded history in the past years it should come as no surprise to anyone that a mass movement of this scale should be accompanied by unrest inequality and fading prospects the chinese government clams up in times of turmoil which is why well never know the true extent of these economic issues rising literacy and gdp per capita means you dont want to work in service rather than production its physically easier more lucrative and offers the highest ceiling for the first countries to make this shift thats fine the rest of the world continued to make the products these increasingly rich countries could afford to buy in larger quantities the problem is that this process makes producing countries more wealthy and while the so called communist government of china was able to suppress that wealth getting to most of the workforce for decades that could never be sustained service industry jobs are lucrative because they act as force multipliers for productive industries therefore they are very efficient value producers hence why they are paid more but only if productive industries are present however while all this is happening technological development makes productive industries more efficient as well lowering the need for workers in those sectors in effect theres nowhere to fall back to for those transitioning from production to service so you have a workforce that demands service industry jobs a service industry that has increasingly fewer productive industries to service and productive industries that need less people to function this leads to lower demand for everything products and services as economies deflate like air leaving a punctured tire this is the natural progression of capitalism and is unavoidable under this system we will be on the same track soon economy is slowing and the feds want it that way to cool inflation therell be a couple of years of slowdown ahead then the feds will start printing money again almost like in the us where we constantly get headlines like bidens economy is great why arent voters giving him credit despite the income to home price ratio growing at record high rates and peoples average standard of living getting worse at roughly the same rate it has for decades these are interesting stories about a few individuals and i understand that creating a narrative this way is the core nyt style but are there any data polls that say how people feel about the economy about the direction of their country about their political leaders polls that segment the population in to rich poor urban rural educated uneducated how about just data like homelessness today versus years ago changes in the of the population unemployed as a reader i am never convinced by anecdotal story telling john agree in the data need but it is also the point of the piece china government figures are not reliable if you do business with china you will hear enough stories to form a reliable view that companies are in travel in my business which covers multiple sectors you hear of average order size down volumes down there is a definite problem going into q and the real economy of smes is slowing significantly add to that the indisputable data available on real estate debt defaults and the fact this was central to prior years growth are wealthy chinese insulated from the economic woes if that were true theyd return to touring europe in huge numbers and that hasnt happened there have been very few chinese tourists in europe this year compared to pre pandemic years the problem is worse than that china is in debt bomb economic crash and demographic crash there is no possible recovery only social economic and governmental crash a war with taiwan would make worse because to would also kill imports and cause a famine that would kill half chinese population from your fingertips to gods eyeballs id rather lose half a billion chinese to famine than half a billion americans europeans and others plus half a billion chinese to the war that theyre planning xi might be a terrible leader but the chinese economy is not doomed just as biden and democratic party led economy are not doomed for failure frideswide not doomed but when has an economic bubble not burst no economy is necessarily doomed but all economies wax wane it seems animal spirits are as much a part of the chinese hybrid command control economy as any other unsurprisingly the us economy again is defying negative expectations i believe we can thank bidens steady leadership on the other hand britain appears to be rising up to its pundits negative expectations sean t except here you can see new car sales are strong and prices are high new home sales are strong and prices are high airline fares are high due to strong demand and unemployment claims remain low maybe your retail business is just in the wrong trend there are signs of weakness in the us economy but also incredible signs of strength patrick i said retail but i meant restaurant which is a mainstream business i think i own an apartment in manhattan and the price on that is also down significantly based on building unit sales compared to who knows maybe its just manhattan that is suffering and the rest of the country is doing great poll numbers dont seem to suggest that is the reality though i wonder if the difficulties you are having are still connected to so many commuters not commuting into nyc for work discouraging people to think for themselves inevitably results in less innovation chinas economy will suffer and indeed already is the companies of the future will not originate in the country if its government continues to stifle free enterprise just another example how actions have consequences china threatens taiwan india vietnam the philippines the united states and indirectly europe and they expected business to continue as usual scott covid started in wuhan in the fall of and china did not warn the world sorry didnt read the entire article let me guess republicans oppose this there is no reason that an agency that pays for billions on these drugs should not use that to leverage better pricing its the central pillar of how walmart runs tell the republicans its just business it is absurd that medicare has ever been required to pay whatever the monopolistic pharmaceutical companies dictate especially since they seem to have no objection to negotiating with private health insurance companies and foreign socialized and singlepayer medical care systems this is a long overdue reform and i personally am quite pleased by it because the two most expensive medications i take both ridiculously expensive are on the list the cost for xarelto was for a thirty day supply with the use of insurance if you were able to get from a canadian pharmacy it was for a thirty day supply negotiation what a swat team with heavy weapons conducts with a criminal negotiation what the government does with drug companies if a manufacturer refuses to negotiate or wont agree to what federal rules call a maximum fair price the company will face a substantial tax or must withdraw from medicare and medicaid at least call them by some more accurate term big pharma says that negotiations are a threat to innovation the only threat is to their profits what about the research they receive at a reduced cost or free from government nih shouldnt they pay fair market value i know of a drug that has a copay of for a month supply the pharmacy says it saves money to get the month supply its hilariously unfunny that there is a different side of this debate republicans are absolutely corrupt and shameless when did you first notice this interesting fact its a start more than any other pres has done for us keep it going pres biden consumers will not see benefits swiftly with the lower negotiated prices due to become available in early alas more trickle down eventual benefits if the patients live long enough to actually experience them this mornings early jump upward in the stock prices of major pharmaceutical companies bears this out gotta love johnson johnson in their court filings they claim that they have a constitutional right to your tax money god bless them way to go joe im no shill for big pharma but the industry is hardly the boogeyman in americas dismal industrial healthcare landscape few of us would enjoy the lives we lead today absent the miraculous drugs and biologics the industry has been delivering for decades while generating life saving life altering and life enhancing products that dwarf the outputs of virtually every other science and technology based industries that are heralded for their products what americans pay out of pocket for medicines is solely attributable to the failure of the american political system to provide american citizens and residents with cradle to grave health insurance which is the birthright of hundreds of millions of citizens and residents living in other advanced industrial states lower medicare drug costs means lower taxes will the gqp buy in thank you president biden who understands his mission to serve the public as best as he can to win republican support that statute included language that prohibited any role for the government to negotiate medication prices the inflation reduction act known as ira rescinded the prohibition and this is why one has to wonder why any person in their right mind would ever vote for a republican especially if they are not wealthy democrats work for the common good and the working class republicans worship at the altar of greed and corporate money i take eliquis mgs twice daily and pay for three months because i am blessed to have great medical and prescription insurance from my retirement plan if i had to pay the retail price it would be plus for the same amount it seems my prescription plan negotiated a better price so should medicare be denied the same price i am on medicare im not sure why eliquis is on that list go to their website and sign up for discounts i pay a month now are you on medicare and does it apply if you are the only reason you get a discount is because someone else is paying full price read the fine print bottom line a political trick designed to mislead as the article notes these drugs will be available as low cost generics very soon ergo its all being done with big pharmas interests in mind lol the joke is on you owl big pharma often makes minor tweaks to the formulations of proprietary drugs just before they are due to go generic and thereby extending the period they can charge full price for it they have many ways to manipulate our laws to insure they remain among the most profitable industries not just in the us but in the entire world republicans have been fighting this for decades this is one of the bigger wins for biden and we owe him and his team and the dems who supported this in congress a vote of thanks it is long past due will be fun to watch republicans arguing that its outrageous that the federal government is using its massive purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices for the benefit of all americans maybe just maybe it will begin to dawn on lunch pail americans that republicans dont really have their best interests at heart for what its worth with life essential pharmaceutics thats quite a lot imbruvica already has at least two descendent drugs that cost knee buckling amounts of money literally unaffordable for anyone who is not a multi millionaire or wealthier who does not have robust health insurance coverage a long running issue we know about is drugs with clinically minimal modifications being developed that satisfy statutory criteria for qualifying as a new drug but clinically are for all intents and purposes cosmetic and do not justify the exorbitant prices of those drugs this phenomenon has been true of drugs to treat diabetes hypertension and other chronic health problems when dealing with life threatening life shortening health problems leaving solutions up to raw capitalism essentially creates a system of extortion of holding our lives hostage for profits those developing life saving life essential drugs deserve fair compensation but not what the market will bear when the market is people dying that is a big part of why human societies developed governments in the first place from tribal councils to member parliaments either we have equal rights as defined by equal access to life saving life essential medications or we dont so i ask although it seems insane are the nations seniors currently paying more for drugs than they are for food sure looks that way from what i read here health insurance in the us costs they typical family about that does not include out of pocket expenses big pharma is going to hate this expect lots of political adds paid for by big pharma telling us all that grandma is going to die if we cut their profits this is good example of what biden is doing to hurt the economy having medicare negotiate with drug companies to reduce prices on popular prescription drugs this is obviously big government over reach into how the private sector operates in the economy just because people are dying because they cant afford necessary drugs is no excuse for socialism did you get that from fox news i think its sarcasm it wont be when fox says it i can buy these drugs in other countries for a fraction of what they charge here and we the taxpayer often subsidize the research and clinical trials for these pharma companies yet we bear the burden of outrageous profits to shareholders and execs this is a prime example of quality leadership for which it would seem you are unfamiliar or you forgot s at the end of your joke its about time this is great news unfortunately like everything else in this country when a president wants to affect real change for its citizens your gonna see big pharma ramping up their lobbying probably lawsuits but its us taxpayers that pay for the research on drugs big pharma just reaps the profits at the end of the day this system has to change all other industrialized countries can negotiate drug prices except the u s richest country in the world but a third world country when it comes to our health care system and its drug pricing we should also prohibit advertising of prescription drugs the washington lobbyists just love this big pharma will be wheel barrowing in money to them after all ceos and bod cant survive on only a markup finally the george w bush administration expanded medicare drug coverage to not include price negotiation because they knew the incoming obama administration would include it seniors like me have doctors who prescribe drugs which may not be the best but what we can afford i thought is was because bid pharma financed w this is why i love joe biden for president can anyone imagine a trump or desantis even countenancing doing something for ordinary people like this they are more like one of the early scenes in the handmaids tale where after rounding up a group of women they start taking the walkers away from disabled and pushing girls with downs syndrome into their own line bad news for martin shkreli and his ilk finally it took three years ive been waiting for this for quite a while and why must it be limited to ten with all the data and information we have available this looks like a task that should take three months not three years glad to see this story got moved to the top of the front page where it belongs it is vastly more important than mark meadows a good start biden administration now we wait for the outlandish cries of socialism from the lying right queue the gloom and doom from big pharma that this will take away our medicines that ignores the fact that britain france germany and switzerland all have major pharmaceutical companies and all regulate the price of drugs while the press chases negative narratives and rs try and distract with cultural boogeymen president biden keeps working hard for all americans joe biden has a special interest group the good news is that it is us loving this comment gandalf about time how many people have died becuase of the high cost of health in this country big pharma has no concerns about the unmet health needs of patients only their profits not being able to negotiate prices was done by george w s administration specifically dick i have not heart cheny this is another reason to vote blue republicans only care about their donors money there are many drugs used to treat immune disorders i have been on biologics for over twenty years and they have helped me immensely but at huge cost have always had good insurance but that is another matter as my rheumatologist pointed out to me when the monthly cost of treatment is essentially the same regardless of the medication it can only be price fixing its blatantly obvious i worked in molecular genetics and biology research over thirty years the pharmaceutical industry knows how to make monoclonals at very large scale they are profiteering at obscene levels has anyone ever seen a forensic audit of the true costs of these biologics welcome to capitalism almost all of these drugs are recognizable from advertisements on tv and in publications do the drug companies pass on the cost of mass advertising to he consumer i for one am sick of seeing these drug ads they infer that people can tell their doctor what drug to treat them with does anyone read the side effects at the end of the ads i didnt think so that is the reason that drugs companies advertise doctors have a difficult time convincing patients they dont need an advertised drug without advertising how would we know we have rls restless leg syndrome thankfully in ireland you dont see ads for drugs ever not allowed then ireland would make a good control group to better understand the impact of pharmaceutical advertising on sales and medical outcomes commercials for drugs should be forbidden like commericals for tobacco these are not consumer products since consumers cannot even buy them without a prescription all this leads to is know nothing patients badgering their doctors the push for price negotiation faced intense opposition from pharmaceutical companies which contend that capping potential earning erodes their ability to invest in further research and development no it will not affect future research it will just hit the already bloated and obscene bottom line of the drug companies and their investors bingo still seething the makers of eliquis successfully sued to keep their patent until when the fda had at least one generic approved for use greed pure greed indeed a family member pays for a months supply insurance wont cover it for some mysterious reason through my plan just found out the manufacturer does have a co pay card you can sign up for havent tried to use it yet but the neighbor who told me about it says it has saved her a ton but not insulin insulin was already price capped as part of the ira insulin is already capped novolog is insulin it is on the list im glad biden is doing this only thing trump ever did was give tax breaks to the billionaires who own the drug companies another thing republicans will look to kill if theyre in power why benefit patients when there are insurance executive pockets to line which turn into campaign contributions i know people on some of these drugs they are prohibitively expensive and i can see why some people go bankrupt or maybe even just prefer to die that is the outcome heartless republicans want it doesnt happen to them because congress has cadillac health insurance i would say that i hope it happens to someone they love except that they dont know how to love so it wouldnt change a thing thank you president biden and all the democrats who made this historic bill possible my wife was prescribed an inhaler here in the us per month in her native australia six dollars my sister got her inhaler from canada with her doctors blessing it was so expensive in the usa much cheaper there when biden announced the price cap on insulin i checked the average median i cant remember price of all insulin delivery methods in oecd countries and it was us of course this doesnt mean biden didnt make a reasonable effort but it demonstrates how terrible our healthcare insurance system is and how americans are played for suckers yet we have a party the gqp that completely opposed bidens actions and of the population that agrees with the gqp and is willing to get screwed though of them need the discount are inhalers even on the list joe and the democrats continue to govern to help people while the gqp prop up their cult leader investigates hunter and may impeach joe vote blue thank you president biden for this long overdue common sense legislation and republicans continue to work and vote against their constituents best interests and those who vote for them do so not realizing how muuch they are hurting themselves j j says its worried about how this will affect their ability to address patients unmet medical needs without a hint that they realize the irony of patients currently being priced out of addressing their medical needs theyre not alone in not getting it theyre just the only ones who said it out loud the cost for eliquis or entresto for a medicare part d participant is over per initial day supply most doctors do not realize the cost not many people can afford that so whats the alternative a less efficient drug or no treatment coumadin is dirt cheap but requires monitoring it was the standard before drugs like eliquis were developed yes but it requires monitoring and has many more side effects my mother who had had two heart valve replacements was on coumadin she couldnt take eliquis the stuff eventually went toxic on her and she died oooo i got this family member has been on coumadin warfarin for years it requires frequent monitoring dietary changes are recommended and side effects said family member can tell when the levels are off because of the pain and cramping another family member was recently put on eliquis no side effects of note no monitoring but a whopping co pay with bluecross blueshield insurance damned if you do and damned if you dont thats what it feels like the cost of drugs in u s is a national disgrace vote blue when i tell my friends in the uk and europe what we pay for prescriptions they are utterly gobsmacked yup its a start long over due now lets hope the republiclowns dont undermine it somehow dont vote for repulicans any of them something is better than nothing however there are well over prescription drugs on the u s market so of them is of the prescription drugs sold wow and the reason we had a list of thousands and but the big pharma lobby forced the hand of congress with kickbacks to their campaigns and the kept whittling down the list until we to wound up with just can we please shut down k street and our insidious system of crony capitalism they have created and take our country back from these nearly invisible corporate oligarchs that are destroying our republic start by voting a straight blue ticket and then put pressure on those elected while there may be drugs sold the vast majority of prescriptions for about of them some of them already have generic versions so this is a significant improvement of course more must be done repubs will say this will stop innovation when in fact they wrote into law that medicare was prevented from negotiating with drug companies how many other things does the government buy where price negotiation is forbidden by law reuters link below lists the drugs no mention of this anywhere on fox propagandas website their followers have no idea this is happening trump is in trouble with his court cases so fox is too busy talking about hunter and wokeism in order to distract their viewers they are busy telling people how woke dems are paying children to change their sex if anyone credible adding to the list is reading this consider adding xtandi and xgeva both are cancer treatment drugs xtandi was approved in and has no generic cost k month xgeva was approved in and has no generic cost k months without my insurance i am not sure what i would do to pay for these treatments are we supposed to die if we dont have the money or insurance the republican way to reduce both social security and medicare have people die as soon as possible i suspect your insurance companys negotiated rate is only fraction of that price the same as they do for hospital bills in i had a brain tumor removed and spent a week in the icu the hospital bill was over thankfully i had very good insurance and paid less than my insurance company paid their negotiated rate of if i didnt have insurance i wouldve gone bankrupt and lost my house this is why the u s needs a single payer system the bigger the group the more bargaining power it has as long as there is profit in healthcare your health is irrelevant america is broken but nothing in america is as broken as healthcare blame the government blame insurance companies blame the healthcare industry what you pay for healthcare services or pharmaceuticals truly makes no sense and does not seem to follow basic supply and demand pricing its something else and im sure its about big money blame greed supply and demand only works when the demanding person has a choice three month supply of eliquis us canada same product same drug company no other first world country allows its citizenry to be ripped off in the same predatory way that the republicans make sure that the u s citizenry is ripped off reminder if you are not old enough for medicare youll still be paying the price that no other country will allow this is absolutely true it seems to me the u s effectively subsidizes pharma costs for the rest of the world pharma companies have to make a profit they dont exist for sheer altruism if they didnt make a profit investors would go elsewhere and if theyre not making money on eliquis in canada they need to make it somewhere else maybe im wrong of course but it sure looks that way from where im sitting the current cost in england is pre prescription item though you may be eligible for free prescriptions depending on your age or circumstances if you live in scotland wales or northern ireland you do not have to pay for your prescriptions we look on aghast at the system as it stands in america you can get free nhs prescriptions in england if at the time the prescription is dispensed you are or over are under are to and in full time education are pregnant or have had a baby in the previous months and have a valid maternity exemption certificate matex have a specified medical condition and have a valid medical exemption certificate medex have a continuing physical disability that prevents you going out without help from another person and have a valid medical exemption certificate medex hold a valid war pension exemption certificate and the prescription is for your accepted disability are an nhs inpatient ramaswamy said that climate change is a hoax and that he wants to give a hire of ukraine to putin he will never be president haley is intelligent and also a woman when it comes to republican politics she hasnt a snowballs chance she may get the middle ground gop vote but none from the qanon majority other than trump desantis is the only candidate who can actually run on his record and that includes joe yawn the republican plank vote for trump climate change is a hoax the federal government is weaponized against republicans dont talk about abortion because it is unpopular to do so haley is capable of being slimy as much as the others all non starters they should just rebrand and call themselves fascists all hat no cattle theyre all losers the entire spectacle was a waste of air time its pretty bad when nikki haley is the most reasonable person in the room chris christie isnt doing himself any favors hes certainly not wrong about trump but he will never get through to the cultists since this has become nothing but performative art can the next debate feature swim suit competition i dont know whos poll numbers those are but theres no way that desantis won that debate and swammy was obnoxious while nicki haley came across as a reasonable person nobody came across as presidential if any of these freaks make it to the general election they will lose ive never seen another group so off kilter from either a political perspective in their lack of moral character or from the outrageous garbage that they take as political gospel this is absolutely pointless i hope nikki gets out of this travesty she now knows she can develop mass appeal and is simply better than the others maybe the country will survive trump and she can take a shot in but raising her hand was a profound moral effor even christie raised his hand pathetic raising her hand was nothing short of a disqualification for her to be president nimrata is always calculating her odds and goes whichever way the wind blows his name pretty much says it all ramaswarmy ramasmarmy pretty much every republican has made it clear that they intend to abolish womens private choices about reproduction i dont have a reason to support any of them a perceptive and well written analysis thanks the only winner in that debate was donald trump the only thing the of them did was to prove themselves equally unworthy to lead this country true and yet trump is still a loser the biggest loser well then i look forward to seeing joe try to debate him i would certainly love to watch joe biden mop the floor with donald trump once again but since donald trump didnt feel it was worthy to show up and debate joe biden should do the same drama slimy is so intellectually stunted high school hes proof that an ivy league credential compliments of affirmative action and funding from a george soros fellowship is not a guarantee of a good education at the very least hes an educated derelict and an anti intellectual scam typical of a maga circular grift his entrepreneurial accomplishments or a con plishments were all made by cheating and manipulation hes iterating this juvenile malfeasance on the national level touch the problem that haley has is that as she sells herself to the trump faction of the republican party she will tick off the rest of america especially women who may have considered supporting her on the other hand she doesnt sell herself to the yrumpers she will not win the nomination assuming that trump self implodes before the convention ramaswamy says he wants elon musk as an advisor should he become president saying he laid off of the employees at twitter and then the effectiveness actually went up what an idiot he is the next trump the next loser yeah and he vivek is not wrong twitteris so bad off theyve already put an x on their own tombstone haley would be a formidable opponent to biden in a general election but she wont win the nomination this time however i worry about haley and cheney in if trump takes there is no i do think biden harris wins despite real concerns the country will prevail but perhaps only by a thin margin then we have to survive until to see what happens if the trumpers want to have fighting in the streets then the fed will have no choice but to give it to them well see it will be interesting to see what happens to the republicans once trump shuffles off this mortal coil do his voters vote for anybody else and will they move en masse as for democrats plenty waiting in the wings if they want to toss their hat in the ring in granholm klobuchar katie porter mayor pete hakim jeffries just to name a few cheney is a dreadfully awful candidate shell never be on a republican ticket face it this was a clown show where each clown had a slightly different agenda scott vr are running for vp haley is positioning herself for hutchinson and burgum are trying to appeal to a gop that died in pence is clueless neither the pro trump nor anti trump wings of the party want an obsequious toady who thought for himself exactly once in years desantis made the mistake of running to the right of trump mistaking the trump worship for actual hard conservative outlook christie wants another shot at trump and may also surmise that a major republican defeat in might open a few doors for him only desantis and pence are foolish enough to expect to prevail over the whining orange dotard of the collected also rans only haley looks like shell have any political life in thanks seriously for breaking it down for we readers whom wouldnt dare watch it thank you i lasted only min but in that short time i agree with everything you say looking ahead to haley in wonder who the dems will put forward dont think itll be harris i dont get to vote in the closed republican primary left it long ago now but can vote in democratic primary wouldnt be surprised if orange man were convicted he would be taken off the california ballot pence actually is a hologram interesting that republican voters prefer the most despicable candidates by far trump desantis and ramaswamy for those of us that were lifelong republicans please just start referring to donalds cult as the maga party till the old john mccain party starts speaking out before its to late in the meantime ill just keep voting democratic as i have since i gave barack obama my vote from my perspective this was not a well conducted discourse or a debate but a randomly choreographed farce by the moderators who were ignored by the participants no cohesive discussion of policies emerged for magats in the audience to follow through no one won which implies that the alleged criminal indicted for felonies in numerous courts and who was not present at the scene did not lose any ground this event was a favor to biden who needs it to win in the chief magat would be the weakest opponent for him in weakened further by his legal troubles vote blue desantis emerges as the front runner clinging to a week abortion ban regardless of womens and doctor proof it is killing women he takes credit for refusing to allow ap tests which forces students to seek colleges else where as he proclaims the answer ot the s border is to shoot and kill does he think he can win no votes from blue states he wont make it to nh hes spending huge amounts too early and getting the same kind of return on the investment that jeb bush did no but as a floridian ive watched how he gerrymandered our map to go his way ugly little troll by not knowing that the fed not the potus sets interest rates we have one of the worlds lowest inflation rates and its on the decline we are an energy exporter not an energy importer oil prices are a global not domestic phenomenon illegal border crossings are in decline of americans are not in favor of strict abortion bans rather than the opposite as stated by pence unemployment is near record lows and there are over million job openings bullets are the biggest cause of childhood deaths they all disqualified themselves excellent list pence is a posturing pious fool boblesch please run for public office a good list but the average americans only see high interests rates high food prices and gas prices that go up more than down this is what the average voters remember this race will be won on scare tactic campaign advertising may the best ad man or woman win abortion on one side the other side is just all about one thing trump i would have ranked haley pence christie thats because youre looking at from the view of a sane person and not a likely gop primary voter desantis is stripped of any personality since being governor hes done his best to grab headlines for limiting voting rights gutting libraries and narrowing school curriculum what a pathetic human being you lost me with the term human but pathetic certainly works and yet the people ive spoken with thought haley was the clear winner while desantis and ramaswamy came across as both egotistical and unknowledgeable on both domestic and global issues remember what the italians did to benito dont give me nor the american populace any uh ideas hear that conny great article ramaswamy aggressively went after mike pence i believe this was a good tactic by him and his campaign as a result his pro trumpian lean could not have been better shown going after the prior vp and contrasting your views directly with him basically demonstrated that ramaswamy is in pursuit of that position on the republican ticket if his goal was to impress an audience of one which i believe it was he completely succeeded and as a result won the debate hes so plainly running for vp that it should be embarrassing i wish he would just run for a train out of this country for good to call him obnoxious is a gross understatement i dont know who won but i know the six who lost at least in my mind the six raising their hands saying they would support trump if nominated even if he were convicted by a jury they are clearly not eligible for the job themselves or they dont expect to win the nomination in some are using this race as practice for next time the republican party has a history of not nominating women or people of color ask ted cruz about how the republicans had mark halporin ask their half cuban republican front runner in about what cuban food and cuban music he liked the rather heavy handed smack down of the non white guy who was a harvard law school graduate former texas ag u s senator but he wasnt white thank goodness one could only imagine what a smart person could have done in trumps place trump was only good at criminal activity so vivek nikki and tim yall might hang in there but you are going nowhere desantis is the epitome of a dumb politician so christie pence or that guy on the end mark twain easier to fool people than to convince them that they were fooled the media wants a horse race these candidates are the south end of that north bound horse truth president joe biden won the gqp debate but haley raised her hand supporting an if convicted candidate the of republican primary voters too gullible to vote likely under estimated the show was broadcast on a cable tv station of fox so it wasnt accessible to the large national population of cord cutters the rumbletv co broadcast of the show ostensibly intended to allow access to the cord cutter crowd was so intentionally enshitified a surely intentional unsync of about seconds between the visual and audio tracks it made the show practically unwatchable whats the latest proportion between these two mutually exclusive media consumption groups in the large cable tv media congromerates can still get away with cutting off the cordcutters from such real time news coverage the rnc and the dnc ought to get it together and refuse these old school media congromerates this continuing monopoly on real time news reporting haleys debate performance says a great deal about the current republican party imagine gaining attention only because you were the only candidate who was fact based and that was only some of the time more than most of them though i thought the insider take was that haley won however the main effect of this is she will get funding from the anti trump establishment up to now that has been going to desantis and scott from the point of view of the base the dial has not shifted scott is dead in the water and desantis is fading the non trump candidates are hoping trump has some health issue which takes him out short of that they are stuffed ramaswamys path is through the trump vote but only if trump drops out but like trump ramaswamy has too little support elsewhere and given his statements on climate change education funding and voting age he will mobilize an increased youth vote against him desantis is similar to ramasway vivs a vis trump and even more unlikelable with his attacks on wokeism haley can maybe get more moderates and independents but loses the trump vote as for trump with over already declaring they would never vote for him his nomination is already a loss waiting to happen conclusion no gop nominee can win because conservatism has finally reached the point where it has had to become so unhinged dishonest and dependent upon numerous small factions fascists racists fundamentalists corporate interests that are reviled by the larger remainder of the public that no amount of pr and more lies can save it from elective extinction however if they could eliminate that elective voting part of the equation then they could maybe retain power that way and that is why despite january th and all the criminal indictements conservative donors continue to support trump and the gop haley did a great job stuck to the facts attacked when needed and put the indian isolationist in his place all that was missing was her telling him to grow up if i was going to vote repub id go with haley on principal alone now here is the bad news shes a woman and nobody in the gop will vote for a woman however they will vote for a indian guy named ramaswamy because he becomes the token minority that the gop can say look we have black friends also but here is the thing ramy has already signaled his intentions he has no chance in hell of being the gop primary candidate and he know that but up on that stage he pledged his fealty to trump and trump wants a pit bull yes man thats also an minority as his vp see where this is going ramy is just wanting to be vp and use as a step stone to become potus when trump is out or dies plain and simple ramy is an isolationist national policy of avoiding political or economic entanglements with other countries ramaswamy is whatever he believes will appeal to the lowest common repug sensibilities and by extension trump he wants to be a political chameleon that never works out hes campaigning for an audience of one swamy is smarmy i think hailey was right elect a female if u want to replace bloviating with achievement haley elect her if you want a president with no spine and an opinion that changes daily depending on the wind direction its really sad that million americans think their con man actually cares about america or their own well being how do you break the cult like jim jones poison their kool aid here is my own poll from this republican presidential debate no minds no spines i agree that haley may have benefited most in the unlikely but possible event that tfg dies or is incapacitated during the primary campaign i think that haleys strength as a candidate in the general election and even in a tfg less primary has been underestimated she has mostly managed not to earn maga ire unlike pence and christie and whats left of the gop normies like her i know two time tfg voters who plan to vote for her id like to see a non fascist non maga republican even one who pretends to be a somewhat maga win the nomination for the sake of democracy in case the gop nominee wins the general but i fear that haley could win the general against biden by winning over enough independents with her feminist rhetoric softer antiabortion stance and foreign policy chops to make up for the maga and lukewarm on biden left leaning abstainers and i want biden to win i think that tfg as nominee would motivate dems and indies to vote in greater numbers and elect biden but i dont want to hope that tfg wins the nomination because shame on me and what if biden is incapacitated and tfg wins the general against harris so im doing the rbg dance on eggshells hoping biden remains viable and wins and hoping for a blue tsunami in congress vote and hoping for a blue tsunami in congress vote we need to get more people registered and then get them activated the biggest gap between eligible and registered voters in in gen z one thing that gives me hope is that the gop has landed on the wrong side of every issue that concerns gen z reproductive rights climate change gun violence the culture war attacks on woke

change gun violence prevention if you are passionate about one of these topics please write some letters for these va campaigns donald trump is the clear front runner ahead of the primaries but he didnt participate in the debate not true trump zoomed his lies from tucker carlsons stage while the gop told their lies on the debate stage the entire mess was a sick joke none of these pathetic excuses for human beings come anywhere near being qualified for anything but chief dogcatcher and probably not even that ramaswamy is a fake and a phony who doesnt believe any of the bs he spouts and defacist is so awkward its incredibly painful to even watch him and the embarrassing fake forced facial expressions he attempts fox propaganda obviously stacked the audience with pro trump the traitor people who booed on cue every time they heard anything anti trump one thing they all share is cowardice in spades the entire mess was a sick joke none of these pathetic excuses for human beings come anywhere near being qualified for anything but chief dogcatcher and probably not even that i thought the lincoln projects forecast for the debate hit on a lot of the deficiencies in the candidates jv https www youtube com watch v xjbjqxdutyg and note the title of this piece jv for junior varsity im waiting for someone to look at ramaswamy and ask this one salient question you are a vociferous support of trump so why are you running against him id love to hear his response which likely will be fantastically convoluted he thinks trump might have to drop out of the race and vivek wants to inherit trumps support its not a bad play republicans are going to sour on trump hes a moldy oldy trumps like a tv show that dragged on for too many seasons and he never stops complaining if trump was like your butcher youd start going to another shop trumps voters will break hard for the new guy ramaswany of all the candidates on stage weds he was the only one who matched if not exceeded trumps energy and his instincts for chaotic disruption you say he has no idea what hes talking about since when has that mattered to republicans not since sarah palin republican voters are only interested in being entertained and owning the libs see plus he promised to pardon trump unconditionally fearless prediction ramaswamy will win the nomination if you possibly thing that the racists known as republicans nowadays are going to vote for a president ramaswamy youre out of your mind assuming all are republicans racist is a huge miscalculation that could cost the dems votes the conservatives main motivating principle is hatred of classical liberalism and the world its created a patriarchal autocracy is their goal they thnk its the best way to insure individual liberty theyll accept support from anybody ramaswamy got the loudest longest cheers wednesday at a republican debate who do you think was cheering for him you can get excellent odds on that at an off shore betting site try paddy power why in the world do iowa republicans think being for putin and being against nato is being for america im not sure even the disinformation agents who will troll me will know but someone higher up in the ranks probably does putin runs their country the way they want america run i heard a comment from an iowa republican about the debate we love whoever the democrats hate that is the gift of rupert murdoch vladimir putin and the right wing plutocracy and none of this will mean a darn thing in the contest for the nomination haley would have been smart to moderate on transgenderism too that was a harsh note that could turn off potential supporters twenty nine percent of republican primary voters who watched wednesdays debate said that florida gov ron desantis won horse poop more like had made up their minds ahead of time and refused to change their minds despite desantis disappearing is it really that big of a surprise anyone who thinks ron desantis would make a good president is just as delusional as those that look at the time indicted unstable dunce iow exact opposite of stable genius and think i want more years of that maybe they liked him because he seemed so angry and yelled a lot maybe they just like fascists desantis won easily he doesnt need to be showy hes running on his proven track record enough said yep teachers leaving in droves spending millions of tax dollars fighting disney the largest employer in the state banning books denying the realities of covid hiring scientists who might as well be tarot card readers yeah what a record nothing in his record i could support teacher bashing rights for lgbtq us citizens attacked book banning firing public servants from the opposition party hes less than worthless going after disney disney all yours if thats what florida wants i hope your state disappears under water sooner rather than later wishing a place harm is a pretty awful thing to say won what second place in the awkward contest his proven track record is called fascism and he makes as good a nazi as hitler himself invading mexico really thats an act of war and quite frankly desantis knows it because he was taught if not in law school than in naval justice school that we dont invade other countries without significant repercussions and mexico is our number one trading partner desantis was playing maga giving raw meat to anyone who wants to dispense of rule of law whether its the law among nations and guess what our constitution states that treaties are the supreme law of the land or any legal principle that desantis doesnt want to follow desantis looses in court trump went first the illegal instigator desantis is trying to ride trumps boot straps even while trump is kicking him but trump is soon to meet lady justice face to face and his mug shot is quite revealing he is not in control while desantis is still scrapping at lady liberty its not going to bode well with either because most americans have wised up to both of them slitting throats shooting people stone dead like in the philippines no permits for guns going after prosecutors you dont agree with dismantling a highly intellectual school and making it a low grade baseball school banning abortion before a woman knows she is pregnant going after disney banning books changing real history to your fake version of it i could go on and on this man should never become our president this man should be in any elected office hahaha that proven track record of government overreach book banning and violations of free speech certainly makes an impression i just wonder how many people actually watched this garbage the other night i sure didnt does anyone know what the ratings were without his orange fraudulency on board only someone who lacks at least two brain cells synapsing would vote for anyone who says that climate change is a hoax and that there were federal law enforcement officers involved in then again those same magats are not voting for someones whose last name they cant pronounce not right but true all the same then again those same magats are not voting for someones whose last name they cant pronounce lets get real the magats wouldnt vote for him nikki haley or tim scott because of the color of their skin racism isnt a bug it is a feature for the gop especially the current virulent white nationalist that is dominant now they voted for herschel walker he was running against a black democrat plus he garnered over k fewer votes than brian kemp did in his race for governor for q ron they must have been watching something else on tv im all for this primary circus it assures no one electable is going to make the general its going to take a lot more of trumps version of winning know as losing in conventional circles to convince of the country that they are never going to succeed acting like toddlers our weekly discussion thread can be found here https www reddit com r games comments jul k weekly rgames discussion what have you been is there a way to get rid of the card popups from the bottom menu on ps my seriesx has exclusively became a tetris connected machine theres a bunch of stuff i wanna play but i cant stop playing tetris lol is demon souls replayable im trying to justify spending tax on it or just rent the game for a weekend yes and no theres the option to go through the game again doing different builds and weapons and playstyles invading and co oping with other players but the game is always the same ng doesnt give you any new content just makes things more difficult so if youre a see all the content type of player then no its not very replayable multiplayer invading and co op gave me most of my longevity when playing souls games i think so but it depends on how much you like to try different builds you cant respec and there are a fair few different ways to play theres also a fair bit of easily misable content you might want to discover world tendency for example isnt well explained and can lock you out of some specific high end weapons spells and the encounters all souls games have new game new games but your generally just replaying the same content with higher damage numbers and narrower room for error many people adore multiplayer dueling and can do that for a thousand hours but thats player specific content wise there isnt that much content i finally managed to order a ps during the latest walmart shipment says itll arrive by december nd but well see if my order gets cancelled or delayed or something before then my ps preorder from target still hasnt shipped ive called target too many times i want to explode please dont be rude to the cashiers managers at your local stores who happen to get some consoles i work nights at a walmart and we have already got complaints from a couple people wanting an xbox this store opens at am now due to covid but tuesday is our senior day and opens at am for them someone seriously complained about the seniors skipping ahead in line granny just want to pwn some n bs im just glad im at an age where i was able to fully appreciate the console evolution for playstation and its contemporaries since the very beginning videogames are s huge part of my life and have always welcomed me when i felt lonely so im thankful i was born at such a time where i could and can get the most of it heres to an exciting future so excited for thursday miles morales is calling my name i got three games pre ordered spiderman demon souls and assassins creed not sure which to play first but think i am doing spiderman will likely play astro bot before anything to check out those dualsense features for those of us who werent able to preorder for whatever reason were not going to be able to get either console for a while arent we if you frequently check online retailers and your local stores you will probably have success in finding one but with the seeming high demand and low initial stock for all the new systems they probably wont be readily available until early next year in an ideal world this is how ordering a highly in demand new product would work everybody who wants product has a full week to sign up and give manufacturer or reseller price manufacturer or reseller takes the list of people who have given them money so far and shuffles it they let you know your place in line and approximate worst case delivery date and if you dont want to let them hold your money for that long you can get a refund and walk away thereafter anybody who wants to can pay price to join the queue this is the most scalper resistant system possible because it forces them to put down money up front for every order with no guarantee that theyll be first in line it saves people the stress of f ing a busted ass walmart amazon target page only to come away empty handed allowing a full week of signups before determining order is fair to people with all sorts of different schedules and doesnt reward people with bots who can snipe first come first serve orders the fastest happy first day of the th generation of video games everyone it will be interesting to see if there are any major gameplay changes that new technologies make possible bought p royal even though p is free in the ps collection because everyone keeps saying that its worth the extra yall better be right it seems like people who had their xbox shipped from the amazon warehouse in macon ga arent getting theirs today me and several others have their ups status stuck in on its way to ups its anecdotal but heres a couple of threads https www reddit com r xboxseriesx comments jrszv anyone else ordered from amazon and got https reddit com r xboxseriesx comments jrmpcu amazon shipping gbu ag https twitter com harper status serious question is it worth getting an xbox series x just so i can play my old games on a platform that doesnt take half an hour to open a game obviously ill get games down the line but there are no xbox exclusives that interest me at the moment if you do decide to get it and only have games id highly recommend checking out game pass hundreds of games you can download and play if you can afford it then yeah im thinking about getting an s just for old games saw it on walmart added to cart hit checkout website gets hung on refresh for a minute errors out and then its sold out and added to save for later welp i tried its impossible to buy a ps online today unless youre using bots yourself im sorry its just the reality seeing how the xbox release is going pre orders being delayed amazon purchases being cancelled gamestop and units being sold out after a couple minutes of being available im just going to be patient and wait till next year same here except with the ps it really doesnt even seem all that worth it getting a ps or xbox series x s rn anyways theres no exclusive games which spider man miles morales was one of the reasons why i wanted to get a ps but then they said it was gonna be on ps too but man getting any of those consoles is such a big hassle and these companies have been handling it so badly just gonna wait to get one when god of war ragnorak and gotham knights come out otherwise ps and pc will definitely do for now waited for over an hour in the queue on the sony site got it in the cart then was told shortly after that it was expired and that i had to delete it from my cart before continuing now it says out of stock im heartbroken right now for real though demons souls is probably the best looking game ive ever played and it doesnt even run in k that just makes me think k is unnecessary p with upscaling techniques is far more than good enough and you can push higher framerates k has always felt like a weird priority it can sometimes offer noticeable benefits on large tvs but more often that not better results would come from devoting system resources toward improved lighting raytracing and art design i agree that p is plenty good for almost all circumstances and i wish thats what the tv manufacturers had been targeting all this time whats the point of putting a ps into your walmart cart if they just keep getting errors and refreshes later it goes out of stock i dont understand how bots are able to order shit when the website literally doesnt work walmart opened their xbox online orders at pm the very second it turned over i added it to my cart and by the time i got to the end of checkout they were sold out a matter of like seconds that sounds shady as fuck how does that even happen my walmart gave employees dibs before the general public i waited in line hours doors open and all were sold out i mean really gtfoh this is fucking ridiculous the literal second it went from to walmart seized up and became unresponsive even though i was already on the page just refreshing after a minute or so of errors and sorry s it came back and the ps s were gone this shit is why people will pay grand for one of these things i got to see a dualsense in action recently and its really a game changer as far as standard controllers go when you fire an automatic rifle the trigger actually pushes your finger back halfway through the trigger press after each round fired its crazy actually fucking shameful walmart adds stock to its website website gets flooded by bots to the point that the website stops loading and is unusable stock is soldout such unbelievably shitty behaviors retailers need regulatory oversight to mandate bot protection and scalping of physical goods needs to be illegal im hoping to snag a ps at target on thursday but im pretty anxious about it since they have consoles in store for pickup i think thats my best chance id love to play demon souls before next year my ps hard froze launching demons souls for the first time it froze for a few seconds during the intro movie desyncing the audio and video and making the controller unresponsive after the intro movie ended it just stayed at a black screen had to hold in the power button for seconds after that it downloaded a patch for ds and i havent had it happen since i think the system is going to have to do what the ps did and suggest you allow patches to finish downloading and installing before launching software theres a guy on twitter called wario who meticulously posts when the next gen consoles pop up for sale hes super quick about it that was the only way i was able to get a preorder in time if youre having trouble finding them try following him well after failing times to get a ps time to just wait i guess this was a good thing for demon souls is pretty steep ill hold out tell buying isnt constantly refreshing stock it still amazes me how retailers have no nothing to combat bots ps was in stock on amazon every time i hit add to cart it would say it was empty reload the page hit add to cart still empty cart for mins over and over till it was out of stock im so tired of scalpers on every product that can be resold i wish there was just some way to stop the botting and let actual people buy what they wanted what incentive do retailers have to combat bots bots or real their product stock gets sold out instantly these retailers are not in the business of making things fair theyre in the business of moving product and business is booming its kind of surprising how visually underwhelming the opening cinematics are in demon souls compared to just how damn beautiful the game itself is will there be an additional launch thread for ps releasing in other countries next week got to the store early here in japan to snag a ps only to find out that you can only reserve one to purchase by raffle for the foreseeable future fuck scalpers are having a field day fck you walmart i got to the last page to place order but then you hit me with captchas that fcked me over daily fuck you to walmart because you make me play the stupid recaptcha game for min get it in my cart and then the checkout button doesnt work walmart sold out within seconds as well guess ill try again for ps s tomorrow thursday but overall extremely disappointed that retailers didnt provide stronger protection against bots why was the issues thread removed i think its because some of the issues were found to be fake target fucking sucks i preordered on sept th in the first wave and it still stuck on preparing to ship how has every other retailer done this so much better lol walmart sold out almost instantly tried adding to cart got an error about times then it said to keep your account safe click the box below and there was no box this is what happens when theres no regulation to protect consumers none of these retailers have bot protections in place theres no laws against scalping of physical goods and the result is websites flooded by bots and scalpers selling those bot bought consoles for k personally i like console wars as it creates a competitive market i dont like fanboyism both consoles seem to be neck and neck in performance ps getting advantage right now due to its lineup anyone know if walmart cancelled the spiderman orders mines still says pending is any reason i should get a series x s if i already have gamepass on pc it seems all the big xbox releases are also going to be on pc so if i can save some money by skipping out on xbox and just getting a ps this gen that would be great there are a ton of games available on game pass console that arent available on pc i bought a cheap xbone one s so i could play all the gears games nier and a few others that arent on game pass pc im probably going to get a series s later on when theyre in stock to replace my xbone thats what i did high end pc ps is a good combo redditdetector theres a list here of gamepass games on pc and those on console console has games while pc has some that are only on the console gamepass are on pc like planet coaster or the ea games but are just not on gamepass for pc not all of the pc ones are on xbox either so theres more console only ones than the difference in number between the two while the big name xbox titles tend to be on both there are a lot of highly rated games on the console only gamepass i live in australia i preordered the ps from eb games and got the release day shipment but theres days til release and ive not heard anything about my console being shipped off yet does anyone have any information about this is it still likely that ill have it by thursday or should i just stop holding my breath for that hahahah you shou ordered from bestbuy a ps for delivery hoping i get a shipment notification asap take my money damn it oh boy the console wars crowd are really flaring up with the launch so close someone blocked me because i corrected them in their claim the ps cant play games at k nor can they reach fps this may only help west coasters but my local gamestop opened at am and had a few non preorder units in stock i think only catch was that people who didnt preorder were forced to get a bundle with the protection only catch was that people who didnt preorder were forced to get a bundle with the protection i like how youre acting like thats just a minor thing and not a complete dealbreaker to most sane people guarantee that was employees trying to increase their attach numbers wtf is that shit i thought this was illegal during past launches so a tax to buy it first man some people are crazy is there a way to actually order one of these damn things no one has had a preorder now option open for months welp was refreshing the target page for local pickup came in stock at am with left immediately added to cart tried to check out got stuck at the final step wouldnt load the next page refresh item out of stock gg wp just happened again only on best buy aaaaand again on walmart had it in my cart was literally waiting for the place order page to load and it booted me out saying theyre out of stock honestly this is fucking ridiculous it must be bots i have no idea how else they could sell their entire stock in under seconds we should fully expect the reseller market to continue until you can buy these in stores with ease stockx has listings for all consoles ps disc version currently selling at around dozens and dozens of sales today its easy money for these people same as sneakers what a joke walmart com is horrible the first time it made me re enter my credit card info when it was added a week ago the second and third time my delivery address disappeared and i had to re enter that by that time they are all gone are they screwing with peoples login info as someone who only had a ps for about a year after launch but also has a decent gaming pc ps is the obvious choice right with the ps collection other ps games ive missed i should be looking at a big library yup and if xbox ever delivers a great exclusive you have game pass pc since persona is apart of the ps collection i am tempted to go back to it and get the platinum trophy since i got the platinum for royal earlier this year gonna miss all of the qol changes and sumi from royal though did anyone manage to get one from walmart i got to the cart put in my info had to click submit multiple times due to errors happening and then it said sold out why it didnt reserve a stock for me when i put it in my cart i do not know so i didnt pre order one in canada i put my name on a first to know list at my local eb games like a week ago i didnt know that they were doing launch day online only so after work today i went to my local walmart to see what the scoop was no consoles went to eb no consoles i come home kinda sad pissed off because i know that bots likely bought all the consoles sit down at my computer start redditing my phone rings its eb games wtf i pick up congratulations youre on our first to know list and were letting you know you can pick up a playstation console tomorrow what the fuck people pre ordered legitimately and have to wait until next week i randomly put my name on a first to know list a week ago and i get my console tomorrow not a gloat post at all i just cant really believe my luck im speechless got my ps today and wow it is amazing coming from xbox which wasnt used much as a single player gamer i felt like a kid again booting it up and playing astro the controller is excellent and the value from ps plus is phenomenal happy i went with sony this gen some people have reported their series x failling doesnt seem to be widespread but worth keeping an eye on https twitter com roninstrife status https twitter com kaj maru status https twitter com gilicohdv status some of those videos are provably fake as you can see mentioned in the replies stuff like being originally posted in august or from people who publicly stated they werent buying the series x etc not saying there arent failures as is the case with electronics in general but that these videos are to likely be taken with a grain of salt his first comment after it happens is a nonchalant you wonder why playstationn sells more and his account going back weeks is super toxic im betting fake maybe someone on the back unplugging the console or something wouldnt be a console launch without a viral video of someones console exploding nowinstock net has been a poor choice for ps alerts half the time i dont hear an alert and when i do the product is out of stock by that time is there an alternative as much as i hate still using aa batteries that dual sense runs out of power pretty damn quick its a really cool controller but its pretty frustrating it might be because you were playing astro bot that your controller was dying quick because it is constantly using all of the built in features i felt mine lasted quite a long time while playing spiderman best chance for a launch console still needs sites any stores anything thanks in the us youll want to check online with target walmart and maybe best buy or amazon at midnight one tiny thing im loving about quick resume is that i can sneak in minutes of gaming before my carpool arrives because it literally takes seconds or less to start playing from the console being off review of xbox series x controller is slightly improved grip dpad feels good console is extremely painless to setup probably the easiest ive ever done load times are drastically improved across the board and fps is much improved on games like halo anniversary graphics for k went from ish to a constant quick resume is dope easily switch between up to games wherever youre at in them and it even carries over through a hard reset not many series x optimized games yet but the ones that are like ori look absolutely incredible k supersampled down to k fps stunningly gorgeous the auto hdr on old games is really cool too along with their k ai upscaling old games look better than ever im planning to play through psychonauts on it as well as black maybe one of the fables overall not a must buy for any new gen games obviously since they committed to keep releasing for the old consoles for at least a year but if youre looking for improved performance load times interested in backwards compatible game upgrades and want to utilize quick resume to save time it does all that very well if you have a k tv but still the original xbox one its absolutely the time to upgrade and with game pass acquiring ea play this week combined with the backwards compatibility provides a deceivingly huge launch lineup of older games not disappointed at all in my purchase looks like i wont be able to get one until april that sucks pretty bad https www gamespot com articles xbox series x s supply shortages expected to last for months id consider being an early adopter of a ps but i just think how the games i want are may as well wait months to a year and grab second hand copies for with possibly a couple more exclusive games is there a wired version of the xbox controller looking to use it for pc but my pc does not have bluetooth i believe you can plug in any of the xbox series controllers via usb c if youre looking for one thats only wired i dont think ms has made one since the days just plug a usb c cable into a normal xbox series controller bt doesnt work for it right now anyway you can buy a little wireless connector thats what i use plugs into usb real talk all the articles about peoples dead xboxs and shit are the dumbest things ive ever seen in my life in what world do of a hardware software products units work all the time what a shit post way to try and get bait views contact the company get a refund send the xbox in and move on like everyone else if i wrote to news articles every time i bought a new stick of memory or any sort of pc hardware that just wasnt working id be insta famous i feel like you werent around during the red ring of death this is how it started so thats it walmart was our last hope of getting a ps on the topic of scalping i wonder if it would be possible for the major re seller venues like ebay and amazon and that sort of thing to agree that in the interests of consumers they would have a moratorium on selling any used major consumer electronics within say months of its launch that means no ps s no gtx s etc this wouldnt harm legitimate used product sellers since they shouldnt be done with it that quickly anyway but it would be a strong disincentive against resellers since product supply chains could likely reach actual customers by then sure there would always be shady black market places people could find these things but this should still sweep a lot of potential customers off the table making scalping much less profitable that would require them to be moral companies remember corporations are considered people but they are not held to such standard they get a of the sale so a move like this would certainly be pro consumer but bad for business people want to part with their money for double the price of retail ebay gets twice the profit they become a second reseller in this and they literally dont have to do anything the losers are the actual consumer and dont expect morals when there is money to be made sony gets paid resellers get paid ebay gets paid theres no problem in their eyes the ps has some shitty bugs man like right now i cant launch demons souls like it just wont start other games no problem but demons souls doesnt work anymore had no problems all week until now if anyone hasnt gotten a chance to preorder may i suggest using nowinstock net if you want to buy one on launch day you can sign up for notifications or follow the chat which is usually really helpful congrats to xbox and playstation gamers both consoles are looking pretty sweet after seeing the xbox series x quick resume in action i really really want one for my living room eventually so ive been out of the loop for a while but are there like no new games that arent cross gen no truly next gen only exclusives to show off the new hardware i swear it feels like the first time this has ever happened and im really saddened to hear it new consoles used to mean new games demons souls is the big one miles morales is excellent and astros playroom is really cool and shows off how great the dualsense controller is the demons souls remake is apparently also great but granted thats not truly a new game reading all these comments makes me feel really lucky to have been able to preorder before they sold out at my local gamestop i hope everyone can get one soon this has been a real shit show can someone tell me whether sackboy gets good in the way that mario games get good later on i already have it and im going to play it either way but i want to avoid going in with the wrong expectations and come away disappointing i dont expect it to be as good as mario d world but im hoping for some more interesting challenges later on than what ive seen in videos of the early game anyone know how quick resume works with physical games on xbox can i suspend a game remove the disc put it back in later and pick up where i left off saudi officials are killing hundreds of women and children out of view of the rest of the world while they spend billions on sports washing to try to improve their image fuck me that was grim reading thats why i think we should ignore saudi league alltogether here because it is not about football it is about sports washing a year old boy said border guards forced him and other survivors to rape two girl survivors after the guards had executed another migrant who refused to rape another survivor all described scenes of horror women men and childrens bodies strewn across the mountainous landscape severely injured already dead and dismembered first i was eating with people and then they were dying said one person there are some people who you cannot identify because their bodies are thrown everywhere some people were torn in half jesus fucking christ this is one of the worst things i have read they do this shit and then pretend to be some sort of godly nation hypocritical pricks i mean anyone with half an education knows what theyre doing and doesnt support it the problem is most of the world is ignorant to this stuff and doesnt care to learn anything theyre not ignorant to it they just care more about money the more we support fan owned clubs the better things will be for the future of football i think the prem is too balls deep in dirty money at this point eddie howe i havent really given it too much thought and when you ask newcastle fans its just a shrug of the shoulders from them since the greenwood and saudi incident i have lost lot of faith among football fans things i saw on twitter regarding greenwood saudi takeover qatar united takeover is absolutely grim they are not even hiding it anymore i saw an edit of homelander quotes you need me dialogue painted in positive way for greenwood which had k likes what the fuck are we living in dystopia or what i am sympathetic to a lot of our fans who say theyre tired of the partisan jibes and that theyre just supporting our club like they always have that were not unique in that respect and i agree that doing so does not make us as fans complicit in the crimes of the saudis anymore than man utd fans would be answerable for mason greenwood or the duplicity of their board but the collective indifference of a lot of fans has been really depressing to witness like yes we arent answerable for the saudi regime but fuck me we could at least do something protest outside the saudi arabia friendlies being held at st james a wor flags display commemorating some of the victims of the saudis anything to register that we dont like our club being the plaything of a brutal petro state each and every single person who has hand waved away the fact that saudi arabia and qatar are using sports to launder their image should be forced to read this article daily this should be posted on all the highlights and transfer rumors for the saudi league its sad how little people give a shit about newcastle being saudi owned especially since the greenwood stuff shows it is possible for the public to gather together and oppose immoral behaviours by a football club hearing people talk about how well theyre running the club and that theyre doing well without even spending that much yet is actually sickening and just shows how full of shit so many people are with their selective moral outrage especially since the greenwood stuff shows it is possible for the public to gather together and oppose immoral behaviours by a football club i am always astonished how little pl fans trust the power of concentrated and proper outrage in germany fans are climbing fences when you raise standing tickets above or play monday games and thats why these ideas are quickly thrown out the window and the french are fucking world champs at any protest with greenwood it showed that something can be made happen when enough people do care but in most cases its just a resounding meh wouldnt change anything anyway and anyone whos invested in a cause is laughed at meanwhile in newcastle oh no but women can drive now attitudes towards women are improving according to the cuntish shills on here as they still kill and multilate and oppress them regularly fucking wank stains seriously fuck any of these money grabbing cunts who went and played or managed over there to legitimise this regime theyve actively exposed themselves as terrible human beings for me and if henderson ever plays for england again then its a sackable offence i know newcastle fans will come into a lot of stick for their behaviour but it isnt their fault that the club theyve supported all their life now lies in the hand of a murderous state the entire blame rests on the premier league and ultimately the government deals like this should never be sanctioned countries with such awful human rights records shouldnt be courted by western diplomats and we certainly shouldnt be selling them arms and weapons like in the uk and i imagine the us too people are all over this thread calling out newcastle fans theyre just working class football fans for the most part who have had their club taken the real problem is a government that would allow our game be turned into a plaything of murderous states theyre the only ones with power in this scenario newcastle fans should be more vocal about saudi arabia actions because they need to see that sportwashing doesnt work even to people who support your club greenwood saga gave me confidence that people care more about morals than football so i really hope we will see some protest against saudi before or during newcastle games its a no win situation i havent given a penny to the club since the takeover and i dont plan to but you get people on both sides going at you for either being a virtue signaller trying to bring newcastle united down or a genocide enabler when the takeover went through i would talk about my unease but it always just ends up in shit flinging from all sides so i just end up keeping my feelings to myself most of the time i am and get downvoted for being a hypocrite and sent awful dms from fans of other clubs calling me a murderer for having a newcastle flair genuinely cant win as everyone assumes im in favour of the takeover from the flair alone but but generation wealth they have the right to get the bag kings you would do the same the dumb fucks that spam shit like that on every saudi post should be tied to a chair and forced to read and see atrocities that those monsters commit gotta secure that wealth so their great great great great grandson can own a private jet without working a day in his life makes you want to hate the sport you love support local lower league if you can where community still matters the likes of ronaldo and co that decide to go play out there are pretty despicable no way they dont know what saudi is about yet they decide to go there for all that money i couldnt give a shit what ronaldo donates to charity hes just as bad messi is also a saudi ambassador you hate him too you know i would agree with you if you didnt only target the saudis we gonna criticise beckham or any other player who goes to the us with their massive amount of war crimes in iraq and afghanistan this energy is always only directed at players going to saudi absolutely awful apart from boycotting sjp refusing to buy the shiny new adidas shirt and being vocal about how much i hate the saudis what else can i do nothing in the uk by an individual or small group of individuals will impact saudi policy internally or externally yeah the people shitting on newcastle fans are virtue signaling cunts genuinely think theyre better than you cuz they dont support newcastle as if u had any sort of control in the matter the uk government sells weapons to the saudis the fa and epl allowed them to buy your club the media looks the other way to what theyre doing its not right that you feel like youre the one letting newcastle down come on now what did sarah jessica parker do this time one million iraqis dead and no one in this sub said anything about the morals of messis move to the mls before you downvote me explain to me why they deserved to die the mls isnt owned by the government that committed such atrocities stop with the whataboutism im pretty sure if someone from bidens cabinet was spearheading the mls project people would lose their heads too youre the one who needs to explain why you think the mls killed one million iraqis because the us government dont own inter miami its got absolutely nothing to do with the geographical location of the league its because the people committing war crimes funding terrorists and torturing journalists are the same people who own newcastle and a couple of the saudi teams its not hard to understand they dont they fail to forget saudi arabia learnt sports washing with their american buddies no need to go to iraq or even to the past any saudi atrocities in yemen has usa and the whole west hands on it as well why people here pretending that saudi arabia is a pariah state that works alone theres also the undercovered aspect that the us military has provided funding weapons and training to the saudi border security https open substack com pub thecolumn p biden administration funding and r c i utm medium ios utm campaign post the us has better pr the us govt doesnt own mls clubs mls is not being used to make the us govt look good in front of the world if you want to use messi as an example hes taking saudi money to promote their world cup bid against argentina uruguays bid just posted a very similar comment big ups to you for recognising both sides of the issue people wanna shout whataboutism dont even know what that means lol btw im from india so lest we forget the crimes of the uk monarchs themselves if not the pioneers they definitely perfected the guidebook on pillaging messi being a piece of shit doesnt mean saudi arabia isnt a piece of shit nobody needs to explain anything to you you need to be less stupid https en wikipedia org wiki slavery in saudi arabia then explain to me why saudi arabia was the center of slave trade what did the sudanese and ethiopians for example do to the arabs to deserve this or the circassian or georgian or syrian or indian women ho had to work as sex slaves in the harems the united states has killed hundreds of thousands of people funny how sports washing is never used in that context because the us government dont own the sports teams dumbass so its got nothing to do with them the saudis that kill innocent people are the same ones paying ronaldos wages or buying players for newcastle they didnt sport washed their actions theyve democracy washed them lol saudi arabia is really bad but the united states are even worse i see they are not just trying to kill football fucking gross if true it is absolutley horrendous and should be condemed by every means possible however the only real evidence if anyone bothered to read the article is eye witness testimony that being said i absolutley dont doubt that terrible things happened in that region the saudi yameni boarder is a lawless place and technically still a war zone being a migrant alone makes one in an extermely vulnerable position now imagine that in a war zone that being said lets all now witness the backwards logic of the idea of sportswashing bringing a country in the spotlight does not rinse its image it just highlights its imperfections and flaws now should this sub be turned into a a place where we post about countries boarder agencies foreign policy and domestic politics should we post about migrants drawing in the sea due trying to reach europe should we post about the spanish wolfpack rape case what about israeli apartheid anytime an israeli player and team is in the news no one is pretending saudi is perfect but i dont see anyone critiquing the tory party everytime the pl is posted here or bolsonaros treating of the amazon when he was president when posting a flamengo goal or the us drone attack that killed afghani civillians or the the video that julian assange leaked and made him a target by the us and uk governaments this is such a huge false equivalence its crazy the reason we dont talk about israeli players the tory party atrocities that happen in spain migrants dying trying to enter europe is because the israeli government dont own newcastle the tory party dont own multiple clubs in a league they are buying world famous player to play in purely to sportswash the owners of crystal palace didnt brutally mutilate and torture a journalist the galzers arent currently at war with yemen and killing children daily the second the state of israel own a football team in the prem then we will talk about it israeli apartheid on r soccer rather than political subs and as much as i fucking hate the tories youd either be unbelievably stupid or deliberately mislead to even try to say theyre even slightly as bad as the saudi royal family last i checked sunak didnt torture someone because they spoke out against him bro dont waste your time this is the exact type of racism we should fight against but media tells us racism is a lot more simple than that and is actually more about catching someone slipping and uttering a single word rather than confronting everyones own little biases just a reminder women players successfully revolted against having a visit saudi sleeve ad for the world cup when players stand up united against something they can enact change so why is it necessary to type women and children when they are killing everyone invokes a deeper emotional response from the reader sales this is what happens when people know there are literally no consequences to their actions when you can do anything you want to another person and you are risking absolutely nothing this is what raw humanity is when stripped of its laws respect or empathy its very sad that there are people having to experience this while the rich continue to get richer by showing support to the people responsible for it i see a lot of comments criticising newcastle fans for just blindly supporting their club and not speaking out but wtf are the rest of you doing other than complaining on here you see so many rivals fans being vocal about this stuff in these threads but you never take it any further why arent you protesting why arent you setting an example you never see anything at premier league games youre all talk and just as much to blame for letting it happen as everyone else its almost like youll just use it as attack ammo and then just conveniently forget about it and move on with your lives once you leave the thread if fans of teams like arsenal actually gave a shit about this stuff theyd be protesting their kit and stadium sponsor but they dont at least bayern did they just walk around with it proudly on their chest while criticising others look what kind of abuse you get for calling out others for not doing anything either you supporters of state owned sportswashing clubs have to stick together i see no one should be surprised about this also dont forget about their war in yemen its easy to forget about that since its been going on for so long okay i dont watch newcastle games what is there to do well i suppose newcastle fans could have started with not wearing towels on their head and cheering in the streets when they were bought out the the saudis beyond that protest about as much as the rest of us can do the saudi regime is undoubtedly one of the worst on the planet but theyre a key strategic ally of the majority of the world powers so theyll continue to be supplied with weapons and a blind eye will be turned to each and every action of theirs be vocal europe needs energy oil and gas from saudi middle east especially after ukraine russia war breakdown of relationship between europe west and iran while venezuela still heavily being sanctions the west also needs the saudis to be on their side especially in these multi polar world with china increasingly becoming a threat china russia military alliances more and more countries especially in africa abandoning democracies leaning more toward russia and china saudis as a strategic western allies have become a lot more important compare to years ago in addition the west lost the war in afghanistan the taliban victory conquering afghanistan have further decrease the western influence in that part of the world middle east central asia south asia region therefore the saudis and middle east countries importance to the west is right now at all time high geopolitics economy and security are the most important aspect for the western countries human women lgbt rights doesnt worth shit and would be thrown into the trash bin the west needs middle eastern countries more than ever so they would entertain and humor saudis as much as their can enabling the saudis to sports wash their country is just a small concession to make from the west in term of the bigger picture no matter how much you scream complain there is nothing you can do to stop it waiting for messi to hit us with another visit saudi post messi is an ambassador of saudi arabia remember one thing if were talking about sports washing saudi arabia are rookies in comparison to the usa as theyve done it for decades how did they learn to do it ill be glad to hear someone saying otherwise saudi officials are killing hundreds of people while doing big business with the usa uk and the eu you cannot lay the moral guilt of this on football fans if you critique this horrible act do not allow apologist of the saudi government to bully you out of the argument by them saying well you know the west fill in the blank with a western country and some previous heinous act we can be both people who condemn previous and current crimes the genocide in yemen is supported by the uk and us btw why are they signalling out the women and children men are also getting killed men also need to be seen as victims just say people next time way too many people will ignore this and then act confused why others dont want the money of the saudi government changing this sport in their favor im so tired of europeans indirectly supporting this backwards monarchy and its attempt to shift to tourism in order to survive its long overdue end that would come with the transition to renewable energy the only thing these monarchs have going for them is that they basically bribe their population into obedience why i want the west to push harder for green energy save the planet fuck the saudis but theyre a us friendly oil rich country so its ok right s unfortunately the footballing world has laid out the red carpet for saudi teams to join the ucl it is going to happen in the coming years they will be invited who will suffer from it the smaller european leagues who will have to make way for the money its a collective disgrace the players that not only fill their pockets there but promote the league also the clubs that pay no mind to play a super cup in saudi arabia and get sponsored from there i e the new spanish super cup and the leagues visit saudi that allow these investors to use football clubs as their sports washing machine of course the federations fifa and uefa everything for the sake of money football will still be football elite professional football not so much just a way for rich owners to keep on being rich and make sure the money doesnt trickle down to other clubs i wish r soccer keep the same energy about america killing thousands of people worldwide every year literally every big powerful country is killing innocent people everywhere including countries of top league disgusting country yet again this is why no one should take this league seriously outside of local supporters its not about the clubs or the players this is what matters ban the saudi league from this sub but they signed tonali horrific reading same old in the comments where all the blame is on the newcastle fans as if we ourselves got the saudis in and apparently never criticise the regime at all if only we were as righteous as the reddit user who would definitely stop supporting their club instantly and not just morally posture and enjoy the reddit karma using weapons theyve bought from the us im assuming are sports teams the only ones that need to stay away from saudis what about countries selling them arms and allowing saudis to invest and profit in their countries these actions directly facilitate fund human right abuse and violence keeping them only from sports teams hardly means anything wish papers go hard on govts facilitating all this papers have no spine to criticize the govts so they go after soft targets like sports teams imagine whats going to happen if climate change forces this kind of migration onto of the worlds population itt europeans who are fine with a policy of actively drowning migrants at sea shocked just shocked to see migrants mistreated your crocodile tears are just too much same with my fellow americans even biden has a criminal policy vs migrants sports washing works ask a geordie horrible but lets be honest nobody really cares who has the power to do anything about it china has been doing horrible stuff to the uighurs for years and despite something of a hue and cry nobody really did anything of significance to stop it western hyprocrites will criticize this but then go and kill hundreds of people in counterstrike thank god that america germany england and rest of the global elite dont kill and never didnt kill and nevermind what they did in yemen oh wait the west was giving them weapons and intel the entire time ah well somehow not as bad as abusing one person dont get me wrong both are terrible but one is magnitudes worse like the usa china russia europ have been doing and still doing the exact same thing ohhh hypocrisy of the west looove me some of that yeah the usa does the exact same thing america killed millions in iraq bombed millions in syria and other countries and continues its terrorism yet i dont see people ignoring mls or having the same energy towards mls i know wrongs dont make a right but why the hypocrisy the rape cases and a lot of the stuff in the article is pretty heinous but you realize america lied to the public that saddam had weapons of mass destruction then spent years destroying iraq afghanistan and now syria on a war that cost americans trillion dollars the deaths of military children who fought in these regions and countless local citizen lives just to hand it right back to the taliban and formally declaring a banking blackout and causing a current massive famine the only people by the way won this war was military industrial complex stockholders and many of the senators who voted for it are still in office and were exactly supporting freedom fries many of our boomer ass parents all were guilty of being dumb enough to fall for the false information paraded around then happily supported the government as if nothing happened while signing up their kids for war who also mostly came back with exactly the mental instabilities you get from invading foreign land and needing to defend yourself from a people who want to murder you i really feel like the focus of saudi sportswashing is wildly misguided considering people in the united states have a lot of fucking work to do to account for and stop its own massive evils which are orders of magnitude more than whatever the saudis are doing like im not supposed to watch the nfl now because country bad i would basically only be allowed to watch swiss curling if that were the case very sad to see the club ive supported all my life become a laundering operation for these authoritarian monsters dont worry about it r soccer will always be here to explain away the behaviour of the middle east quick post another ronaldo highlight i still dont get how their sports washing is supposed to work for me it seems like that their tyrannical muderous regimes are getting more exposed than if they would have stayed silent this horrendous regime is trying to look good on paper with their modernisation efforts opening up for investments in other sectors etc whats sad is some unthinking folk believe their sporting project aka sports washing to be fine and gullibly buy into their propaganda howay the lads though as you walk around with fly emirates proudly plastered on your chest we all know this and yet the backlash of saudi owning newcastle is less than the backlash of mason greenwood dont get me wrong fuck greenwood but it really shows you how much of a hypocrite the media is true same goes for the u s and in a more general sense to the entire modern civilization rich people from all of our countries with assistance from all of our governments are and have been doing dispeakable things in africa in other underdeveloped locations and to their own working class we rebrand our culture with things like sports its nice for the west to have a mirror to look at an arab person being on the other side makes it more complex but some form of xenophobia wouldve had to be in this scenario anyway the saudi scholars who speak on the establishment are given year to life sentences with abuse no one wants to hear the oil couldnt have been handed to worse people every single bomb and bullet used by these fuckers have been provided by the west uk us and de hypocrisy at it highest almost people died among which were children in this war that has been going on since no one cares protest if you want change dont click on hit pieces anyone with a brain knows what saudi is doing fuck them and their shit league russia saudi makes sense and they are killing those people with weapons provided by nato you can cut the middle man and protest there some human beings are the worst things to exist in the universe but we already knew that i feel horribly conflicted about all of this i love the players i love the fans i love the city but we are being used to reform the image of despicable people and i hate it makes me feel sick the club has been tarnished i still get excited by our successes but a sense of hollowness persists longer than any glory i do often feel however that we as a fanbase are being asked to make sacrifices by people who have made none themselves you should be under no illusion the entire pl is being used its not just newcastle you may feel aloof and morally superior but you also have a voice i see no protests from other fanbases when we come to play and our away section is always full the difference is that you are not being asked to turn your backs on your clubs the silence is deafening you are right of course the premier league has been a playground for bored billionaires and petro states for a while now newcastle are just the latest propaganda project on the block its amazing that the clubs only choice was between an incompetent parasitic owner and a competent murderous regime soo happy the sport is filled with these sport washing projects s yet those players dont give a shit what are we the average football fan supposed to do complain protest nothing happens when money talks dont read the comments under the youtube video jesus fucking christ and we are funding it all with our dependence on fossil fuels and for the americans in the thread dont forget that ksa funded using nato countries supplied weapons yes go somewhere else with your hypocrisy while we in asia are excited about watching a super league with top stars in domestic time zone fun fact did you know that el classico just meant ronaldo vs messi for those outside of their respective clubs that is the power of football stars and the amount of tv money they can bring in apologies to epl saudi is a despot regime but im not quite sure how different this is from italian ships firing on migrants reddit seemed to be okay with that type of attack on migrants i dunno it seems to me that saudi arabia is a reprehensible government and that the world has been largely violent towards migrants and people escaping war zones and poverty for a better life this is why as far as im concerned i wont spend a minute watching the saudi league theyve been doing for years and the west is happy to continue their business dealings with them buying their oil and selling them advanced arms and weapons i find it hypocritical that this only now becomes an outrage and is getting attention because theyre snatching players off european teams and have become a legitimate treat on the transfer market newcastle fans oiiiii and stan kroenke and the glazers under pay their employees exactly the same but x any european country did atrocities too in the past so whats the problem you hypocrites i strongly advise anyone who argues like this to read a book about history specifically about slave trade feel like we should ban posts about the saudi league on this sub mods please i beg dont allow them to have any attention just a quick reminder for anyone in this thread that they all bought these weapons from the us for over billion dirtbags theyve been doing this type of shit for a while too sick fucking people disgusting theres a decent portion of the uk that would be happy if we did this with our migrants the demonisation of them in the press is horrific welcome to the camel league newcastle fans still feasting and dress like them nothing to see here amazon documentary is out saudis are great also eddie howe says fake news this but the uks asylum system is inhumane when we literally give asylum seekers free accommodation and food not just saudi most gulf countries are awful have they thought of the generational wealth the players will get though can someone explain why people from ethiopia want to smuggle into a country that is so brutal its like jews trying to smuggle back into nazi germany just wondering what theyre hoping to accomplish its amazing how sports can whitewash current situations soccer is irrelevant when it comes to geopolitics ive always been dying to know how sports washing works and how is it supposed to make me feel about saudi arabia i dont think any more highly of them now than before yh but newcastle got into ucl s oh i can just imagine what the majority of comments in this therad are going to be like strange how no one really cared about what was going on in saudi arabia until our takeover but now every fan of every other club has impeccable morals and were all disgusting for support the team we have done our whole lives elsewhere in africa everybody should read about the genocide that the arab supremacist rsf is currently conducting in sudan we sent a un mission to the darfur region about years ago but that hasnt stopped the rsf who descend from the janjaweed that perpetrated the genocide at the time from trying again yes the saf is propping up an undemocratic regime but the rsf is miles worse why is this relevant because the uae are one of the biggest allies of the rsf hemedti the rsf leader is close friends with the uae leadership personally meeting with sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan as recently as and the uae chad sudan air bridge is one of the reasons why they are able to continue tearing apart darfur and sudan as a whole several months into the civil war but basically nobody ive met knows that the uae is directly sponsoring this ethnic cleansing like this sports washing doing a great job here then eh they are crossing a border in an extremely bloody warzone accompanies by armed houthi smugglers i would be surprised if they werent killed not supporting this in any facet neither do i condone any whataboutery but i never see any articles posted about the sheer pillaging and raping the so called st world countries have done to the rd world countries lets acknowledge both of these issues as wrong and bring them both to light it is not whataboutery if i am seeking a fair coverage on issues either side of the border see usa supplying weapons to saudi to feed their war in yemen or see iraq iran afghanistan and the countless other regimes they have toppled for their own benefit meanwhile leaving a mass grave of civilians and multiple countries and their government in disarray whys newcastle getting all the shit what about city what if its true and what if it isnt probably of you watched the world cup hop off those high horses i didnt wait until you hear about the united states military but ronaldo said land of allah tho these are totally religious folks so how many people have uk killed over the years at palestine how many families have they destroyed how many children they left alone without their families stop the hypocrisy and stop believing everything you read online the world cant do anything about that they are us allies literally just murdering migrants im not a saudi bot but this has nothing to do with football you can share the crimes of many different countries so everyone in here whos grandstanding about morals and ethics yall gonna follow these rules right no interacting with any cr content no interacting with any saudi league content probably shouldnt support anything fifa then right so def no more watching world cup mmm nah no more euro prolly no more watching cl since loads of oil money oof also no prem then huh or did did you arbitrarily draw your self righteous line in the sand conveniently around all of these things since they arent quite as awful you can support the club and not the ownership you know oh yes but dont you see the newcastle fans trying to change the topic or give out whataboutisms at least with united r reddevils hasnt defended mc at the rate the newcastle fans are with saudi remindme month did the us not murder thousands of civilians in their wars in the middle east are we banning the mls too people on here have a short memory sure did those people should go to jail how does that make what the saudis are supposedly doing right let me go a set further all countries have done something shit in their past every single one of them dose that mean that we cant point out something shit that is happening right now the other difference here is that saudi royal family is the direct or indirect owner of these saudi teams and the saudi royal familly is the saudi government the us government on the other hand is not the direct or indirect owner of any mls teams by that logic no country every should be allowed to host a football league as long as everyone is greenlighting transfers to saudi arabia because players are following the money tell me what does a story like this means that they are sportswashing should be an open secret since the beginning a disgusting place run by the worst people to ever exist where are all the newcastle fans i mean anyone with half a brain can see why saudi could never be charged with unlawful war crimes for the situation in this article beyond the uk us and eu benefitting from this war financially because of arms deals with saudi this all lines up with their own foreign policies in regards to relations with iran the houthi src government is being fought with because of its strong relations with iran and the obvious anti western and anti imperialist stance of both governmental bodies ultimately this is a proxy war between iran and saudi where with the help of the src the iranians can establish a satellite state that can key strategic placement in targeting the gcc the saudis can very easily argue that they are deterring the migration of potential terrorist threats from the src government because they are in active war with them i think furthermore what a lot of people dont understand about this conflict is that the saudis are supporting the republic of yemen a democratic republic who suffered a military coup in at the hands of the src who took over the capital city of sanaa saudi is not blockading all of yemen they are blockading an insurgency group that controls about a fourth of the entire state but most of the populous regions both republics have been reprimanded for their lack of discrimination in regards to civilian casualties the conflict has resulted in child soldiers and targeted attacks on civilian areas from both sides which has led to both being blacklisted by the un i am not trying to make the death of the ethiopian migrants seem any less barbaric or wasteful but i am bringing the context to light which so many people on this sub about football are clearly not aware of in the slightest obviously all the security personnel at the border should be harshly punished for their actions and they should obviously know how to be more discerning but in reality this is no different than the us drone striking civilians in syria or israel bombing palestinians in the eyes of the un and all global judiciary bodies attention newcastle fans hope youre enjoying your shiny new transfers it is very disappointing to know a world where all the human right feminist stuff only focus on disney movie but left no eyes open on what really happening in the world and still we have people who support city and newcastle without feeling guilt absolutely disgusting anyone who signs for a saudi club is indirectly responsible for this the saudi government is a pure form of evil man city fans dont care saudi arabia has nothing to do with city but its not newcastles owners murdering people its been categorically denied that its ultimately run and funded by mbs yawn its not the fans of nufc starved for success that have turned a blind eye on a bloodthirsty evil regime and sported turbans as an ironic gesture yawn people need to wake up and get the saudi regime out of not just football but all sport and e sports golf football f csgo whatever your poison despite newcastle being sauidi owned we wont see of the media coverage of the united and greenwood case got maybe womens lives matter less if they dont live in the west yeah with the type of rhetoric in the usa i wouldnt be surprised if some politicians looked at this in envy and yearn especially with talk about illegal migration and border crossing theyve never had to deal with mike ashley though those ethiopians have it easy well it worked for qatar didnt it how many of us boycotted the world cup try to improve their image theyre succeeding thats whats concerning not killing people would do wonders for their image i wonder why they didnt try that first imagine your club was owned by these guys they need to implement some sort of protection like the nfl does in america the nfl requires that at least of the team must be owned by one person or a family acting together this person must also be a largest stakeholder they are the owner in effect so they can go into league meetings representing the entire organization so that eliminates investment groups from being able to take ownership of the team an example of this was when there were reports that the saudis pif was funding the bid submitted by brian davis for the commanders however that offer was never taken seriously by the nfl its sad but true i wonder how players feel when they read about stuff like this in the papers like it has to feel like shit waving their flag and reading this cruelty ofc its no different in other countries but here its such an open secret you would have to walk around blindfolded to not see it and im very sure what we read about the saudis recently is just the tip of the mount everest yeah and the united states is funding them but they dont wanna talk about that sky is blue why gme what is drs low karma apes feed the bot here superstonk discord

ensured the greed and corruption never happened again excellent work from pb thanks for sharing welp also i want to add something that i strongly believe has contributed to the evil widening wealth gap situation we now find ourselves in ryan cohen has made it very well known that his thing is not hurting shorts nor is it revamping market structure etc his thing is addressing the gross overcompensation of ceos board members and other directors funneling profits to themselves even when they havent invested a dime of their own money instead of spreading the wealth down to the rest of the organization this is old school and a threat to the current status quo in corporate america for reference compare the ratio of average ceo pay to average worker pay in vs today hint vs this hoarding of so much wealth by the people at the top has had devastating consequences to our society which now finds itself with the biggest wealth gap in the history of mankind just one of the reasons i find it so easy to get behind this man and i hope this doesnt offend you but this is why im such a pulte fan as well i think rc and pulte have a similar vision of wut should be and are going to make it the way it was wen ted and william were running their businesses youre evolving i wish this is all pb baby hoping they will comment for awards the median age to buy a house in was wow great read these stats are flabbergasting and horrific we need a planet of the apes to fix all of this in the rd year of the rd millenium anno domini the rise of the planet of the degenerate s began s were

work and so scary at the same time there is just the over arching feeling that society is moving in the wrong direction and u peruvian bull does an amazing job of articulating it this all tracks with a book i recently listened to trade wars are class wars klein and pettis trace the origins of todays trade wars to decisions made by politicians and business leaders in china europe and the united states over the past thirty years across the world the rich have prospered while workers can no longer afford to buy what they produce have lost their jobs or have been forced into higher levels of debt i recommend listening if youre interested in this macro historic perspective on countries and economic class its an incredibly detailed and well researched book the creature from jekyll island should be required reading for senior high school or freshman college or at least just how the bank of england spent generations worth family members trying to create a central bank in america they could control fucking parasites centuries of parasitic families destroying humanity if our generation ever wants to get out from under the boomers thumbs and remove the old guard we need to get off our asses realize that both political parties are fucking evil and start forcefully removing the parasites at the top and work our way down they all need to go theyve already destroyed our future our kids future generations to come will be enslaved by the current system and with these new government backed digital currencies smh gonna be dystopian for sure george orwell predicted all this shit yep i posted this as a thread on twitter thats now blowing up nice work welp you have completely ignored the fact that men commit self deletion at x rate than womem i will pass this along to pb quality dd here thank you for this post there is some great information in here people dont understand just how much power the fed wields over the populace a central bank is more dangerous to the people than any standing army for anyone who wants to learn more about the fed obligatory link to the money masters documentary i consider the money masters documentary to be particularly relevant to whats going on with the fed and the us dollar right now its a blast from the past but is packed full of interesting information and as an added bonus because of its age its not terribly graphical so it makes a good podcast if you just want to listen watch it https www youtube com watch v bm oergxs a the creature from jekyll island as read by g edward griffin https m youtube com watch v lu vqx j k frontlines

american dream and lost hope to everything now i have a gmerica dream and its beautiful i like this ape anyone blessing us with a tldr elisec in the comments then through the magic of qe quantitative easing the fed has exacerbated the worst houseless mental health and population crisis the united states has ever faced these issues are incredibly complex and hard to remedy and it may take decades to undo the damage this one is honestly worth your time splains a lot of wut has happened in this crazy world from a rare individual who can absorb it and regurgitate it in an understandable manner this post had upvotes when i clicked on it im not gonna upvote it beyond that damn thats a sign from the metaverse buy gme the fed is something man it really is i love how pb explains this stuff solid

job if you need your job you cannot ask for a raise and will keep taking abuse from management and work as many hours as they want you to for the same pay its a never ending vicious circle that was created by the federal reserve and the cabal that runs it great write up theres just so so much you can go into with the fed this is just scratching the surface this is the kind of stuff that keeps me

reposting here welp hell yea bud pb is top notch dd ohh ffs we just got done with the anti sec fud now we have anti fed fud remember kids orgs are made up of people and they are the ones who can be corrupted not orgs and as far as jpow is concerned he is the one raising rates finally bringing this free money bubble to an end forced or by free will that i donot know but he is a heck of a lot better than his predecessor ben bernanke who was there during the bailouts and literally gave away money at the same time refusing to put any conditions on banks as to how the bailout was to be spent and so they all gave themselves huge bonuses payouts powell should have raised rates years ago and he tried but cowered when truump pressured him to back off hes as guilty as all the rest of them no cell no sell ya gawwwwwwdamn right peteszahh nft masta im going to call it dont couple this stuff to gme dollar going away and hyperinflation isnt going to happen housing is its own bag of wet hair and i hope it crashes soon but even housing isnt trending in the direction of all this economy is falling dollar is worthless crap digital currencies and the dollar not being the king international currency is possible but all the other things are a zerohedge wet dream and very difficult to make happen even if they wanted to theyre either morons or geniuses not both if theyre genius why havent they succeeded already do i need to refer you back to gamestopped hearings again for how on the ball they are drs and hedge but this shit isnt hype provable fun or good it just comes off as conspiracy theorist prone at best pb reminds me alot of uw probably shouldnt idolize fwiw uw i think spotted and shines a flashlight on one thing and did the leg work and literal tech work to make it relevant of a problem everybody knows about but doesnt deal with enjoy the bottom of this post make sure to hydrate oh every day i wake up to all kinds of interesting dd explained to me like i was an ape fabuliscous ikr its the greatest show on earth its the greatest story ever todl commenting to read later in the itoilet the best thinking spot wow keep in mind it is not just the us this is felt all over europe as well except maybe for a few nordic countries how is this gme related that last part about social security is proof that it is in fact a ponzi scheme you need workers to pay out one retiree where did all the money collected previously go surprise the government borrowed it and because of that current payers into the system are not saving for retirement they are paying for those already retired fun fact about social security when it was created the life expectancy was a little over it was implemented to be an in case you outlived expectations and ran out of money it was not meant to be a retirement account it was more of an insurance policy end the fed end central banking repeal the revenue act of trying to survive long enough for end stage capitalism to strangle itself to death on the greed of the worst of humanity the only way to save ourselves is to save each other great post i wish people like powell and yellen would read this this is a really honest breakdown of real life economics and the repercussions of rigging the game for the rich it should be required reading for any of em before they take power is it only my blood that is boiling after reading this and knowing today will be another day where fraud will go on in the markets and nobody will be handcuffed and forced to close their illegal shorts we can no longer afford the super rich eattherich mafia this is a sexy read incredible work pb and welp i will take credit for the well that shit was bleak i dont understand how you take of someone elses dd thats emotionally triggering and then add even more triggering content on to it but when you think about it whats the fix to all this whats a better system than this passive system its the active and ethical free market system without monopolies good read i would claim these issues are in every industrial country stagnat wages ever more increasing housing asset prices mental drug issues and the consequences of these i as millenial dont believe that retirement system in my country will still exist when i get to retire so do many other yet most people arent wealthy enough to sponsor their retirement by only themself retirement system here is like a ponzi it works as long there is enough of new money coming in but what happens if there isnt hodling for justice fuck the crooks you cant blame the fed for all of it the fuckers running the world which admittedly the fed is part of have been systematically poisoning us with gmos medications and vaccines with only god knows what in them and various other chemicals and delivery systems the fed is a huge part of the problem but the wef and pharmaceutical industry is a better place to dig on some of this stuff imo of course excellent post thank you for writing all of this this is one of those things that we collectively intuitively know but often have trouble at least myself putting into coherence need help is it possible to crosspost this in other subreddits or will this be seen as a rule break by mods sure other people outside of superstonk here on reddit would love to read this lol finally gme guys are waking up too just a few years late but better now than never now educate yourself further and then you will understand why they tried to divert you from precious metals with their paper silver stunt their house of cards is built on sand and its so fragile that they cant risk people getting aware since there is only so much physical available once the physical is gone their whole rigged game of manipulation is over for comparison elon musk alone could break the system because there is so few silver available new cpi calculation will shine a better light imo they will all be deleted usa land of financial criminals weirdest thing there was a housing bubble crash in the s leading up to americas only years being debt free i think this is a re run and all the central banks attempting to push cbdcs this is a great write up as a social worker i can attest to many family and men shelters being at capacity i havent seen a decrease in birth rate i have seen a spike in mental health and drug and alcohol workers caseloads are becoming increasingly higher each day this one is definitely getting archived fuck the fed reserve we also have an obesity epidemic because people are being overworked and have no time to cook healthy food at home therefore theyre going to fast food restaurants and eating unhealthy food more often sewacyde should be suicide ah now the gop pro birth movement makes sense their atms stopped being born so they need people to bail them out how i so want to see these assholes burn how could you do this to your own people at least we are trying to do something to stop all of them and to think i just wanted a thousand dollars total from this play then they cranked up the money printer right along with the stock printer how is a government of the people allowing this you should build pride in your populace not strip them of it the only thing left to do we cant talk about here you will own nothing and you will be happy the balls on that lizard i swear same i wanted to turn my shares into a each and buy a bigger fast forward years and now i have xxxx no fianc e around anymoar and am on a world quest to end corruption and thats exactly wut im going to do i wish every person on the planet receives this message this is a great post ive seen other studies that back up a lot of whats being said here but this is comprehensive it paints a terrible picture but i do appreciate your post if you think this is bad wait until after moass has made itself known and the dirty deeds of the bare people may end up leaving the country in waves i fkn love you op which one im only responsible for the was actually lookin at postin ur new article next well done welp you just keep bringing it cant stop wont stop why didnt peruvian bull just post this themself they havent been banned have they apes are empowered because of gme drs we see the rigged system and found a way to fight back and self advocate too many people feel stuck without good options the iron bank for our got fans out there tldr can you elaborate on how the fed owning mbs causes inflation in the housing market i can see a connection but i cant quite connect the dots went to my bank to take money out slowly transferring to credit union and the teller asked do you want to take it all out thought it was odd but i think people are starting to see whats going on and panic op i agree with everything youre saying here ive known about all of this for years because im a conspiracy theorist and have been visiting conspiracy theory boards for like the past years but if you show this information to anyone normal and try to connect the dots they will dismiss you as insane its infuriating when most people reach a point in life where they have a decent job have a house have a spouse and kids have a car and a retirement plan and a future they wrap themselves in a safe blanket of delusion they stop looking at all the things wrong with society and try to separate themselves from the bad they convince themselves that they are normal what they have is normal and anyone else who isnt like them is abnormal and they work hard to build up a wall between them and everything they consider abnormal the american dream might have been normal in the past but its increasingly becoming out of reach and i dont think that today it is even commonplace i think the majority of our population is suffering and falls short of the dream to at least some extent and thats not right i noticed a similar thread about mass immigration and birth rates today on a game forum steam off topic and going into that place you can safely assume some things about the posters one they live in a house with electricity and internet access and two they can afford a gaming computer the vast majority of responses were negative and dismissive in nature i posted in the thread and was asked if i had taken my meds population decline and population replacement is an existential issue for our civiliation but the normies refuse to consider the problem the issue is abnormal to them so they need to move it into a different space and build a wall around it its infuriating and what infuriates me even more is that we are heading towards a huge collapse and the normies will finally address the problem only when society breaks down to the point where they cant live their normal lives anymore only then will they acknowledge the problem and talk about how it was unavoidable and no one saw it coming i think in order to get clean data we need to separate homeless illegal immigration out of these stats individuals in shelters due to the fact that they recently arrived with nothing could be directly tied to increases in immigration if were trying to gauge the economic situation based on americans wealth these individuals dont factor in until they get their feet on the ground get legalized and get jobs and housing which many will do the proper cycle of capitalism is a closed loop where wealth is not hoarded and keeps cycling through the system but now its become an oligarchy where most of the money and value is being hoarded by a very small group of people but they dont realize that their wealth only has value because of the below them and if they dont have any wealth then the value of the s assets also falls were seeing this happen slowly but surely in real time right now as companies keep reporting massive losses in earnings despite all the money thats being pumped into the system and how strong the consumer is but in a desperate means to keep the money for themselves the executives are deciding to fire their workers who are also their customers and consumers meaning theyll have even less cash to spend on them in the future and theyll have even more losses theres absolutely no way this system is sustainable and is bound to crash eventually conjecture about monitary policy is intended to sow distrust in american markets and foment anti american sentiments this is not relevant to gme this is propaganda this is why its important for apes to be strong together we dont invest together but we sure as hell got each others backs i e weekly ape help ape thread and we gonna have to double that effort when the markets hit the iceberg this looks at the fed unfairly can it be done better absolutely but the same qe programs you are critiquing were used in full force eg exercising of fed charter to save america and the whole world global economy during the recession of the pandemic in fact it took a whole months worth of qe in a single day to make a dent into the markets thats how panic struck investors were now im not saying i agree with what the fed does but out of all the institutions in america it actually has processes to maintain its credibility thus integrity by following highly risk aware models as its role of lender of last resort requires of it let me ask you this what would you replace the fed with it handles a ridiculous level of responsibility within a system that childishly hates accountability maybe one day when web becomes web web well have technology to replace central banking and central market making to truly stabilize the economy for all but we are so far from that for now orchestrated collapse you vill eat ze bugz for the last few decades houselessness has been on the rise in virtually every major american city drug addiction and mental health issues are of course the driving factors you lost me there bro thoughts on this data about arab support for recognition of israel its from saudis mostly against it but if the country does end up recognizing no one will care tbh walgeria i worked in algeria and one time and we had some configuration issue on the network and the only place with the same hardware and solution was israel we had to ask for a workaround but sending emails to israel was forbidden so we had to ask colleagues in south africa to call and get the details uae not there cause its and they are already best friend allies smh in reality its not emiratis oppose the ibrahimic deal the zionists but they cant say it in public because jail will be waiting for them that based on a friend of mine who knows lots of them its confirmed algeria and libya are more based than palestine mauritania am i joke to you common algeria w yall better than us from the arab opinion index this particular graph is on page phoenicianlebanese the highest rate of refusal to recognize israel was among respondents in algeria and mauritania at each followed by those in libya at palestine at jordan at iraq and tunisia at its okay we are still in the game i blame kurds for the regardless if they were surveyed or not i love my country oof mauritanians and algerians and libyans are mega super based not surprised by morocco tbh th the country is moroccan theres a lot of cultural overlap egypt still wrong i have never known an egyptian who doesnt absolutely hate israel and its even more in the younger populations the poll was probably conducted in tourist places saudis voting for something for the very first time based algeria those who dont know actually support but they are pussies to announce it i can only speak for saudi youths here which is most of the population of us are under the age of i dont think the majority genuinely supports israel or see them as allies and while there is a great amount of apathy hatred for some palestinians due to perceived ungratefulness the vast vast majority would be against any sort of normalisation remember even for those who dont really give a shit about palestinians jerusalem is still an issue and no one likes seeing their third holiest site desecrated year over year the only reason you may hear about normalisation now is due to tensions with the us if we didnt normalise during the height of our relationship in the trump era you think well normalise now that were getting comfy with china easing up with iran you think well normalise now that were getting comfy with china easing up with iran saudi can never ease up with iran if iran is nuclear and saudi isnt this is true and what i saw saudis say online only morocco wanting that tit for tat on their very own illegal occupation dont you have your own maori colonisation disputes to attend to i thought a lot more supported israel tbh glad to see some brotherhood even though this probably isnt too accurate free palestine what is israel there is no israel say it a couple more times just to make sure you manifest it xd that country that has muslims and christians in a camp and millions of other muslims and christians just waiting for their homes to be stolen by illegal invading squatters that country kuwaity brothers voted with isreal will literally sell you for a pack of cigarettes prob some expats i doubt this study is even half credible methodology seems solid you should check it out https www dohainstitute org en lists acrps pdfdocumentlibrary the arab opinion index in brief pdf the reason why half of the saudis surveyed choose i dont know is cuz they fear that both a yes or a no could get them in trouble which is an extreme level of paranoia yes the government care what people say and not say but not to this ridiculous level the of morocco will certainly get higher after israeli recognition of moroccos control over the sahara they already recognised it to the in qatar im going to find you its a little high for kuwait saudi arabia didnt suprise me dont know a lot of moroccan prostitutes out of agadier would love that we already see the israelis tourist in the hotels dont jordan morroco egypt and sudan have full diplomatic relations with israel anyway not yet for morocco the liaison office was just like the one we had before the second intifada of whats up with sudan did someone buy out of their population saudi sitting on the fence trying not to get snatched by mbs if one chart alone could explain why the middle east is a complete mess i know feelings are raw and that the implementation of isreal is highly controversial but for better or worse they are your neighbours for now and forever better to focus on building relations or else the region will never emerge from the mire its in its good then that they dont get to choose their leaders eh bro you guys had the choice to elect your leader and elected netanyahu so sometimes not choosing your leader isnt that bad at all to be honest id rather stand with israel than with hypocritical backstabbing bandits bro shut up we moroccans hate israel and you just named israel times by saying hypocritical backstabbing bandits typical moroccan l thoughts on marvels recognition of israel wtf is an arabian knight and this orientalism isnt subtle at all lol half the superheroes in existence are just completely based on their shitty pun names the fact they made arabian knight really isnt even surprising lol look up dust from the xmen lol her nemesis is journalistman arabian knight is a badass name ngl this guy should be like sinbad and alibaba on steroids the muslim superhero is a jacked guy with a sword badass literally me for real she looks like toothpaste marvel is western propaganda of course anything depicting western values as positive is western propaganda just as every bit of media depitcting islamic valies as positive is islamic propaganda sabra lmao marvels earliest and most impactful writers were jewish so it isnt a surprise that their sympathies lied with israel and relied on orientalist stereotypes people complain about marvel going too woke but in some cases it really is legitimate to change some of these stories sabra isnt always painted as a good person in the comics theres a panel with hulk where hulk is crying because a palestinian kid was killed by sabra during their fight arabian knight is also portrayed as a good guy in the comics c mics have always been propaganda i mean captain america exists xd they also made a cringe comic of and even dr mf doom is crying lol just dont take this shit seriously plus its old af there was a comic where she got a palestinian boy killed after hulk tried protecting him only for hulk to later verbally attack her and asking her why she would attack those who cant defend themselves it ends with she finally viewed the palestinian boy as a human or something like that this is some subtle anti arab racism which is messed up because marvel started as a civil rights metaphor where the hell is sabras sister shatila in all of this shes harsh to her enemies but sweet to her friends huh i wonder if shes ever attacked the arabian knight this makes me like arabian kngiht even more he is a chad muslim that does not cooperate with is raeli people and he knows that it is haram to form a relationship with a woman they team up later on israeli is not even a nationality btw they have jew ids it is a clever way to not even recognize israeli arabs there is no jew id the id doesnt mention if the person is a jew or anything else the id is blue its israeli if the id was different it means they were not israeli just like in every country only a citizen of the country can vote arab israelis are israelis so they can vote in israel you know that of israels population is arab right inspired by this comic the zionist scientists created gal gadot in a secret lab the warrior hero has to be a female to remind westerners that the israels opponents are woman hating savages the fuck is this lol youre a snowflake if you think this is propaganda they literally team up at the end are you trying to get marvel banned in the middle east i personally started boycotting marvel as soon as the news came out i would support its banning i once read an old american cartoon magazine for adults from the s not really a comic was a funny satiric comedy digest talking about women of the world the magazine seemed to glorify european women and men and their sexual life cringe and misogynistic af whilst also talking shit at chinese and indian men with ugly depiction of their cartoons suddenly the arab muslim part came and i was disgusted how they looked at us at the time they made it seem arabs are fat dark fat lipped sinister looking devils that lash their women with an ugly cartoon depiction they even talked how unattractive middle eastern women are i couldnt read it but knew the west was just as racist and misogynistic at the time is it her nationality or the fact that sabras a woman thats bothering you knight why no both i am harsh to my enemies yet sweet to my friends can you imagine any actor actually saying that line with a straight face this has the potential to be comedy gold arabian knight israeli female fighter merged into comics honestly thats a poor try by marvel didnt expect that im harsh to my enemies but sweet to my friends proceeds to bomb uss liberty theres a comic where sabra helped a village fundraise for the immune deficiency foundation just google sabra village idf to find out more this is why dc is better this is more funny than offensive it also makes it so much better that this character is forgotten by marvel they are trying so hard to cope lmao absolute cringe i swear to god man westerners have the most idiotic view of politics ever i love it when you guys dont let your opinion show in the title arabian knight is literally me the comic is very old lol free palestine that arabian knight looks like a turco mongol soldier that fights in timurid army lol marvel and their absolute shit of a franchise can do one also i cant help but think that adults who are into these things have developmental issues yes im an asshole but i reserve myself the right to pity people in their s who get hyped about superhero films especially since they dont see the propaganda in it yeah glad their entire companys going south you cant make any movie in the us featuring the military that isnt propaganda even nonsuperhero movies the dod and cia basically write and edit any movie scripts in order to allow studios to use american military equipment and save money bro wtf is this i looked everywhere for some fucks to give but sadly could not find any actually lol the jewish superhero can control peoples minds into thinking that what they own actually belongs to the superhero this comic is very old s marvel was started by jews dc too superman name kal el is hebrew it means voice of god when arab muslims invented t entertainment that is globally interesting you can tell your story too thos should inspire you hell even subsaharan africans are making chart topping acrobat songs globally your excuse is it her nationality or that she is a women mf look like toothpaste when is israel mentioned in a post title here hasbara trolls just spawn out of nowhere so many people commenting without reading you can tell its askmiddleeast from that alone lol as an israeli i do think there is some truth to that there is a sense of brotherhood imbued into israeli culture however it is my understanding and correct me if im wrong that arab culture is like that as well also why tf is arab knight just a racist caricature the cringe omg stan lee himself is jewish smash a lot to say about this mess but i dont know that recognition of israel is one of them she refers to an israeli people which there obviously is one thing that is very interesting is that the spiny pear she is talking about is a symbol of both the israelis and the palestinians i think making the arabian knight both antisemitic and misogynist or assumed to be one is a bigger problem for political representation i no longer recognize marvel i love marvel lol marvel try to make one good muslim character challenge and ofcourse the arabian knight had to be misogynistic who is arabian knight lol whats that wow thats why dc is better what were her powers decades old pulp fiction for children probably not the best venue to find a nuanced take on middle east politics i think the biggest problem is liberals who think they are entitled to speak on behalf of everyone muslims need a muslim voice christians need a christian voice and on and on someone call edward said asap i love how they just put the misogyny umbrella over the whole of the arabian peninsula like everyone who lives there hates women unsurprising its a multi billion dollar company they will die out with the colonial entity they support depends if shes a zionist or not jewess this is the dumbest shit ive seen in long while let alone the obvious propaganda they go again and plagiarize like they always do with everything shes gonna be in the mcu based theres a reason people remember neither heroes honestly this really racist both ways finally dont like it coming from an israeli arabian knights my best guess is holding a sword and wearing the clothes he wears the sketch is in the s what israelis are she speaking of israel established in the something fun fact marvel actually is older than the state of israel established in is this real aside from the looks and the strange characters why is ironman depicted as so dumb here the literal genius of mc isnt there a comic with a palestinian terrorist hero killing innocents israelis asking for a friend bruh im losing braincells looking at this arabian knight is better than whatever fuck that toothpaste bottle is also since i wanted to see if there is a hero from turkey i only got walther feyzioglu from earth blud is quite decent tho based cringe fuck this bullshit is his super power blowing himself up so iron man recognizing israel is the problem not that the arab hero is being antisemitic it s a drawing the titles ironic cause i thought itd be funni lol not just that but also the stupid attempt to tie his opposition to misogyny alongside children killer no titanium level cringe marvel has officially become the bad guy although in all fairness it was all made by a couple of jews so this shouldnt have been too shocking zionist apologists at marvel are really going to pretend that the torah isnt sexist af arabs need to stop seeking white validation they dont like you and its reflected in their popular media you want izza you want honour seek it from islam i dont mind the recognition of israel as much as the harmful representation of arabs short answer its the nationality stan lee was jewish solo yeah need more of this theres one with the hulk holding a dead palestinian child please guide me to these collectibles even if just online ok thanks truly an array of heroes i always thought funny that israelis took as symbol an invasive plant hasbarist rubbish has reached comics lol jews practically invented comic books as we know it you guys are so sensitive very woke of you to scrutinize everything u see about israel without any clear motivation or context thats the joke idiot bro its just a freaking comics thats the most absurd thing to be furious about man i wish these were my problems propaganda is dangerous especially through comics because you dont even realize youre consuming it nah just thought itd be funny to post israel of course they have to make us seem misogynistic try not to hate on israel challenge impossible for this subbredit you have the idf and some israelis to thank for that hallo all well youd be waiting a while for one if i rolled it lmao ill ne waiting caught a live nice

succeed once mark zuckerberg owner of facebook invited five people years ago to his harvard room reason talk to them about a business opportunity only two came to the meeting listened and helped their project today both are billionaires dustin moskovitz with more than billion dollars and eduardo saverin with more than billion dollars when a friend comes to talk about a business opportunity always have an open mind this is like talking to a lottery winner and concluding the lottery is a good way to get rich most new business investors lose their money someone like zuckerberg is an exception not the norm profile photo for pretty girl lets not forget he stole the idea from the twins who stole the idea from myspace this is a total bill gates theft that was performed on steve jobs steve jobs stole throm others like mouse interface on mac there is no good guys in this business only thiefs and liars and those who come on top are best liars and thieves simple as that youre right but the common success in starting a business is to dare it s not easy to dare daring and bravery dont guarantee anything in life we would like to think it does but at the end of the day no matter how hard you want to sell a product if nobody wants to buy it you dont have a successful business no the success like facebook is just an anamoly and not a norm of time you would end up wasting your money on some stupid business idea but at least youve tried something it better than being a regrettable spectator or aimless consumer at least ive tried something ive been offered business startup opportunities for an internet video game media comic book education companies all my life and when i was young i was dumb enough to be involved and do a lot of work for these so called companies only to have them flop and not get paid the worst one was a startup education software company making software for special needs children i spent a lot of time doing the base code and art design for the the software i gave them the demo to look over and they took it and run and i was paid nothing these startups were a complete waste of my time ive finally learned my lesson and ignore those dumb offers i dont dont look back at those so called opportunities and think at least i tried something i look back at them and think about what a young fool i was and how much of my time i had wasted you can say that for the nfl nba tv shows movies books stocks most companies go bankrupt in years so why try opening a restaurant knowing the odds should make you more fearless determined to do your homework know your competition and outwork them and out think them elon musk compa seriously you are giving elons example no these opportunities are really shite and you should not waste your time wow you guys are super negative the average business opportunity may not make you a billionaire but it could still be profitable whats the harm in listening even if you decide that the opportunity is not for you you may learn something but the returns on that th opportunity is much bigger i mean thats how angel investing also works times money gets written off but one scrub daddy earns you runway to do this shit for times youre not going to get invited to business opportunities though are you so its a waste of time if you only have a in chance of them being good propositions useless red circle i dont like mark but i have to admit that those are my favorite flip flops i have ever owned the addidas with the nubs on the bottoms are the best nah bro they hurt when you break them in i had to give them to my dad after a week i got the same adidas flips jack trotter when a friend comes to talk about a business opportunity always have an open mind except when its selling crack and pimping hoes on the street russell smith great margins though substantial regulatory risk peter sancroix open legs for the pimping open mind not really the option aldina fazou u are right i wish i would meet zuckerberger for some advice on the right way to be successful in a business to add to that some people have the idear but luck capital but some have the capital but lucks idea therefore they both need assistance immanuel okokon unless its all happening via an app called course correct anthony parry i have a great business idea it involves the titanic and wealthy tourists not many ideas actually work out well unfortunately bailey g make sure you use an xbox controller for steering instead of a logitech that was their first mistake lyndon sniper if you do so safely and dont cut corners in safety you can actually do it though youll probably have to charge like million per passanger and be allowed to only take like two people at a time many people dont realize that to build a submersable takes millions because of the materials you nee submerseble and passanger is crazy though cant trust someone who types this out either mate perhaps they dont and perhaps the only spoiled children but surely their millionaire father did hard work always more heavy to become first generation than the last tunnel man of course someone had to succeed to begin with some of it will be old money but much of the wealth around the world is borne of hard work or strong skillets or both usually mayuresh fulambrikar why does everyonehave a problem with nepotism it is an empire that someone created whether to burn it leave it to their descendants or to someone else is the decision of that oerson who are we to judge ian if nepotism was just a case of parent passing the company to a son daughter or other family member to do with as they will that would be their problem but its not often its government officials and civil servants giving jobs and positions to unqualified family members in order to secure their own position to ensure the board votes the way they want or to ensure their own embezzlement isnt discovered made public its this kind of nepotism that most people have a problem with however i for one am also pretty peeved with the self made million billionaires spouting on about how they became successful without truly acknowledging the massive step up they got from starting with all the money networking education etc handed to them on a plate c b if you got friends at harvard sure listen very true words as a young man i was also approached by a friend my age a woman i used to have fun with we were both non paid extras in a professional musical after five six months on the stage including a tour the play was to come to an end she asked me and another guy if we would like to sheldon j plankton my friend talk about bussines at im come and listen for hours nothing happen now patricia levis wow there are really good articles and interesting posts on your page i checked your posts and you always posted good writing can you follow me back on quora so i can always get notified in any of your posts and comments thanks s erra okay and he stole the whole idea of facebook did he not down to every last detail jeremy losek lets not forget zuckerbergs innate business sense to be born to well off family he was able to go to harvard and his father was able to give him a loan to start his business in reality if zuckerbergs family could only afford to send him to the local community college wed all still be richard amoako so how come myspace that was owned by a billionaire didnt survive if money was that important batman love the way how people shit on billionaires jim douglas i think id be able to put up with that if i was a billionaire it would be hard but i think id manage bailey g well i dont think theyre browsing quora and getting their feelings hurt over it so boys girls the life lesson that you need to learn from this is precisely this try to steal a really good idea from a couple of smart people without them knowing what youve done until you have time to launch it successfully as a marketable product that is as profitable as the creators had imagi tia never use these billionaires as examples no one will become like them you will be very disappointed and dont be hard on yourself when your idea will never match up focus on being more at peace in life ak wtf failures you talkin bout he got rich by stealing tyler and cameron winklevosss idea lance levier he heard their idea and realized they didnt have the vision of a worldwide social platform they just wanted to do a local harvard thing then they the winklevosss got millions and millions in cash and stock its not like the winklevosss came up with the idea for a social network social netwo klmj great last year a friend asked me if i wanted to join him in his new taco joint which seeks to revolutionize the way we eat tacos ill call him again just in case steve swann i know someone who invited people dozens of times to talk about business opportunities but nobody had much luck just frustrated efforts and a waste of time but that was amway julfazzlee have to make sure theyre from harvard or one of the top unis leoben dsfrendz no there are thousands of billionaires from india china russia europe middle east asia etc and theyare have involvement in oir technology padraig cuinn he stole facebook so yes he is a loser joonu thomas apropos the last line when a friend comes to talk about a business opportunity always have an open mind unfortunately a lot of business opportunities that friends talk about are mlms and ponzi schemes perhaps only in a million is a mark zuckerberg talking about facebook fokwa divine i was about to say that finna sprang how wealthy did the other three harvard bratts become in the real working mans world friends may reach out if theyre struggling some may network or barter a bit but friends and business really aint a good plan work is survival for us little people and i am done giving the harder you work joseph t fail several times until you rip off someone elses idea sure as if he was a genius a loser predator in the wings yet hes praised muti ur businesses opportunity of stealing university idea you cant force ppl some have their own business values and goals it is fine to be different and live the way you want without being millionaire it is also great if you are being one why do you want to be a millionaire if you are not happy they are happy then its good sounds like an overused anecdote for prospecting people into a ponzi scheme claudette perkins yes my thoughts i have been homeless and went through domestic violence but have yrs college and degrees and i am a senior in the criminal justice field a note it isnt how you fall it is how you get up and no matter what i always get up it about me and making it i have worked with homeless and s lubom r stejskal yeah people love to pass on opportunities and then complain about those who did not and managed to succeed because of that john doe we all know zuckerberg stole the facebook idea from fellow alumni jerry sam who stole the idea from myspace leoben dsfrendz so whats in it for you all tech millionaires and billionaires stole got ideas or learned from their peers or somewhere else study each brand whats impt is they made it bigtime billionaires innovators theres an abundance of people w bigger brains than they have why cant anybody do the same and amos totally agree man thomas schultz you are right in out of a million times but if you are right a in that one of a millionth time then that is enough david purr and then there is steve jobs doesnt really fit the mold as you will find many other great entrepreneurs and investors do not generalizations are easy to make but so often not true syed ali aatif he literally had sociopathic tendencies even his relationship with his own daughter was constrained leoben dsfrendz ive observed all great achievers innovators exceptional performers thinkers innocators etc have some sort of psycho trait disability we just have to cherrypick the good and discard the bad if nobody can explain it guess its just how it is sergio e he was a tyran not what a human being should be patrick holmes i see he still has the same stupid hairstyle alexander ismail his idea lets steal a local project from two nerds and use it to foster extreme right all over the world edward ryan i wouldnt necessarily recommend that opportunity to just anyone imagine making billionaires out of sociopaths and narcissists and then ushering them into positions of power and authority and then theyre invited to ted talks and who conferences and before you know it they are years old and leoben dsfrendz everybody wants to be like them exceptional achievers and their money but nobody wants to experience the psycho part theyve been through or are currently carrying though not fault of their own shiva shankaran whats the relation of your answer to the question noor fatima no doubt every business needs attention and loyal hard worker like him elvira ackerman yeah he also fucked saverin over and he won via a lawsuit against his best friend jerry sam how so if saverin is a billionaire ashwin kale here in india successful enterprises are familly businesses friends or anyone needs almost free workers jenny huff ive noticed that when a family is invested in a business they are more successful they keep the business in the family and each member contributes and works hard im talking about indian families in america where i live there are several family owned businesses that are managed entirely by the f ashwin kale exactly yousafzai btw who were the rest of guys nitesh kr there were other co founders as well such as andrew mccollum dustin moskovitz anr chris hughes and later on eduardo saverin left the facebook bob smith yeah right open door to lose all your stuff and more plus who wants to work with zuckerberg money is not everything in life richard amoako the thousands of facebook workers would disagree with you dragos leu correct vp not everyone can afford to work for free and thats the reality same with unpaid internships this then causes an unfair advantage for someone who doesnt come from a situation where their parents can fund their projects not showing up doesnt mean disinterest it means some have competing priori jenny huff so many of these unpaid internships take advantage of workers who are not in a position to work for free especially when these companies can afford to pay them they are told they will be paid in experience with a company that has a great name but could care less how that person is supposed to live arvind perumal how does this answer the question michael mustang so what about the sandals john boyland an open mind sure but not one so open that your brains fall out the vast majority of business ventures started by college students are not facebook theyre a waste of time and money that no one will even remember a year later just because someone wins the lottery every now and then does not mean bayuka well the problem is that my friend sometimes stab me in tne back not with a knife but a chainsaw sep maximilian this doesnt even answer the question g coble does this answer the question did zuck fail a few times richard mutumba do not forget that you need rich or well connected parents or both as well mr notifier why dont you talk about many businessman failed they also start bussines with so much effortness but you just tell the story about the person who everyone knew him so rich because it make you article always be right and seem to be convincing even the content may not meaning at all kresimir jelusic i talked to a bunch of friends to a bunch if opportunities spent k and none of it came back in years its less than chance of making it but were at it again john spartan why are his addidas flippies highlighted alex franklin imagine the other millions of times when friends have ideas that were worth shit mark schaumann that t shirt is a front for the global elite facebook was funded into existence with cia seed money and is a surveillance operation kingpet c survivorship bias chris parsons for a second there i thought it was going to say he put golden

sancroix i know its a long shot but if time travel becomes a possibility i am willing to go to the meeting patricia levis wow there are really good articles and interesting posts on your page i checked your posts and you always posted good writing can you follow me back on quora so i can always get notified in any of your posts and comments thanks milton rodrigues maybe we miss the point here zuckerberg was prepared to share his deal with the other in fact i think it was eduardo saverin and those twins who actually rowed in the olympics for them this was bigger than winning the euro millions lotto paresh terse so whats the question jesus santos even if i knew i would not become a millionaire i would go to hear about new ideas by a harvard intelligent student anyway emre sever i am wondering what the three other guys are doing now big jay are we just still gonna pretend that zuckerberg didnt steal the facebook concept off those harvard grads krzysztof kunicki as real as other american dream stories pradeep nope my homies still believe they can make a large robot dild l gure becoming a billionaire is not for everyone their vision of the future is very different from ordinary mortals they are molded differently their passion is intense and deep thats the reason that with billions of people on earth only a handful of them exist voters should be free to elect their representatives we survived though barely i honestly dont understand why we are so neuralgic about the specific issue of age the issue is fitness not age many people are living longer healthier lives so of course the average age is going up lots of demanding professions have base line mental and physical fitness standards to make sure they can do the job if we were serious about this question we would have a battery of mental emotional and physical fitness tests that everyone running for national office including supreme court justices would receive at the time of their first candidacy and every years thereafter after age tests would come every year this would be a non partisan qualification to stay in the pool of those fit for office maybe we could screen out a few of the psychopaths and personality disorders before its too late so you want to empty the house of republicans who should decide for you which person should represent your interests as long as you are a well informed rational human being you should vote for your representative who should meet the same prerequisites one reason why congress is getting older is that life expectancy has risen from around in the s to over today years ago many of these old members of congress would not have survived into there s and s that being said as we age health issues grow we naturally slow down and cannot do demanding work as effectively therefore there is a time we need to step aside and retire for many members of congress it is hard to give up the power with the aid of their staff who do much of the work older members continue long after they have the stamina for the job sen dianne feinstein being pushed around in a wheelchair by here staff is a prime example why is the republicans distribution skewed lower do they not live as long someone would have to explain to me why age is an issue in regards to elected representatives voters elect representatives do voters know the ages of the people they vote for voters cannot vote for anyone below the age of lets say twelve because the community assumes twelve year olds cannot comprehend the interests and perform the representative duties required by the community should people over lets say seventy five not be allowed to run for representative office because they cannot performed the required duties of the office they are seeking if so maybe those over seventy five years of age should not be allowed to vote the point here is why isnt the focus on voters as opposed to elected representatives i can answer that because it is easier to address the effects of a problem rather than the cause of a problem just ask the pharmaceutical industry the dumbing down of american representative democracy is an endless journey from years ago https josephurban wordpress com is the new i think feinstein is too far gone to even make a rational decision about resigning term limits rs and ds need to cut a deal mitch and feinstein go home not quite an even deal kys dem governor has already laid the groundwork for filling such a vacancy with a dem the state legislature passed a law saying an appointed senator needs to be from the same party as the one who vacated the seat but theres a compelling case that the law is unconstitutional not only is there no provision or mention of political parties in the constitution but its authors explicitly warned against them i have voted for feinstein forever and now she needs to call it quits she needs to go home and take care of herself and allow the governor to temporarily replace her with a younger black female until the next election california will do what it can to deliver on increasing diversity in the congress no matter what the maga zombies want california is where woke goes to live the front runner for that spot is marginally younger than feinstein barbara lee is age is up iq is down thanks to the magats it is a dangerous thing for a nation to be guided and ruled by the experiences and prejudices not just racial of a hundred years ago especially given how much our world has been transformed in that hundred years and what a dangerous precipice we stand on in multiple ways people who cling to power with their last breath do so only for the sake of power and those with few years left to live care nothing for the future that long ago became unreal to them this is all possible because our so called democracy is petrifying into a puppet show for the oligarchy having said all of that statistics are tricky things on a simplistic level there are far more uo in congress today because far more people live to be it would be interesting to know how many office holders retired in past periods of history what is the average number of terms that they served how long were they out of office before they died that might give a better idea of how we compare to the past however it does not change the fact that a nation should not be led by its great great grandparents in the s and s young people were drawn to politics in order to make a difference what we the boomer generation has done to politics has given millennials and gen z the opposite urge i have to think the conservative majority on the supreme court gets a great deal of blame for that with citizens united that decision monetized politics more than any other event if any decision should be overturned that is the one because the gop has not brought up a fake case to get this overturned tells me that they feel that it benefits them the most follow the money start w heritage foundation dont be too worried about age age is not the problem vulgarity lack of decency and sense of propriety are the most repulsive members of the house for example are relatively young george santos is years old marjorie taylor is lauren boebert is matt gaetz is madison cawthorm was when he was elected while the tea partiers that gained notoriety during the administration of obama were also young ted cruz jim jordan jason chaffetz judge them according to the content of their character not according to their age those representatives are in a class by themselves when it comes to impropriety ted cruz abandoned their little family dog snowflake to die in the worst ice storm texas ever experienced for that alone he should be thrown out of congress two words term limits or as trump might say it one word term limits ballot access for independents would solve a lot of this easier than getting congress to police themselves whatever that means americas political representation has gotten really old people are individuals not ages races religions parties genders etc so you oppose the year old limit in the constitution as well and you dont think that there should be an age requirement for driving a motor vehicle voting etc some are ethical and duty driven others are in it just for the power congress a place where america comes to die the constitution has an age limit for eligibility to be elected president its logical that the constitution should be amended to have an upper age limit for serving as president in congress and on scotus in corporate america they have mandatory age limits a majority of firms in the s p and more than a third of s p firms have policies in place that mandate the retirement of their ceos at age including general electric altria exxonmobil and intel the federal government should emulate this practice with all the advances in modern medicine we can see where our scotus justices and our senators could be serving into their second century of life its logical that the constitution should be amended to have an upper age limit for serving as president in congress and on scotus disagree thought id dearly love to have more youthful potus that said i also believe that bidens age aka longevity is the reason he was able to beat trump he had a very long record of accomplishment including veep during his tenure he has gotten along well with republicans who began to savage him as soon as he took office see mcconnell graham on upper limit the candidates age was know when they won the election at that time we had a choice and selected elderly we cannot bemoan age when it was very much on display additionally not only did an aged trump win he had no experience and thus far a solid lock on maga republicans so much so that the others fear him his base is lusty with boos for everyone else they attacked the nations capitol all to push a lie just a reminder that old joe has done more in his three years of office than most modern era presidents omg get out retire ill take an year old pelosi over a something boebert and gaetz anyday they are also deciding laws on new technologies and have no idea how it works so are the founding fathers but according to originalists this is the way it was intended no women or children and blacks were of a person the constitution and the resulting laws were designed to be flexible enough to adapt to changes both technological and societal the gop through scotus has determined that the inherent flexibility is woke i believe that term limits not specific age is a better approach i confess that these are the politician who likely best represent me sigh maybe it isnt the age but the integrity good point if congress was substantially younger you could see a whole array of benefits being shut down for the elderly the spectral shift of congress serves the needs of the people better as for the integrity my personal experience is that the younger set believes that cheating and lying is acceptable to get ahead recent article about resumes in wapo confirmed that notion its not the age of congress but the age of likely voters that determines pointing benefits at older people someone over is far more likely to vote than someone under because the aged cant possibly be expected to understand laws on new technologies you are a bigot ageism is the last accepted form of bigotry in this country i would bet im older than both of you if you havent hit your th then i am correct i am a retired engineer that is not afraid of technology like so many of our congressman and women that have not taken the time to understand what they are voting for to watch them in real time in congressional hearing stumble over their own words because they dont understand technology makes me sick so saying that i am a bigot just shows your bias more than anything i would bet im older than both of you if you havent hit your th then i am correct i am a retired engineer that is not afraid of technology like so many of our congressman and women that have not taken the time to understand what they are voting for to watch them in real time in congressional hearing stumble over their own words because they dont understand technology makes me sick so saying that i am a bigot just shows your bias more than anything but the older generations still dominate congress im pretty well convinced wed be getting better more realistic responsive climate legislation if we had many fewer older representatives who wont have to live with or die because of escalating climate blinking red lights alarms older reps tend towards dismissal because of their time bubble resistant vested interests supporters recognizing their behavior practices have to change hard to convince anyone who owns multiple residences in various climates that obscures for them overall trend lines psst you stand a far better chance at climate regulation with an year old democrat like pelosis than you would with a year old republican like boebert gaetz stephanik etc bs most of us care deeply about our offspring and the future of the world you re listening to a few rich and selfish so and sos what i cannot understand is why the young folks stand around moaning about the elders running things instead of oh say voting themselves getting out to support parties that come close and turning them into somehting better running for office the selves don t you whine about boomers as long as you sit and crying instead of getting up and acting we re the ones who drove back the fascist forces years ago and we re still trying to hold those dikes alone we are living longer and having fewer children therefore the need for term limits increases or else well have the same people in office for decades the public and mcconnells constituents fewer e to know exactly what the neck happened hete not simply have it brushed off as im fine now its good they have access to that amazing government funded free healthcare et cetera no they pay for coverage just like other citizens although they do have a very generous retirement package perhaps more should use it hmm looks as if there are far more dems than republicans older than in congress it must therefore be a good and just and right thing because we walk the path of goodness and justice and righteousness in all our ways but if it were bad itd be the gops fault interesting report on an aging congress but its not surprising as life expectancy increases so does the average age of congress has congress aged more quickly than society as a whole id say yes and a bigger yes to some yorkshire puddings the current class of lawmakers is one of the oldest in history with an overall median age of the median age of senators is the highest on record in the house the median age has hovered between and for the past decade higher than in any year before that period gerry meet mandering the interesting thing is that there are actually more people under on the gop side of the house in the chart and more people under in the senate on the gop side unexpected this tells me that the democrats are not preparing the next generation for leadership my suggestion is that the senate vote to expel both diane and mitch simultaneously to keep things even steven al it takes is a vote but that will never happen because the same thing will or should happen to them as their brain cells slough off as much as i respect year olds being one of them there is no way a person that old should be president or in the senate there may be no dementia but forgetfulness and simple lack of energy cause bad decisions trump is in a class of his own he has spent a lifetime of doing the evil he does and it is so ingrained that he can spew it with energy in his sleep but dont ask him to think thoughtfully about anything so what the article lacks any attempt to offer insight or context on whether this a good thing or a bad thing and why we know that the leaders of our representative democracy are not representative on a variety of dimensions race gender income occupation among other things maybe this body was representative when both its members and the voters were limited to property owning white males the latter has changed the former has not and commentators in the post and elswhere wonder why people have lost confidence in this institution i did not realize the average age dipped so low in the s maybe that is why age limits were put on the back burner committee assignment and ego are keeping most of these folks here too long age limits term limits needed humm the dems look pretty flat in their age distribution the repubs look like they have killed off their elder statesmen whats with that the constitution sets minimum ages for elected offices so it is clearly constitutional for congress to set maximum limits say doing so would also discourage the re election of representatives and senators only because they accumulated seniority in the house or senate and can therefore control key committees given longer productive lifespans an increase in workforce age is generally expected wisdom not age is the essential criteria for knowing what to do when and how those concerned about not having enough youthful input need look no further than the congressional staffers who are considerably younger and able to provide a youthful perspective to decisions when voters choose competence and wisdom over politicians pushing phony issues we will get the representation and leadership the country needs until then our congress will reflect our own poor choices that hurt us all sudden freeze up he had an ffffffing stroke orwellian at wapo do you expect wapo to call it a stroke when no medical determination has been made public he looked like he was possibly having an absence seizure which wouldnt be surprising after his fall and concussion several months ago i had them when young usually they were accompanied by music generated by my brain had one during a piano recital didnt miss a lick on the piano even though i blanked for several minutes dang that brought back a memory i had a similar experience during my piano recital only i un blanked during the piece didnt know where i was and just got up and walked off was it really a concussion several months ago or another tia feinstein mcconnell and other congress members in their age group should retire they simply cling to power for powers sake and offer no benefits to the country in fact they harm the country its high time to institute age and term limits in congress mandatory retirement age will weed out the doddering power sucking greedy malingerers and term limits might help minimize the damage caused by blustering idiots if you are concerned about the direction our country is heading as a result of know nothings i e the modern republican party then you should contact your local democratic party and do your part however small it may be to ensure that this mentally and morally challenged party is thrown out of office in i live in latvia which has a member unicameral parliament our most recent election was last october the youngest elected mp was while the oldest was the average age is years old there are only a few political parties in this country which have been successful for more than one or two election cycles in last octobers election only three of the seven parties that were represented in the previous session won sufficient support to win seats in the new session this means lots and lots or turnover it is also true that parties in latvia are elected on the basis of candidate lists and not individual candidates in america you have first past the post in the house and the senate and for all practical purposes only two parties that means that a single senator or house member can indeed hang on longer than might seem advisable i think our system here in latvia is better at least one the basis of this one very specific issue important things can still get done with a high rate of turnover just curious thats been an argument here against term limits in both houses like terms in the senate in the house which would each be years of course not much gets done here you wonder why a feinstein won her last election because no good democrats ran against her california has good democrats that could run but for some reason people are afraid to disturb the structure the average age of congress is rising theres no one to blame but the voters i blame the campaign finance system which forces unwanted candidates down voters throats i still blame voters i am boomer why are we and silents and greatest making laws and judging issues we a no little about and b wont be around to be affected we had our chances we blew it climate change anyone step aside or are you so addicted to power and perks you just cant let go congress is a country club once youre in you never want to leave career politicians are the problem this is all they know their egos wont let them retire we also have more millionaires in government than ever before we need limits on all of it they wont limit themselves once elected their hand is in the cookie jar they arent giving it up until they are taken out on a stretcher i am getting a bit weary of articles complaining about old people not caring about younger people old people being senile wealthy people not caring about the poor people who were brought up in a racist society being racist and so on the characteristic of age or wealth or lack thereof does not define who you are what you are capable of doing or what you think joe biden has a wealth of experience in his work and has used it for our country to the good would you rather have desantis for example because he is younger there is more than about age the incidents have involved health if you are an iron man athlete thats one thing but clearly were not talking about that not just age limits but term limits are needed specially for scotus we need younger folks who are living and will continue to live through these existential threats eg global warming to humanity wheres the chart depicting efficiency if she were dianne smith instead of dianne feinstein she would be propped up by the fish tank or the weather channel in the memory care unit while her accounts and assets are seized to pay for her care once these people get a little bit of power its hard for them to give it up best reason for term limits vote thats what term limits are a lot of these old geezers are still in there because people vote for them and theres something to be said especially if youre a senator the longer you stay in the more influence you gain and the more things you can do for your state voting only goes so far why because its hard to get candidates because of the money involved there is so much money in politics right now in the average campaign cost last year million the average person doesnt have enough money to get very far you must already have a lot of money especially if you are the opposite party d in red state r in blue state never mind that the name recognition claims the major party money raised citizens united lack of term limits and long campaigns have ruined politics for the younger generations its hard to pay for your kids mortgage and find time to fundraise millions of dollars we get the government we deserve we get the government that is forced on us thanks to citizens united im and is too old to be in congress the us looks feeble on the world stage biden cant read a teleprompter are we expected to believe hes running the country trump is the stable genius who decried the use of prompters until his staff pressed him to use them to mitigate his word salad rants during events by essentially every parameter the country is doing much better under biden than it did under trump and as far as running the country is concerned trumps only plank in his platform for is vengeance there was a similar article about this in the atlantic a while back running for a national office does require making connections having some experience under your belt and being fairly well off its especially true in the senate where i believe everyone with a couple of exceptions are multi millionaires and to be honest some of these younger members are completely unqualified except theyre telegenic and have a twitter feed or say stupid things and get a following examples aoc mtg anna paulina luna bobert etc imho comparing aoc to the crazy mtg and luna is ludicrous wearing an eat the rich dress and cavorting with rich people while pretending to represent all the brown people in her district is pretty stupid some of the younger people may be unqualified but so are the older people need we be reminded of the ridiculous questions asked when social media and internet bills came before congress at least aoc and mtg know what dial up versus fiber internet connections are yes age is important but perspective and philosophy are of greater importance are they impacted by your life experiences and the age in which you came of age sure but in our current situation what is critical is which of two paths you as a pol pledge to take forward or backward there is no doubt which of these two paths the dominant philosophy of the two major parties are committed to hard evidence is the legislative cluster muck now on display in the house of representatives and in numerous state legislatures across the nation the choice among all voters regardless of age is very simple forward or actually believing you can turn back the clock and recapture some mythical time when we were a white christian nation ruled by an economic elite who was deeply committed to ideas which consigned more than half of us to second and third class citizenship the progressive agenda is not perfect but it at least addresses the issues of the day and the future my old party the gop has regressed from being conservative to repressive in order to retain what power it gained and worst of all it now embraces principles of exclusion its once highly touted big tent has closed to women non whites the poor and yes anyone who might not identify as straight as if ones sexuality is a choice instead of yes how god did make you talk about a contradiction to actually embrace a version of christianity predicated on hatred and exclusion rather than love i now vote almost solidly democrat not because i believe in everything some in that party push but because the option from the other side has become bereft of logic common sense and yes principle it is my hope millions of younger americans i am to join me this election cycle to send a message to what is left of the republican party it is time to start looking forward and not backward brilliantly written it is a foolish notion that the elderly in our govt will be replaced by the young old people are always replace by new old people old people are not going anywhere there is a pathetic sickness to those that can afford to comfortably retire and dont personally i think they are very empty people and their job is their method to side step human consciousness the mother of all horrors biden should set an example and resign due to his advanced age and growing dementia point taken this article would have been much more worth reading if it contained anything but the raw numbers im not a big fan of age limits but i think a term limit of or terms in the senate would be appropriate after that long senators shouldnt be reelected no matter how old they are because theyll be too firmly ensconced regardless of their mental state in the current senate a year limit would mean that grassley and mcconnell couldnt have been reelected a year limit would have eliminated feinstein and patty murray maybe we could have a rule where senatorial candidates above a certain age have to have a running mate who will take over if the senator is incapacitated so that the voters know whos waiting in the wings the problem is that the people already in congress consciously or not enact laws that favor their own generation this makes it increasingly difficult for the subsequent younger generations to build wealth and have or raise the type of money required to run for congress someone recently tweeted for an american aged there are only two types of work available walmart greeter us elected politician i think age limits are well overdue and im already above them i think should be the age limit to run for office and should be the mandatory retirement age for all congress people all judges and for the president and vice president i get so frustrated every time a senior citizen government office holder rattles off some plan that i dont agree with so many congress people do not have any military experience and yet control the military e g sen tuberville our country is in need of age limits we have many in government that lack comprehension and are completely illiterate in most technologies please enough about trump if californians want to re elect yes i know she is not running senator df then they have that right one that should not be taken from them same for mitch sadly these older people in congress need to retire when one is no longer effective in your job it is time to move on same for judges and the supreme court we really need term limits for all these positions no as ny mayor ed koch once said the people have spoken and they must be punished the system has been corrupted by gerrymandering and money hopefully someday a third party will break through and upset the status quo congress is the nations senior center complete with a bickering bunch of old folks eating lunch in the cafeteria why would a young person want to spend time there edited the depends generation is taking over and holding on to their last day because they have non jobs just talking heads it takes a least a decade to make an effective politician ready for national office you start off on something like a school board where you learn how to read and implement government regulations you move in to town or city office where you learn how to deal with constituents and deliver service then you move on to state wide legislative office where you start to learn how to write laws and work with parties and voting blocks basically how to get laws pass you are not going to find college courses to teach you this there are no degrees and havent we all seen how bad it gets when people take short cuts around this apprenticeship ever time some puffed up person who believes years in business or as a celebrity decides that they can shirt cut around the training with their wealth the people end up paying for it so if you really want younger people in congress they have to start younger and not wait until they are in their s to run this isnt a conspiracy it is about learning how to do the job absolutely and why it is critical to vote in every local state and national election or you can say outrageous things develop a retinue of on line followers and run for congress term limits term limits term limits term limits the average lifespan in the us in for males was average age of house senate the average lifespan in the us in for males was average age of house senate i think the problem is exacerbated by party politics there is this entrenched anointing process see hillary and fear of weakening incumbents with challengers see biden and feinstein because these politicians refuse to let go to my knowledge the only politician ive seen hand the keys over to a successor is pelosi lbj i guess feinstein should not have run six years ago yes californians elected her but they had no choice did they id have voted for her too if she was the nominee when schumer is nominated again and runs against some loon gop candidate ill have no choice either biden and the dems should be succession planning the problem is theyre all logan roy none of them wants to give it up the distribution of house democrats is really interesting compared to the senate and house republicans it seems fairly even i notice a spike at and i wonder what that is the american people dont take their politics seriously enough these politicians conduct serious business for the people just voting for a name or a party or to make a statement is destroying the nation what would the senate be without bernie angus king is about and he looked very sharp on the committees his questioning was dead on susan collins is mediocre and always was i could do without her she thought trump learned from impeachment and she voted for kavanaugh despite a promise to protect rowe admittedly most of the better known octogenarians are still in full command of their capacities but term limits remain imperative as a remedy against career politicians over time developing walls of resistance against challenges of their abuses for personal gain and disregard of all voters interests ambivalent but what about the truly loved politicians who win by a landslide term limits deprive them of their choice i propose a compromise raise the percentage by which an incumbent must win surely bernie sanders can get of the vote the average age of congress is rising thats unlikely to change soon average human lifespans are rising as well and medical capability to extend and preserve life has never been better for thousands of years cultures before ours revered their older members respecting the value of their accumulated experience and wisdom the term elders has been used to describe leaders the world over as long as a person retains their mental faculties age is not a barrier to leadership it is in fact an advantage because an older person will have more experience to draw on to make judgements i do favor term limits for non elected government positions such as scotus justices but for elected positions let voters decide when a person is past their prime in the end its not about age but about results the odious moscow mitch mcconnell apparently doesnt have the mental faculties to be senate minority leader i fear he has mental lapses off camera that we never hear about chuck grassley and dianne feinstein also have questionable abilities i support age and term limits i believe many voters simply vote their party line without careful consideration of the individual candidate consequentially we have a geriatric congress people have the right to vote for whoever they want to represent them if they choose someone impaired by age by a mental defect or some other detriment they can do so and it is not the right of other people to tell them they cannot make that choice in we elected someone with a number of mental defects as the president of the united states that was an incredibly bad mistake that we are still having to pay for but it was the peoples choice under the rules by which we run our democracy people make mistakes smart people learn from them the problem is that the people already in congress consciously or not enact laws that favor their own generation this makes it increasingly difficult for the subsequent younger generations to build wealth and have or raise the type of money required to run for congress bernie sanders is one of the oldest members of congress at but his goals find great acceptance among both young and old im sure some in elected office favor their own generation more than others but that would tend to make them less electable over time age bias will be found out by voters and end up being a problem that voters solve themselves im not a big fan of age limits but i think a term limit of or terms in the senate would be appropriate after that long senators shouldnt be reelected no matter how old they are because theyll be too firmly ensconced regardless of their mental state in the current senate a year limit would mean that grassley and mcconnell couldnt have been reelected a year limit would have eliminated feinstein and patty murray elections are a natural way to exercise term limits voters decide when a person is too old to serve them well its not age that is the problem so much as it is the corruption addiction to money and power hatred of the poor and vulnerable and unwillingness to represent the majority who are pro choice and demand federal gun control legislation and that applies especially to many younger people in congress especially those on the right matt gaetz nancy mace lauren boebert for example there are a lot of older democrats in congress like pelosi who fight to save programs to protect the poor and vulnerable to expand access to health care support womens right to choose and regulate guns i would take nancy pelosi any day over the much more youthful mace or boebert so not congress being old but congress having too many republicans of any age yes no age limit there the average american is years old in the average age of a u s senator is almost twice that at age how can we expect people twice the age of average americans to pass laws that consider or benefit them its about whats best for the nation not a particular age group of the population or constituency some life experience as an adult is appropriate people in their late forties to mid sixties are probably best suited politicians are like pro athletes they hang on beyond their prime years because they cant give it up most of them dont know how to do anything else and have never had a real job to put food on the table with a paycheck the corrupt system in place makes politicians rich and athletes make far too much money same with hollywood actors they all use their resources to stay in control we can see decline of athletes and eventually they retire politicians stay far too long we desperately need term limits now we need younger people in power with fresh ideas for the current world nobody wants an year old president we have many talented people in their s and s with quality experience who should be in power comment of the day nancy pelosi reached her prime in her seventies when she played a key role in getting the affordable care act passed and she went on to accomplish a whole lot more right now two senators that you would see pushed out because of their age the year old elizabeth warren and the year old bernie sanders are pushing hard for a crackdown on insider trading dimple truth young people want nothing to do with politics not true the old establishment wont let go https www washingtonpost com politics ryan ohio senate vance democrats yes dimpled people make cute politicians maybe members of congress should be screened for dementia starting at age mtg is demented and shes nowhere near tfg is demented and will be at the end of a second term the problem is that we have strayed from the founders design which didnt involve antibiotics or chemotherapy or sterile surgeries for elected leaders we can solve our problem by returning to the founders original vision founders founders founders yeah sure lets idealize a bunch of rich white slave owners some more it is almost like we need to see a shrink this absolute need to worship these people the sooner we let go with that and change year old document the sooner we can fix our country i think you need to leave this country i just dont trust americans today to improve on the constitution if it is torn up and redone it could easily be worse actually minus some change and perhaps you should have read past the word founders i think you need to leave this country gee can you help me find a job in the eu easy to say you dont like it get the hell out in fact any year old bully in the elementary school can shoot his mouth like that term limits for potus for the house for senate years for judges age should have nothing to do with it limit the time in power no matter how old or how good the person might be a rolling stone gathers no moss so you shouldnt be allowed to continue even when youre doing a good job who defines good many think trump did a good job personally i would disagree wholeheartedly and years was years too long see i did mean to say years for judges not thats what happens when you dont proofread your comments i have been convinced for years that term limits on the order of terms in the house in the senate and longer term as president perhaps years combined with campaign finance reform would do more good for the nation than any other efforts fix the system before the symptoms if feinstein retired now newsom could appoint a democrat in that spot but republicans would not allow that new democrat to take feinsteins seat on committees they have to grab power wherever they can no matter how unethically when the senate sets up rules at the beginning they need to take into account the ages of their members and that there will be illnesses and such they need to change the rule that allows them to replace a member on a committee should it become necessary but we do need a younger government am older myself we need more fire and fight they should have kept her off that committee at the start of this congress these people all lack the will to do tough things it is their exclusive club and how dare you question a fellow member view from outside usa your leadership is too old hanging on like grim death to the power of politics and the judiciary usa is big country with many talented young people australian voters overwhelmingly voted to amend our constitution for high court judges to retire at aged unfortunately diminished cognitive decline means some officials do not know when their time s up and your country is poorer for it age with grace and let the young take over when its time you have to look at this from a distance our society is corrupt these guys from feinstein that kentucky guy or biden they all have a group of people who are so called assistants they also push the person to stay where he she is because it suites them these congress people as long as their front person is in d c they get to stay in d c with that salary with biden on top of all the dnc people it is one of his grand kids who likes to continue to live in the wh she and her husband both work for biden and live in the wh so yeah grand pa run for i like to continue to live in the wh everybody is out for number uno how can anyone in this country expect to retire if the leaders on congress cant even do it people often are wiser when older and if they are healthy and able to continue working then let them do what they can do getting good people to run for office is hard because they have to be able to raise millions to compete have to support themselves and family while running and must be able to land on their feet job wise and financially if they lose if that doesnt shrink the number of people wanting to hold office add to it the dirty underwear airing and the creating of fake or enhanced versions of said dirt designed to destroy the credibility and marketable persona of a candidate this isnt for a young person who works and has a family it is for someone backed by a very wealthy person or a very wealthy person older people may have made it inherited their own fortune and that gives them a bit of freedom to act and be political frankly many older people are quite competent and some younger ones may have more energy and fewer wrinkles but they are not capable of analyzing a situation crating good sellable policies and holding together their people just disregard policies pushed and contrast the effectiveness of former speaker of the house pelosi with current speaker of the house mccarthy who is much younger than pelosi pelosi wins taxation without representation no wonder most adults under the age of cannot afford to buy a house or have children these days no one at the federal level is there to vote for their interests vote for the right people instead of whining who said i dont vote age gives experience so again vote for the right people to represent your interests i dont suppose congress will pass upper age limits for office just as we have lower limits for office or voting age you could argue some people can serve capably in their s but then again some year olds might be informed voters turn the graph sideways and the house chart has a bell shaped curve to it yep we the baby boomers are still dominating and unlike corporations these leaders have fabulous benefits and staff who are willing elderly caretakers for great resumes our founding fathers and their peers had a life expectancy of maybe their s to them living well into the s didnt factor in but franklin jefferson and adams did live to be elderly so hence i guess they only saw a need for minimum ages maximum ages didnt seem needed were stuck with them all dont criticize feinstein and grassley blame stupid california and iowa and we should also blame the states and districts that elect people like trump green boebert cruz desantis abbott gaetz etc who or what do we actually blame for electing the biggest mistakes in history education television apathy ignorance stupidity all of the above nope hold the individuals accountable for their failure to represent their constituents they are of no use to themselves nor to anyone else and are both drains on american resources a big part of the problem is that so many current politicians justices etc have no life outside of politics thats why they run thats why they stay i have a tough time thinking of even one republican and many dems too who could hold a minute conversation if you didnt talk politics trump has a life outside of politics golfing all day everyday and he still stinks at it shuffling boxes filled with classified documents around mar a lago searching for lawyers for his many criminal charges and civil suits he has a life after politics thanks to his foresight while being president golfing btw is part of a life in politics it appears to be the sport of choice on capitol hill if youre in politics youre going to have an ego and wont want to retire voters love a familiar name and will keep voting for their representative until they die if people treated an election like a job interview instead of a chance to prove their party loyalty the u s would have better leadership either we let the voters decide or we change the constitution easy or hard that is whats wrong with our nation older folks want to go backwards not forward baby boomers were born between and the civil rights act was only signed in so they all grew up in a much more racist society we had the new left and i met several spanish civil war veterans the lincoln brigade they were in their s to s then the left of their era had been anti racist the article is missing a larger point that this isnt actually just in politics the average age of upper management is also ticking up all over you find the same thing in workplaces with boomers working past the retirement age and holding onto positions into their s no not just for more money its entirely representative of the boomer stranglehold on the population and the mindset of enjoying leadership positions as well as everything else so much that there isnt much care at all for the ones below them more ageism as if we were a club just because someone is older doesnt mean they dont have the capacity to deal with complex situations as demanded by their government position all representatives should have physical and psychological evaluations to insure they are able to deal with the demands of their office at ages the medical profession can determine physical and mental changes may occur the results of which should be made available to all other representatives or a select committee and if needed those in question need to be considered for replacement you are denying the following generations leadership positions and experience in those positions while ignoring what they clearly bring to the table compared to out of touch old folks that cant understand social media tik tok or ai its not just about if you can do it thats the entire boomer problem there is absolutely thought given to next generations and what they need to succeed entirely selfish and greedy in all aspects former british prime minister boris johnson wore a

proclaim his love for russia all over the back of it he is a dangerous dishonest turncoat manipulative and fickle in equal measure never to be trusted and not to be listened to an industrial revolution without overt visible pollution alternatives to coal background fantasy setting highly rural pastoral social landscape is significantly more egalitarian but far from idyllic with no serfdom tying a peasant class to the land magic exists but wizards as a social class are estranged from others and have little interest or incentive to meddle in the affairs of mortals technological level is intended to be roughly analogous to the first industrial revolution and the setting is experiencing increased urbanisation and the rise of cities but question im in the early stages of working on a setting for a tabletop campaign and ive hit a bit of a snag as mentioned above id intended for the technology level to be that of the first industrial revolution but im having some difficulty envisaging how such a thing would succeed in this setting theres a number of political forces arrayed against them but i think the tipping point would be the popular outcry against the smog and smoke generated by factories powered by coal a second perhaps even more important concern is that on a meta level i feel having the city inundated with the kinds of pollution london saw would undermine the aesthetic im going for dark smokestacks belching out ominous black smoke should be reserved for evil wizards making their own little isengard so im at a bit of a loss ive considered moving the technology forward a bit to allow for electrical generators and grids which would get rid of the the visible pollution for the most part pushing the power plant away from population centers and handwaving away the in between steps but id feel id be stretching credulity if i also wanted to keep the vibe of mega cities being a new thing also on a very petty note id be losing steam trains and i do enjoy them am i overthinking this or is there an obvious solution im missing is there a way to maintain a bright clean aesthetic without handwaving things and hoping nobody looks too closely edit a couple of clarifications re social landscape and scale of city edit available feedback has helped me greatly narrow down my concerns and has been very helpful thank you all so if no pollution is a non starter is there an alternate power source that would provide a cleaner aesthetic but fulfill the role of coal in powering engines if you take a bright approach in your world and avoid putting the words pollution and ecology it might be just enough in other words dont talk about what you dont want to talk talk about the themes you wish to explore how much do you need to solve it an alternative power source is possible but a lot of coal burning was for actual heat for smelting kilning or glass making john its seeming very unlikely ill be able to avoid widespread pollution which fair enough its a hard ask and one that predates coal considering the feedback i should refine the question on how i can avoid overt visible pollution akin to how natural gas is colourless and odourless but still very much a pollutant is there another power source that could fill the role of coal without being as visibly polluting ill give the question another once over industry is not the issue the first factories were powered by water wheels not coal so you can make your cities a bit cleaner by sticking with this ancient rome for example ground enough grain for over million people using just water mills powered by the water brough in by thier aqueducts they also had water powered saw mills that they used for mass producing plywood and there is no telling how many other things they powered with the water they brought into thier city that said cities were already nasty polluted smoky places long before the industrial revolution the biggest problem is not the coal factories invented a few hundred years ago its all the wood burning stoves and fire places that have been around for millennia if your industrial era city is not a smoky nasty place then its not historically accurate unless your city has a methane pipe system unlike wood or other fossil fuels methane burns cleanly into just co and water with no ashes tars or other waste products so there is no visible or smellable smoke it is also colorless and odorless without modern additives to give it a smell so even if you have some leaking here and there the pollution will not be apparent either by baltimore installed the first piped methane powered street lamp system and by the s you start to see the first gas stoves being produced so this places piped natural gas replacing wood and coal burning well within the bounds of a late industrial era society the downside of methane is that until very recently it was only available as a byproduct of the coal industry meaning that many cities that burned methane in homes also burned coal in thier factories to remedy this it means you need to place your coal powered factories and such outside of town limits or sell the coal to those evil polluted cities and then pipe in the methane byproducts of your coal mining as a fuel for use inside of the city for cooking heating and light which will give you relatively clean air in the city itself these are all very valid points and thank you for bringing them up i had such a myopic focus on coal and smokestacks i completely forgot about the awful state of cities before coal ever took center stage i fear you are quite right in your assessment but ill leave the question open for a couple more hours to see if anyone wants to take a crack at an alternative power source before i mark this as answered once again thank you for your input grimm edited my answer after you accepted it turns out commercial scale methane production has been around for even longer than i realized making it not anachronistic for an industrial era society just not necessarily the norm indeed one of the things that powered the industrial revolution were the laboratories that depended on a good supply of quality raw ingredients coal coal gas oil methane many big cities quickly switched to coal gas or methane when it became available and while the coal gas plants themselves werent exactly clean theres a lot of stuff in coal they got better over time and it was still cleaner than most existing alternatives its just that the pollution was more concentrated city cleaner plant dirtier of course the supply increased demand dyes exploded with coal there may be a bit of misinformation here those dark satanic mills arose almost two centuries after the start of the industrial revolution industrialization began with waterwheels and hydropower was the power source which drove the rise of factories for a very long time london was not typical like at all the smog of london was mostly due to local climatic conditions and the universal use of bad coal for domestic purposes factories did play some part but they were not the dominant factor for example paris with different geographical conditions never came close to london with respect to smog and bad air feudalism is by far the most decentralized political system in human history i am at a loss to imagine anything more decentralized than the high middle ages electricity could have been discovered and used at any point in history at least from the classical age onwards it is a bit of a historical mystery how come we had to wait for the th century they had copper they had zinc they had iron they had acids they had wire there was no material element missing but what i really dont get is the part about cities being a new thing cities are a really really old thing cities came five thousand years before the industrial revolution basically cities exist to support trade thats what they are for without cities you cannot have the economic base where an industrial revolution can arise and about the pollution you may be overthinking it you just cannot avoid pollution in the city not with a pre st century technological base but you do not have to dwell on it to give a practical example one of the most pressing pollution problems which faced th century cities was horse manure london alone had about horses towards the end of the th century and each horse produced about kg of manure per day to say nothing about the smelly liquid waste and the swarms of flies thats tons of manure per day which had to be collected and carted out of the city on the other hand have you ever read a historical or fantasy story or seen a film where the horse waste problem was shown in its gross magnitude no it was carefully placed aside nobody wants to read a story or see a film about the problem of collecting and carting a thousand tons of manure per day janimiettinen for example how important was the king in a feudal kingdom was explained hands on to king john lackland of england at runnymede in for a visual example look at a map of the holy roman empire in the th century each of those countless colored patches is a state notionally subordinated to the emperor but in practice much more independent than a modern member state of the european union janimiettinen yes ok but those legislative and executive powers belonged to the local baron not to the state medieval states did not have any kind of central government in the modern understanding each and every feudal lord was chief justice and chief executive in his or hers lands quiz when did france acquire a uniform legal system nosajimiki in what way athens had a few hundred thousand inhabitants all obeying the same laws all subject to the same set of magistrates etc moreover athens was the central ruling power over a sizeable empire decentralized simply means without a strong center it does not mean democratic or anarchic with regards to electricity until the industrial era they didnt have wire at least not in the quantities and lengths needed to make an electric motor drawing wire by hand is a slow labor intensive process and most ancient wire was used for jewelry not tools you cant avoid pollution just consider that algae and photosynthetic organisms polluted earth so much with their waste gas to seclude anaerobic organisms into remote parts of the planet where oxygen cant easily reach and algae are far away from anything resembling an industrial revolution getting to something closer to our context early bronze age people heavily polluted their environment with the wastes of copper mining increasing the local concentrations of arsenic thanks to the wastes of smelting and again they were far from being an industrial revolution you simply cant produce a lot of something without having also a lot of something else in the form of wastes and polluting agents its the amount in itself that turns the waste into pollution indeed the industrial age became rather unprecedented in how much of the waste was further processed into something useful that might sound weird thinking about modern waste on purpose like plastic packaging fast fashion stupid cars and disposable everything but a lot of the industrial revolution was built on extracting every possible thing out of the resources you had coal was no longer just burned it was separated into coke metallurgy and coal gas lighting heating used to produce dyes and fertilizers sulphuric acid things got progressively cleaner sure horses could be considered more natural but tractors were cleaner though they brought pollution of a different kind and only got cleaner as time went on cars were seen as a wonderful thing that finally eliminates the dirty horses out of big cities and bring much cleaner environment which was true up until the point where the scale exploded beyond anything horses could ever provide and scale is the main thing that ultimately made the industrial revolution dirty a huge increase in population and density in stuff produced and unprecedented scale of warfare if you want a different outcome you need different motivations if you assume a capitalism first approach you should expect similar outcomes to our history you dont have to assume that capitalists are evil its just that they will be more focused on profits and the downsides of pollution will not be changes behavior until it becomes obvious that the downsides are significant widespread and detrimental if on the other hand the people have widespread honest respect for the environment and this is truly considered as a first principle then even those few that dont respect the environment will still take into account environmental impact because the consequences of becoming known as a polluter will be too harsh to ignore even then if some people think they can get away with it they will pollute as a shortcut cheap solution to waste disposal however the widespread pollution of london or rivers that catch fire should be rare due to a few bad actors the short term economic benefits of simple dumping waste to land water or air must be over powered by the bad karma of doing so thus the compulsion to be clean must be strong many people believe that the culture of the native americans was such that they were in balance with nature though certainly not true in a universal sense such a culture would be a plausible basis for such an outcome the widespread pollution of london had little to do with industry in the first place though which was why people didnt see the factories as such a big deal at first when people burn coal and unrefined coal at that in their fireplaces and with the massive amounts of horses everywhere factories that bring jobs and prosperity arent such a big deal the pollution from coal powered factories started being significant as london switched over to coal gas for lighting and heat which were much cleaner other cities tended to avoid coal but wood burning is still pretty awful incidentally rivers that catch fire were caused by those coal gas plants which provided the much cleaner environment they just had a few snags along the way heck one of the things that eliminated huge amounts of waste as weird as it may sound today was the spread of internal combustion engines finally instead of dumping all the waste oil products oil was used exclusively for the production of kerosene for lighting a rather small fraction of the raw material they could be used productively at least and fewer horses if people cared about the waste they wouldnt get there and as for the popular myths about native americans it would be better if they had any basis in truth at all d its even thought that the massive die off of the native population in europe too of course was one of the causes of the little ice age as people stopped burning so much wood and much land returned to wilderness sequestering humongous amounts of carbon dioxide theres no evidence pointing to native americans being any different from europeans in that regard most of the popular culture is either long past european colonization or outright invented out of thin air i suggest that you postulate different sources of fuel for example if there was a unique species of ballon tree that grows over coal deposits or swamps and extracts methane chemically from the coal or decay via the root system this would form havestable sources of methane for your world as another example your world could be rich in magnetite for some reason and the prevalence of magnetic sources led to the discovery of electricity as a power source before coal turbines could be water wind or animal driven if there was some cautionary tale in the recent history of your world which led to a civilization wide adoption of environmental responsibility lest that tragedy repeat could also help reduce the impact of industrialization several other answers have briefly mentioned methane perhaps your worlds industrial revolution is centered around farming and breeding microorganisms that turn farm waste or other organic materials into methane fuel this would also clean up the natural smoke and dirt of a city that burns wood or charcoal for its fuel smoke from indoor fires is a significant cause of health issues in pre industrial or partly industrialized urbanized societies even if the fuel is wood or dung this science article for kids has a good overview of biological anaerobic decay microorganisms cattle farts and non biological mostly volcanoes sources of the methane in our environment though you could make your planet be a bit different https kids frontiersin org articles frym this rather technical article discusses some of the ways that methanogenic archaea can be and are being used to generate methane which is burned for electricity and or purified and compressed into transportation fuel https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc the biggest issue here is how to trigger initial uptake of these technologies we learned to burn coal to smelt iron because there were places in the world where small coal and iron deposits were close to or at the surface and easy to access only once the technology was proven at that level did we start mining more inaccessible deposits at the scale needed to drive a full scale technological society one possible scenario would be clay deposits in bogs where people learned to use the methane from the peat bogs to fire clay objects on the spot this article talks about how some bogs have a clay layer underneath them and others do not though it is mostly focused on using bogs to grow cranberries https www cranberries org exploringcranberries into beneath back html hopefully this gives you some ideas to start from tl dr venice iceland for the win other answers have mentioned the two main sources of pollution in a london like city at the start of the industrial revolution coal wood burnt to in houses and horse manure iceland cleaner energy source burning coal or wood happens for two reasons heating and cooking you can mostly eliminate heating needs by relocating to a hotter area year long and the little coal or wood used for cooking should not be much of an issue provided theres enough wind to disperse it if you do not wish to go for a more tropical climate however another solution is a land with plenty of hot water underground that you can tap into by redirected this hot water into houses you solve the heating issue there are villages in france where houses have used floor heating for a very long time by piping naturally hot water into the floors it really cuts on the heating bill if the water is hot enough as in scalding hot or above c it will be free of any bacteria and may thus be used as is for cooking given that romans were building aqueducts and sewers in the antiquity an early industrial revolution society clear has all the technical know how to pipe hot water from the ground and should hot water not be universally available it would explain why the city sprang up here and not anywhere else its a prime spot to survive cold harsh winters venice cleaner transportation you can eliminate a lot of horse manure issues by switching from land based to canal based transportation a horse or other is nigh required to pull a cart because the cart is so heavy however the same load can be transported by boat fairly easily especially in the absence of current a city ala venice or amsterdam or copenhagen with an array of canals criss crossing it would be more likely to rely on boat transportation than horse drawn transportation at least within city limits combination combining the two will require a specific geographic location thermal hot spots are most likely found in mountainous areas so the city would likely be in the mountains though it may be close to the bottom on the nearby plain canals require a plain and likely a slightly spongy one marshlands close to a source of water be it river or sea a city combining thermal hot spots and canals would thus likely be located close to either river or sea in a flat marshland area with hot water being piped from nearby mountains elon musk i love
