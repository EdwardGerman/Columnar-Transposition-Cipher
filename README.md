## **About**

More details about Columnar Transposition can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Columnar_transposition)
And in particular about CTC [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Columnar_transposition)

### Problel conditions:
There is a text that encode as follows: 
- All letters are converted to lowercase
- All characters except (including 'space' and '\n') letters are removed from the text
At this stage, we get all text in one string
- The resulting string split on pieces same length. 
- This pieces are recorded graduatly in the table one under the other.
- The columns of this table are shuffled
- Then in the same way table graduatly are converted to string.
This string is a encoded text.

**It is necessary**: to restore the original sequence of the text
