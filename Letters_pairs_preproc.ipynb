the seven days of creation in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now the earth was formless and empty with darkness over the surface of the deep and god wind was hovering over the

night there was evening and there was morning a first day p god said let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters and let it divide water from water god made the expanse and divided the water which was under the expanse from the water which was above the expanse and it was so god called the expanse heaven there was evening and there was morning a second day p god said let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place and let the dry land appear and it was so god called the dry land earth and the gathering of the waters he called seas and god saw that it was good god said let the earth yield grass herbs yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind with its seed in it on the earth and it was so the earth yielded grass herbs yielding seed after their kind and trees bearing fruit with its seed in it after their kind and god saw that it was good there was evening and there was morning a third day p god said let there be lights in the expanse of heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be signs for the seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the expanse of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so god made the two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars god set them in the expanse of heaven to give light to the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good there was evening and there was morning a fourth day p god said let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth in the expanse of heaven god created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves with which the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged bird after its kind god saw that it was good god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the birds multiply on the earth there was evening and there was morning a fifth day p god said let the earth produce living creatures after their kind livestock creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind and it was so god made the beasts of the earth after their kind and the livestock after their kind and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind and god saw that it was good god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth god created the man in his image in god image he created him male and female he created them god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth god said behold i have given you every herb yielding seed on the surface of all the earth and every tree bearing fruit yielding seed it will be yours for food to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth in which there is the breath of life i have given every green herb for food and it was so god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good there was evening and there was morning the sixth day p the heavens and the earth were finished and all their legions on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made and he ceased on the seventh day from all his work which he had made god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because in it he ceased from all his work that he had created to do the garden of eden p this is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created on the day the lord god made earth and heaven no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for the lord god had not caused it to rain on the earth and there was no man to till the ground but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground the lord god formed the man from the dust of the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living creature the lord god planted a garden in eden in the east and there he put the man whom he had formed out of the ground the lord god made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food with the tree of life in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil a river goes out of eden to water the garden and from there it parts and becomes four heads the name of the first is pishon that is the one which flows through the whole land of havilah where there is gold the gold of that land is good bdellium is there and lapis lazuli the name of the second river is gihon the one that winds through the whole land of cush the name of the third river is hiddekel the one which flows east of assyria and the fourth river is the euphrates the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to work it and to keep it the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may surely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die the lord god said it is not good for the man to be alone i will make him a fitting helper the lord god formed out of the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them whatever the man called every living creature that was its name the man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field but for the man there was not found a fitting helper the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place he made the rib which the lord god had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she will be called woman ishah for from man ish was she taken therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will join with his wife and they will become one flesh they were both naked the man and his wife yet they were not ashamed now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts which the lord god had made he said to the woman has god really said you shall not eat of any tree of the garden the woman said to the serpent of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may surely eat but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die the serpent said to the woman you will surely not die for god knows that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise she took of its fruit and ate and she gave some to her husband beside her and he ate the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loinclothes they heard the sound of the lord god walking in the garden in the breeze of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden the lord god called to the man and said to him where are you the man said i heard your sound in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and hid myself god said who told you that you were naked have you eaten of the tree that i commanded you not to eat from the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me of the tree and i ate the lord god said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent deceived me and i ate the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are more cursed that all livestock and above every beast of the field on your belly you shall go and you shall eat dust all the days of your life i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring he will bruise your head and you will bruise his heel s to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth in pain will you bear children your longing will be for your husband and he will rule you s to the man he said because you heeded the voice of your wife and ate from the tree of which i commanded you saying you shall not eat of it cursed is the ground because of you in toil you will eat from it all the days of your life it will yield thorns and thistles to you and you will eat the herb of the field by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground for from it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return the man called his wife eve because she was the mother of all that lives the lord god made coats of skins for adam and for his wife and clothed them p the lord god said see the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil now what if he should reach out his hand and take as well of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him out of the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed the cherubs at the east of the garden of eden and the flame of the revolving sword to guard the way to the tree of life cain and abel s now the man had known eve his wife she conceived and gave birth to cain saying i have gotten a man with the lord help again she gave birth to cain brother abel abel became a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground after some years it happened that cain brought an offering to the lord from the fruit of the ground abel too brought from the choice firstlings of his flock and of its fat the lord accepted abel and his offering but cain and his offering he did not accept cain was very angry and his face fell the lord said to cain why are you angry and why has your face fallen surely if you do well there will be lifting up but if you do not do well sin crouches at the door its longing is for you yet you can master it cain said to abel his brother and when they were in the field cain rose up against abel his brother and killed him the lord said to cain where is abel your brother he said i do not know am i my brother keeper the lord said what have you done the voice of your brother blood cries out to me from the ground now you are cursed through the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother blood from your hand when you till the ground it will not yield its strength to you you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth cain said to the lord my punishment is too great to bear for you have driven me out this day from upon the surface of the ground and i must hide from your face i will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth and whoever finds me will kill me the lord said to him therefore whoever slays cain vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold the lord put a mark on cain lest any finding him should strike him cain left the lord presence and dwelt in the land of nod east of eden cain knew his wife and she conceived and gave birth to enoch he became the builder of a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch to enoch was born irad and irad begot mehujael and

dwell in tents with livestock his brother name was jubal who was the father of all who play the lyre and pipe as for zillah she bore tubal cain who forged every instrument of brass and iron tubal cain sister was naamah lamech said to his wives adah and zillah hear my voice you wives of lamech give ear to my speech for i have slain a man for wounding me a young man for bruising me if cain will be avenged seven times then lamech seventy and seven times adam knew his wife again and she bore a son and called him seth for god has given me other seed instead of abel for cain killed him there was also born a son to seth and he named him enosh it was then that men began to call on the name of the lord from adam to noah s this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man he made him in god likeness he created them male and female and blessed them and called their name adam on the day they were created adam lived one hundred and thirty years and begot a son in his

then he died s noah was five hundred years old and noah begot shem ham and japheth now when men began to multiply upon the face of the earth and daughters were born to them the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were goodly and they took themselves women as they chose the lord said my breath will not abide in man forever because he too is flesh his days will be one hundred and twenty years the nephilim were in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god took the daughters of men they bore them children those were the mighty men who were of old men of renown p the lord saw that the evil of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually the lord regretted that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him in his heart the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the surface of the ground from man to cattle to creeping things to the birds of the heavens for i regret that i made

introduction i looked at my notes and i didn t like them i d spent three days at u s robots and might as well have spent them at home with the encyclopedia tellurica susan calvin had been born in the year they said which made her seventy five now everyone knew that appropriately enough u s robot and mechanical men inc was seventy five also since it had been in the year of dr calvin birth that lawrence robertson had first taken out incorporation papers for what eventually became the strangest industrial giant in man history well everyone knew that too at the age of twenty susan calvin had been part of the particular psycho math seminar at which dr alfred lanning of u s robots had demonstrated the first mobile robot to be equipped with a voice it was a large clumsy unbeautiful robot smelling of machine oil and destined for the projected mines on mercury but it could speak and make sense susan said nothing at that seminar took no part in the hectic discussion period that followed she was a frosty girl plain and colorless who protected herself against a world she disliked by a masklike expression and a hypertrophy of intellect but as she watched and listened she felt the stirrings of a cold enthusiasm she obtained her bachelor degree at columbia in and began graduate work in cybernetics all that had been done in the mid twentieth century on calculating machines had been upset by robertson and his positronic brain paths the miles of relays and photocells had given way to the spongy globe of plantinumiridium about the size of a human brain she learned to calculate the parameters necessary to fix the possible variables within the positronic brain to construct brains on paper such that the responses to given stimuli could be accurately predicted in she obtained her ph d and joined united states robots as a robopsychologist becoming the first great practitioner of a new science lawrence robertson was still president of the corporation alfred lanning had become director of research for fifty years she watched the direction of human progress change and leap ahead now she was retiring as much as she ever could at least she was allowing someone else name to be inset upon the door of her office that essentially was what i had i had a long list of her published papers of the patents in her name i had the chronological details of her promotions in short i had her professional vita in full detail but that wasn t what i wanted i needed more than that for my feature articles for interplanetary press much more i told her so dr calvin i said as lushly as possible in the mind of the public you and u s robots are identical your retirement will end an era and you want the human interest angle she didn t smile at me i don t think she ever smiles but her eyes were sharp though not angry i felt her glance slide through me and out my occiput and knew that i was uncommonly transparent to her that everybody was but i said that right human interest out of robots a contradiction no doctor out of you well i ve been called a robot myself surely they ve told you i m not human they had but there was no point in saying so she got up from her chair she wasn t tall and she looked frail i followed her to the window and we looked out the offices and factories of u s robots were a small city spaced and planned it was flattened out like an aerial photograph when i first came here she said i had a little room in a building right about there where the fire house is now she pointed it was torn down before you were born i shared the room with three others i had half a desk we built our robots all in one building output three a week now look at us fifty years i hackneyed is a long time not when you re looking back at them she said you wonder how they vanished so quickly she went back to her desk and sat down she didn t need expression on her face to look sad somehow how old are you she wanted to know thirty two i said then you don t remember a world without robots there was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend now he has creatures to help him stronger creatures than himself more faithful more useful and absolutely devoted to him mankind is no longer alone have you ever thought of it that way i m afraid i haven t may i quote you you may to you a robot is a robot gears and metal electricity and positrons mind and iron human made it necessary human destroyed but you haven t worked with them so you don t know them they re a cleaner better breed than we are i tried to nudge her gently with words we d like to hear some of the things you could tell us get your views on robots the interplanetary press reaches the entire solar system potential audience is three billion dr calvin they ought to know what you could tell them on robots it wasn t necessary to nudge she didn t hear me but she was moving in the right direction they might have known that from the start we sold robots for earth use then before my time it was even of course that was when robots could not talk afterward they became more human and opposition began the labor unions of course naturally opposed robot competition for human jobs and various segments of religious opinion had their superstitious objections it was all quite ridiculous and quite useless and yet there it was i was taking it down verbatim on my pocket recorder trying not to show the knuckle motions of my hand if you practice a bit you can get to the point where you can record accurately without taking the little gadget out of your pocket take the case of robbie she said i never knew him he was dismantled the year before i joined the company hopelessly out of date but i saw the little girl in the museum she stopped but i didn t say anything i let her eyes mist up and her mind travel back she had lots of time to cover i heard about it later and when they called us blasphemers and demon creators i always thought of him robbie was a non vocal robot he couldn t speak he was made and sold in those were the days before extreme specialization so he was sold as a nursemaid as a what as a nursemaid
