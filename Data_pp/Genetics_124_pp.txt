test for independence guidelines for gene nomenclature a glossary g index i preface a note from the authors the science of genetics is less than years old but its accomplishments within that short time have been astonishing gregor mendel first described genes as abstract units of inheritance in his work was ignored and then rediscovered in thomas hunt morgan and his students provided experimental verification of the idea that genes reside within chromosomes during the years by oswald avery and his coworkers had established that genes are made of dna james watson and francis crick published their pathbreaking structure of dna in remarkably less than years later in an international consortium of investigators deciphered the sequence of the billion nucleotides in the human genome twentieth century genetics made it possible to identify individual genes and to understand a great deal about their functions today scientists are able to access the enormous amounts of genetic data generated by the sequencing of many organisms genomes analysis of these data will result in a deeper understanding of the complex molecular interactions within and among vast networks of genes proteins and other molecules that help bring organisms to life finding new methods and tools for analyzing these data will be a significant part of genetics in the twenty first century our sixth edition of genetics from genes to genomes emphasizes both the core concepts of genetics and the cutting edge discoveries modern tools and analytic methods that will keep the science of genetics moving forward the authors of the sixth edition have worked together in revising every chapter in an effort not only to provide the most up to date information but also to provide continuity and the clearest possible explanations of difficult concepts in one voice our focus an integrated approach genetics from genes to genomes represents a new approach to an undergraduate course in genetics it reflects the way we the authors currently view the molecular basis of life we integrate formal genetics the rules by which genes are transmitted molecular genetics the structure of dna and how it directs the structure of proteins digital analysis and genomics recent technologies that allow a comprehensive analysis of the entire gene set and its expression in an organism human genetics how genes contribute to health and diseases including cancer the unity of life forms the synthesis of information from many different organisms into coherent models molecular evolution the molecular mechanisms by which biological systems whole organisms and populations have evolved and diverged the strength of this integrated approach is that students who complete the book will have a strong command of genetics as it is practiced today by both academic and corporate researchers these scientists are rapidly changing our understanding of living organisms including ourselves ultimately this vital research may create the ability to replace or correct detrimental genes those inborn errors of metabolism as researcher archibald garrod called them in as well as the later genetic alterations that lead to the many forms of cancer the genetic way of thinking modern genetics is a molecular level science but an understanding of its origins and the discovery of its principles is a necessary context to encourage a genetic way of thinking we begin the book by reviewing mendels principles and the chromosomal basis of inheritance from the outset however we aim to integrate organism level genetics with fundamental molecular mechanisms chapter presents the foundation of this integration by summarizing the main biological themes we explore in chapter we tie mendels studies of pea trait inheritance to the actions of enzymes that determine whether a pea is round or wrinkled yellow or green etc in the same chapter we point to the relatedness of the patterns of heredity in all organisms chapters cover extensions to mendel the chromosome theory of inheritance and the fundamentals of gene linkage and mapping starting in chapter we focus on the physical characteristics of dna on mutations and on how dna encodes copies and transmits biological information beginning in chapter we move into the digital revolution in dna analysis with a look at modern genetics techniques including gene cloning pcr microarrays and high throughput genome sequencing we explore how bioinformatics an emergent analytical tool can aid in discovery of genome features this section concludes in chapter with case studies leading to the discovery of human disease genes the understanding of molecular and computer based techniques carries into our discussion of chromosome specifics in chapters and also informs our analysis of gene regulation in chapters and chapter describes the most recent technology that scientists can use to manipulate genomes at will for research and practical purposes including gene therapy chapter describes the use of genetic tools at the molecular level to uncover the complex interactions of eukaryotic development in chapter we explain how our understanding of genetics and the development of molecular genetic technologies is enabling us to comprehend cancer and in some cases to cure it chapters and cover population genetics with a view of how molecular tools have provided information on species relatedness and on genome changes at the molecular level over time in addition we explain how bioinformatics can be combined with population genetics to understand inheritance of complex traits and to trace human ancestry throughout our book we present the scientific reasoning of some of the ingenious researchers of the field from mendel to watson and crick to the collaborators on the human genome project we hope student readers will see that genetics is not simply a set of data and facts but also a human endeavor that relies on contributions from exceptional individuals student friendly features as digital components of the text become more and more crucial we are very excited that janice fischer a textbook author is taking on a dual role as digital editor janice will ensure the important consistency between text and digital we have taken great pains to help the student make the leap to a deeper understanding of genetics numerous features of this book were developed with that goal in mind one voice genetics genes to genomes has a friendly engaging reading style that helps students master the concepts throughout this book the writing style provides the student with the focus and continuity required to make the book successful in the classroom visualizing genetics the highly specialized art program developed for this book integrates photos and line art in a manner that provides the most engaging visual presentation of genetics available our feature figure illustrations break down complex processes into step by step illustrations that lead to greater student understanding all illustrations are rendered with a consistent color theme for example all presentations of phosphate groups are the same color as are all presentations of mrna accessibility our intention is to bring cutting edge content to the student level a number of more complex illustrations are revised and segmented to help the student follow the process legends have been streamlined to highlight only the most important ideas and throughout the book topics and examples have been chosen to focus on the most critical information problem solving developing strong problem solving skills is vital for every genetics student the authors have carefully created problem sets at the end of each chapter that allow students to improve upon their problem solving ability solved problems these cover topical material with complete answers provide insight into the step by step process of problem solving review problems more than questions involving a variety of levels of difficulty that develop excellent problem solving skills the problems are organized by chapter section and in order of increasing difficulty within each section for ease of use by instructors and students the companion online study guide and solutions manual completely revised for the th edition by michael goldberg and janice fischer provides detailed analysis of strategies to solve all of the end of chapter problems i the following figure shows a screen shot from the ucsc genome browser focusing on a region of the human genome encoding a gene called mfap l note hg refers to version of the human genome refseq if you do not remember how the browser represents the genome refer to the key at the bottom of fig source university of california genome project https genome ucsc edu a describe in approximate terms the genomic location of mfap l b is the gene transcribed in the direction from the centromere to telomere or from the telomere tocentromere c how many alternative splice forms of mfap l mrna are indicated by the data b the arrows within the introns of the gene show that the direction of transcription is from the telomere of q toward the centromere of chromosome c the data indicate four alternatively spliced forms of the mrna in the following parts we list these as a to d from top to bottom d the data suggest two promoters one is roughly at position and allows the transcription of a primary rna alternatively spliced to produce mrnas b and d the other is roughly at position and leads to the transcription of a primary rna alternatively spliced to generate mrnas a and c e the data indicate that the mfap gene can encode two different but closely related proteins mrnas a b and c all encode the same protein mrna d a slightly larger protein that includes at its n terminus additional amino acids not found in the other protein otherwise these two proteins appear to be the same the orf that encodes the a b c protein form is about bp long a rough estimate this corresponds to about amino acids the d protein is about amino acids longer ii two parents from southeast asia have a stillborn changes in the th edition a chapter by chapter

chapter outline creating transgenic organisms uses of transgenic organisms targeted mutagenesis human gene therapy learning objectives learning objectives appear before each section and are carefully written to clearly outline expectations uses of transgenic organisms learning objectives describe how transgenes can clarify which gene causes a mutant phenotype summarize the use of transgene reporter constructs in gene expression studies discuss examples of how transgenic organisms serve to produce proteins needed for human health list examples of gm organisms and discuss the pros and cons of their production explain the use of transgenic animals to model gain of function genetic diseases in humans essential concepts a wild type transgene can be inserted into an embryo homozygous for a recessive mutant allele if the normal phenotype is restored then the transgene identifies the gene that was mutated the creation of reporter constructs allows easy detection of when and in which tissues a gene is turned on or turned off in eukaryotes transgenic organisms produce medically important human proteins including insulin blood clotting factors and erythropoietin transgenic crop plants can potentially make ingestible vaccines gm soybeans are resistant to the weed killer glyphosate many crops such as corn soybean canola and cotton have been genetically modified to express bt protein which discourages insect predation adding a transgene that carries a disease causing gainof function allele to a nonhuman animal model allows researchers to observe disease progression and to test possible therapeutic interventions essential concepts after each section the most relevant points of content are now provided in concise bulleted statements to reinforce crucial concepts and learning objectives for students manipulation of the genome is the basis for many of the experimental strategies we will describe in chapter where we discuss how genetic analysis has been a crucial tool in unraveling the biochemical pathways of development the process by which a single celled zygote becomes a complex multicellular organism transgenic technology is key to cloning the genes

for students new exciting revised content every chapter of the sixth edition has been revised and modernized significantly as compared with the fifth edition more than new figures and tables were created and more than were revised more than new end of chapter problems were written and many more revised for clarity the entire solutions manual and study guide was updated corrected and revised by michael goldberg and janice fischer several new fast forward genetics and society and tools of genetics boxes covering modern topics were created for breadth and clarity chapter in the th edition was split into two separate chapters in the th edition chapter digital analysis of dna and chapter genome annotation figure one site specific recombination mechanism the cre and flp enzymes discussed in the text function as shown the red and blue target dna sequences are identical to each other but are represented in different colors for clarity these targets are embedded in different dna molecules black and gray dots the subunits of the recombinase tetramer are yellow ovals this enzyme catalyzes all steps of the reaction black triangles are sites where recombinase cleaves single stranded dna note that resolution of the holliday junction intermediate involves cleavage of the blue and red dna strands that were not cleaved initially genome editing by crispr cas the sgrna sequence is designed to bring the cas endonuclease to a specific target in the genome repair after cas cleavage can result in a knockout or a knockin depending on whether or not a dna fragment suitable for homologous recombination is introduced nhej nonhomologous end joining visualizing x chromosome inactivation in transgenic mice scientists have recently used molecular techniques and transgenic technology similar to that described in the earlier fast forward box transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor to visualize the pattern of x chromosome inactivation in mice the researchers generated xx mice containing two different transgenes in this case genes from a different species one of these transgenes was a jellyfish gene that specifies green fluorescent protein gfp the other was a gene from red coral that makes red fluorescent protein rfp fig a in the xx mice the gfp gene is located on the x chromosome from the mother and the rfp gene resides on the x chromosome from the father clonal patches of cells are either green or red depending on which x chromosome was turned into a barr body in the original cell that established the patch fig b different xx mice display different green and red patchwork patterns providing a clear demonstration of the random nature of x chromosome inactivation the patchwork patterns reflect the cellular memory of which x chromosome was inactivated in the founder cell for each clonal patch geneticists currently use these transgenic mice to decipher the genetic details of how cells remember which x to inactivate after each cell division fa s t f o r wa r d visualizing x chromosome inactivation in transgenic mice figure b heart cells of a transgenic mouse reveal a clonal patchwork of x inactivation patches of red or green cells represent cellular descendants of the founders that randomly inactivated one of their x chromosomes figure a cells of transgenic mice glow either green or red in response to x chromosome inactivation the mouse carries a green gfp transgene inserted in the maternal x chromosome xm and a red rfp transgene in the paternal x chromosome xp cells in which xp is inactivated top glow green cells glow red bottom when xm is inactivated fast forward this feature is one of the methods used to integrate the mendelian principles introduced early in the content with the molecular content that will follow how bacteria vaccinate themselves against viral infections with crispr cas researchers discovered clustered sequence repeats crisprs in bacterial genomes as early as when in some of these sequences were found to originate from bacteriophage genomes several astute scientists speculated that crisprs might mediate a viral immunity system in bacteria these ideas were largely ignored for several more years until the mechanism of resistance became clarified and finally in the so called crispr craze reached its full bloom when researchers including feng zhang jennifer doudna and emmanuelle charpentier developed methods to adapt this viral immunity system to engineer genomes in bacterial cells and in eukaryotic organisms at the crispr locus of bacterial genomes short direct repeats are interrupted at regular intervals by unique spacer sequences fig a the spacer sequences are fragments of bacteriophage genomes captured by the host cell and integrated into the host genome by the action of two bacterially encoded cas proteins cas and cas the repeats within the crispr arrays are added by these endonucleolytic enzymes during the capture and integration process viral immunity results from steps that begin with transcription of the crispr array into long rna molecules called pre crrnas that are processed into short nt socalled crispr rnas crrnas in the bacterial species tools of genetics essays current readings explain various techniques and tools used by geneticists including examples of applications in biology and medicine the human microbiome project established in and funded by the u s national institutes of health the human microbiome project hmp fig a is one of several international consortia aiming to understand the complex relationship between our bodies and the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit them the hmp has already achieved its first goal of describing the diversity of the organisms that make up the human microbiome investigators analyzed the microbial metagenomes located at several different sites in the bodies of more than people from around the globe these studies focused on the sequence of the gene encoding the s rrna of the ribosomal small subunit of these bacteria because these sequences diverge substantially in different bacterial species and thus serve as markers for those species the results showed that a single person can harbor up to different bacterial species but people vary widely in the types of bacteria that make up their microbiome thus it appears that worldwide more than different bacterial species colonize human bodies the researchers of the hmp have already sequenced the complete genomes of many of these kinds of bacteria the second phase of the hmp began in and is aimed ultimately at determining whether changes in the microbiome are the causes or effects of diseases or other important traits in humans diseases potentially linked to the microbiome include cancer acne psoriasis diabetes obesity and inflammatory bowel disease some investigators have suggested that the composition of microbiomes could also influence the mental health of their hosts the first step in these studies will be to establish whether statistical correlations exist between specific kinds of microbial communities and disease states as one example one hmp phase ii project currently underway is an analysis of vaginal host cells and microbes during pregnancy approximately pregnant women will be studied and their birth outcomes recorded the goal of this project is to determine if changes in the microbiome correlate with premature birth or other complications of pregnancy of course the existence of any correlations found between microbiomes and disease does not prove cause or effect but even if bacteria correlated with a disease state do not cause the disease the existence of the correlation could be useful as a way to diagnose certain conditions nevertheless the most an effect one method is to investigate in detail how the biological properties of the microbiome and the host might be changed by the interactions of bacteria and the humans they colonize thus scientists will characterize whether and how the transcriptomes and proteomes of the bacteria and human cells are changed by bacterial colonization of human organs these studies will further delve into metabolomics characterizing metabolites in the human bloodstream a second and even more powerful method for establishing the cause and effect of microbiome changes is the use of germ free mice raised in sterile environments surprisingly germ free mice can survive although they are not normal they have altered immune systems poor skin and they need to eat more calories than do normal mice to maintain a normal body weight researchers can populate germ free mice with a single bacterial species or a complex microbial community and thus determine how microbiomes influence physiological states problem at the end of this chapter will allow you to explore this approach by discussing an experiment recently performed with germ free mice that asks if the microbiome plays a causal role in obesity if microbial communities indeed contribute to disease states in humans then future treatments might aim to alter resident microbiomes thus the flip side of the hmp is to visualizing genetics full color illustrations and photographs bring the printed word to life these visual reinforcements support and further clarify the topics discussed throughout the text the watson and c the double helix structure of dna a watson and crick took the known facts about dnas chemical composition and its physical arrangement in space and constructed a wire frame model that could explain the molecules function b in the model two dna chains spiral around an axis with the sugar phosphate backbones on the outside and flat pairs of bases meeting in the middle one chain runs to upward while the other runs in the opposite direction of to downward in short the two chains are antiparallel the two chains wrap around each other once every base pairs or once every the result is a double helix that looks like a twisted ladder with the two spiraling structural members composed of sugarphosphate backbones and the perpendicular rungs consisting of base pairs c in a space filling representation of the model the overall shape is that of a grooved cylinder with a diameter of the backbones spiral around the axis of the double helix like threads on a screw because two backbones exist there are two threads and these two threads are vertically displaced from each other this displacement of the backbones generates two grooves one the major groove much wider than the other the minor groove the two chains of the double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs a t and g c the spatial requirements of the double helix require that each base pair must consist of one small pyrimidine and one large purine and even then only for the particular pairings of a t and g c in contrast a c and g t pairs do not fit well and cannot easily form hydrogen bonds although any one nucleotide pair forms only two or three hydrogen bonds the sum of these connections between successive base pairs in a long dna molecule composed of thousands of nucleotides is a key to the molecules great chemical stability feature figures special multipage spreads integrate line art photos and text to summarize in detail important genetic concepts pour heated molten agarose into a clear acrylic plate to which a comb has been attached with clamps allow the agarose to cool and harden remove the comb shallow wells will be left in the gel remove the gel from the acrylic plate and transfer it to a tank containing a bu ered solution use a micropipette to load a di erent dna sample into each well of the gel each sample contains a blue dye to make it easier to see one sample should contain dna molecules of known length to serve as size markers expose the gel to ultraviolet uv light dna molecules will fluoresce as orange bands because the ethidium bromide bound to the dna absorbs uv photons and gives o photons in the visible red range you can estimate the size of the dna molecules in the unknown samples by comparing their migration in the gel with that of the size markers standards in the lane at the left the tank contains electrode wires placed along each end of the gel attach these electrodes to a power supply when you switch on the current the negatively charged dna molecules in each sample migrate toward the end of the box along the paths lanes shown by the orange arrows smaller dna molecules will move faster toward the end than larger dna molecules separating dna molecules according to their size by agarose gel electrophoresis to prepare an agarose gel with wells for samples you pour the gel as shown in step you then transfer the gel to a tank containing a buffered solution with ions that allow current to flow and load dna samples in the wells step you then connect the gel tank to a power supply and allow electrophoresis to run from to hours depending on the dna size and the voltage step after incubating the gel with the fluorescent dye ethidium bromide step you then expose the gel to uv light step dna molecules will appear as orange bands because they bind to the fluorescent dye step shows actual results from gel electrophoresis because black and white film was used dna appears white rather than orange the standard lane at left has dna fragments of known sizes human genomic dna was cut with ecori in lane a and with rsai in lane b smears containing hundreds of thousands of fragments are produced with an average size of about kb for ecori and bp for rsai in c d and e the chromosome of bacteriophage was cut with hindiii ecori and rsai respectively the sizes of the fragments in any one lane add up to kb the size of the viral genome in f g and h plasmid dna of total length kb was cut with the same three enzymes note that the larger the genome analyzed the more fragments are produced moreover the more bases in the restriction enzyme recognition site the larger is the average size of the fragments produced remove the gel from the tank incubate in a solution containing ethidium bromide which binds to dna then wash with water to remove excess dye from the gel expose the gel to ultraviolet uv light dna molecules will fluoresce as orange bands because the ethidium bromide bound to the dna absorbs uv photons and gives o photons in the visible red range you can estimate the size of the dna molecules in the unknown samples by comparing their migration in the gel with that of the size markers standards in the lane at the left process figures step by step descriptions allow

the basic differences of often confusing principles genomic dna from a womans blood cells is pcr amplified by a single pair of primers representing a unique locus in the genome the pcr products are then sequenced by the sanger method using one of the pcr primers as a sequencing primer the following figure shows a trace of just part of the sequence read in an f hybrid plant the allele for round peas r is found on one chromosome and the allele for wrinkled peas r is on the homologous chromosome the pairing between the two homologous chromosomes during prophase through metaphase of meiosis i makes sure that the homologs will separate to opposite spindle poles during anaphase i at the end of meiosis ii two types of gametes have been produced half have r and half have r but no gametes have both alleles thus the separation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis i corresponds to the segregation of alleles as the punnett square shows fertilization of r and r eggs with the same proportion of r and r sperm leads to mendels ratio in the f generation one pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed shape alleles r and r a second pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed color alleles y and y each homologous pair aligns at random at the metaphase plate during meiosis i independently of the other homologous pair thus two equally likely configurations are possible for the migration of any two chromosome pairs toward the poles during anaphase i as a result a dihybrid individual will generate four equally likely types of gametes with regard to the two traits in question the punnett square affirms that independent assortment of traits carried by nonhomologous chromosomes produces mendels ratio what kind of polymorphism is most likely represented b with your answer to part a in mind determine the womans genotype at this locus indicate all nucleotides that can be read from both alleles and their to orientation c what kind of molecular event was likely to have generated this polymorphism d how would you know exactly where in the genome this locus is found e what is another way in which you could analyze the pcr products to genotype this locus f suppose you wanted to genotype this locus based on single molecule dna sequencing of whole genomes as shown in fig would a single read suffice for genotyping the locus by this alternative method answer to solve this problem you need to understand that pcr will simultaneously amplify both copies of a locus one on the maternally derived chromosome and one on the paternally derived chromosome as long as the primer can hybridize to both homologs as is usually the case the dna sequence trace has two nucleotides at several positions this fact indicates that the woman must be a heterozygote and that the pcr is amplifying both alleles of the locus a notice that both alleles contain multiple repeats of the dinucleotide ca the most likely explanation for the polymorphism is therefore that the locus contains an ssr polymorphism whose alleles have different numbers of ca repeats one allele has six repeats the second allele must have more ca units b writing out the first nucleotides of both alleles is straightforward if the assumption in part a is correct then one allele should have more than six ca repeats the trace shows evidence for two additional ca repeats in one allele at positions for a total of eight ca repeats you can then determine the nucleotides beyond the repeats in the shorter allele by subtracting caca from positions the remaining peaks at these positions correspond to atgt note that atgt can also be found in the longer allele but now at nucleotides just past the two additional caca repeats you can determine the last four nucleotides in the shorter allele by subtracting atgt from positions revealing tagg the sequences of the two alleles of this ssr locus indicating only one strand of dna each are thus allele ggcacacacacacaatgttagg allele ggcacacacacacacacaatgt c the mechanism thought to be responsible for most ssr polymorphisms is stuttering of dna polymerase during dna replication solving genetics problems the best way for students to assess and increase their understanding of genetics is to practice through problems found at the end of each chapter problem sets assist students in evaluating their grasp of key concepts and allow them to apply what they have learned to real life issues review problems problems are organized by chapter section and in order of increasing difficulty to help students develop strong problem solving skills the answers to select

genetics from genes to genomes justin wyatt and michelle vogler for their support mandy clark for her organizational skills and tireless work to tie up all loose ends and vicki krug and the entire production team for their careful attention to detail and ability to move the schedule along genetics the study of biological information information can be stored in many ways including the patterns of letters and words in books and the sequence of nucleotides in dna molecules genetics the science of heredity is at its core the study of biological information all living organisms from single celled bacteria and protozoa to multicellular plants and animals must store and use vast quantities of information to develop survive and reproduce in their environments fig geneticists examine how organisms use biological information during their lifetimes and pass it on to their progeny this book introduces you to the field of genetics as currently practiced in the early twenty first century several broad themes recur throughout this presentation first we know that biological information is encoded in dna and that the proteins responsible for an organisms many functions are built from this code second we have found that all living forms are related at the molecular level with the aid of high speed computers and other technologies we can now study genomes at the level of dna sequence these new methods have revealed that genomes have a modular construction that has allowed rapid evolution of complexity finally our focus in this book is on human genetics and the application of genetic discoveries to human problems figure the biological information in dna generates an enormous diversity of living organisms dna lifes fundamental information molecule learning objectives relate the structure of dna to its function differentiate between a chromosome dna a gene a base pair and a protein the process of evolution the change in traits of groups of organisms over time has taken close to billion years to generate the amazing mechanisms for storing replicating expressing and diversifying biological information seen in organisms now inhabiting the earth the linear dna molecule stores biological information in units known as nucleotides within each dna molecule the sequence of the four letters of the dna alphabet g c a and t specify which proteins an organism will make as well as when and where protein synthesis will occur the letters refer to the bases guanine cytosine adenine and thymine that are components of the nucleotide building blocks of dna the dna molecule itself is a double strand of nucleotides carrying complementary g c or a t base pairs fig these complementary base pairs bind together through hydrogen bonds the molecular complementarity of doublestranded dna is its most important property and the key to understanding how dna functions figure the biological information in dna generates an enormous diversity of living organisms a

humans figure complementary base pairs are a key feature of the dna molecule a single strand of dna is composed of nucleotide subunits each consisting of a deoxyribose sugar white pentagons a phosphate yellow circles and one of four nitrogenous bases adenine thymine cytosine or guanine designated as lavender or green as ts cs or gs hydrogen bonds dotted lines enable a to associate tightly with t and c to associate tightly with g thus the two strands are complementary to each other the arrows labeled to show that the strands have opposite orientations although the dna molecule is three dimensional most of its information is one dimensional and digital the information is one dimensional because it is encoded as a specific sequence of letters along the length of the molecule it is digital because each unit of information one of the four letters of the dna alphabet is discrete because genetic information is digital it can be stored as readily in a computer memory as in a dna molecule indeed the combined power of dna sequencers computers and dna synthesizers makes it possible to store interpret replicate and transmit genetic information electronically from one place to another anywhere on the planet the dna regions that encode proteins are called genes just as the limited number of letters in a written alphabet places no restrictions on the stories one can tell so too the limited number of letters in the genetic code alphabet places no restrictions on the kinds of proteins and thus the kinds of organisms genetic information can define within the cells of an organism dna molecules carrying the genes are assembled into chromosomes organized structures containing dna and proteins that package and manage the storage duplication expression and evolution of dna fig the dna within the entire collection of chromosomes in each cell of an organism is its genome human cells for example contain distinct kinds of chromosomes carrying approximately base pairs and roughly genes the amount of information that can be encoded in this size genome is equivalent to million pages of text containing words per page with each letter corresponding to one base pair to appreciate the long journey from a finite amount of genetic information easily storable on a computer disk to the production of a human being we next must examine proteins the primary molecules that determine how complex systems of cells tissues and organisms function essential concepts dna a double stranded macromolecule composed of four nucleotides is the repository of genetic information dna is organized into chromosomes of different types in humans that collectively constitute an organisms genome the human genome contains about genes most of which encode proteins proteins the functional molecules of life processes learning objectives compare the chemical structures of dna and proteins differentiate between the functions of dna and the functions of proteins although no single characteristic distinguishes living organisms from inanimate matter you would have little trouble deciding which entities in a group of objects are alive over time these living organisms governed by the laws of physics and chemistry as well as a genetic program would be able to reproduce themselves most of the organisms would also have an elaborate and complicated structure that would change over time sometimes drastically as when an insect larva metamorphoses into an adult yet another characteristic of life is the ability to move animals swim fly walk or run while plants grow toward or away from light still another characteristic is the capacity to adapt selectively to the environment finally a key characteristic of living organisms is the ability to use sources of energy and matter to grow that is the ability to convert foreign material into their own body parts the chemical and physical reactions that carry out these conversions are known as metabolism most properties of living organisms arise ultimately from the class of molecules known as proteins large polymers composed of hundreds to thousands of amino acid subunits strung together in long chains each chain folds into a specific three dimensional conformation dictated by the sequence of its amino acids fig most proteins are composed of different amino acids the information in the dna of genes dictates via a genetic code the order of amino acids in a protein molecule you can think of proteins as constructed from a set of different kinds of snap beads distinguished by color and shape if you were to arrange the beads in any order make strings of a thousand beads each and then fold or twist the chains into shapes dictated by the order of their beads you would be able to make a nearly infinite number of different three dimensional shapes the astonishing diversity of three dimensional protein structures generates the extraordinary diversity of protein functions that is the basis of each organisms complex and adaptive behavior fig b and c the structure and shape of the hemoglobin protein for example allow it to transport oxygen in the bloodstream and release it to the tissues in contrast lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that converts lactate to pyruvate an important step in producing cellular energy most of the properties associated with life emerge from the constellation of protein molecules that an organism synthesizes according to instructions contained in its dna essential concepts proteins are responsible for most biological functions of cells and organisms a protein is a macromolecule consisting of amino acids linked in a linear sequence the sequences of amino acids in proteins are encoded by genes within the dna figure proteins are polymers of amino acids that fold in three dimensions a structural formulas for two amino acids alanine and tyrosine all amino acids have a basic amino group nh green at one end and an acidic carboxyl group cooh blue at the other the specific side chain red determines the amino acids chemical properties b the amino acid sequences of two different human proteins the chain of hemoglobin green and the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase purple c the different amino acid sequences of these proteins dictate different threedimensional shapes the specific sequence of amino acids in a chain determines the precise three dimensional shape of the protein molecular similarities of all life forms learning objective summarize the molecular evidence for the common origin of living organisms the evolution of biological information is a fascinating story spanning the billion years of earths history many biologists think that rna was the first informationprocessing molecule to appear very similar to dna rna molecules are also composed of four subunits the bases g c a and u for uracil which replaces the t of dna like dna rna has the capacity to store replicate and express information like proteins rna can fold in three dimensions to produce molecules capable of catalyzing the chemistry of life in fact you will learn that the ultimate function of some genes is to encode rna molecules instead of proteins rna molecules however are intrinsically unstable thus it is probable that the more stable dna took over the linear information storage and replication functions of rna while proteins with their far greater capacity for diversity preempted in large part the functions derived from rnas three dimensional folding with this division of labor rna became primarily an intermediary in converting the information in dna into the sequence of amino acids in protein fig a the separation that placed information storage in dna and biological function mainly in proteins was so successful that all known organisms alive today descend from the first organisms that happened upon this molecular specialization the evidence for the common origin of all living forms is present in their dna sequences all living organisms use essentially the same genetic code in which various triplet groupings of the four letters of the dna and rna alphabets encode the letters of the amino acid alphabet fig b figure rna is an intermediary in the conversion of dna information into protein via the genetic code a the linear bases of dna are copied through molecular complementarity into the linear bases of rna the bases of rna are read three at a time that is as triplets to encode the amino acid subunits of proteins b the genetic code dictionary specifies the relationship between rna triplets and the amino acid subunits of proteins figure comparisons of gene products in different species provide evidence for the relatedness of living organisms this chart shows the amino acid sequence for equivalent portions of the cytochrome c protein in six species saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast arabidopsis thaliana a weedlike flowering plant caenorhabditis elegans a nematode drosophila melanogaster the fruit fly mus musculus the house mouse and homo sapiens humans consult fig b for the key to amino acid names the relatedness of all living organisms is also evident from comparisons of genes with similar functions in very different organisms a striking similarity exists between the genes for many corresponding proteins in bacteria yeast plants worms flies mice and humans for example most of the amino acids in the cytochrome c proteins of diverse species are identical to each other fig indicating that these proteins all derived from a common ancestral protein it is also important to note that some amino acids in these various cytochrome c proteins are different the reason is that different mutations that is changes in nucleotide pairs can occur when genes are passed from one generation of an organism to the next the accumulation of these mutations in genomes is the main driving force of evolution despite the occurrence of mutations that alter dna and thus protein sequences it is often possible to place a gene from one organism into the genome of a very different organism and see it function normally in the new environment human genes that help regulate cell division for example can replace related genes in yeast and enable the yeast cells to function normally one of the most striking examples of relatedness at this level of biological information was uncovered in studies of eye development both insects and vertebrates including humans have eyes but they are of very different types fig biologists had long assumed that the evolution of eyes occurred independently and in many evolution textbooks eyes were used as an example of convergent evolution in which structurally unrelated but functionally analogous organs emerge in different species as a result of natural selection studies of a gene called pax have turned this view upside down mutations in the pax gene lead to a failure of eye development in both people and mice and molecular studies have suggested that pax might play a central role in the initiation of eye development in all vertebrates remarkably when the human pax gene is expressed in cells along the surface of the fruit fly body it induces numerous little eyes to develop there it turns out that fruit flies also have a gene specifying a protein whose amino acid sequence is distantly but clearly related to that of the protein specified by human pax and furthermore certain mutations in the fly gene result in animals lacking eyes taken together these results demonstrate that during million years of divergent evolution an ancestral gene that served as the main control switch for initiating eye development accumulated different mutations in the lineages leading to people and fruit flies but the gene still serves the same function in both species the usefulness of the relatedness and unity at all levels of biological information cannot be overstated it means that in many cases the experimental manipulation of organisms known as model organisms can shed light on gene functions in humans if genes similar to human genes function in simple model organisms such as fruit flies or bacteria scientists can determine gene function and regulation in these experimentally manipulable organisms and bring these insights to an understanding of the human organism essential concepts living organisms exhibit marked similarities at the molecular level in the ways they use dna and rna to make proteins certain genes have persisted throughout the evolution of widely divergent species figure the eyes of insects and humans have a common ancestor a a fly eye and b a human eye figure how genes arise by duplication and divergence ancestral gene a contains exons green red and purple separated by introns in blue gene a is duplicated to create two copies that are originally identical but mutations in either or both other colors cause the copies to diverge additional rounds of duplication and divergence create a family of related genes the modular construction of genomes learning objectives describe mechanisms by which new genes could arise explain how regulation of gene expression can alter gene function we have seen that roughly genes direct human growth and development how did such complexity arise recent technical advances have enabled researchers to complete structural analyses of the entire genome of many organisms the information obtained reveals that gene families have arisen by duplication of a primordial gene after duplication mutations may cause the two copies to diverge from each other fig in both humans and chimpanzees for example four different genes produce different rhodopsin proteins that are expressed in photoreceptors of distinct retinal cells each of these proteins functions in a slightly different way so that four kinds of retinal cells respond to light of different wavelengths and intensities resulting in color vision the four rhodopsin genes arose from a single primordial gene by several duplications followed by slight divergences in structure duplication followed by divergence underlies the evolution of new genes with new functions this principle appears to have been built into the genome structure of all multicellular organisms the protein coding region of most genes is subdivided into as many as or more small pieces called exons separated by dna that does not code for protein called introns as shown in fig this modular construction facilitates the rearrangement of different modules from different genes to create new combinations during evolution it is likely that this process of modular reassortment facilitated the rapid diversification of living forms about million years ago see fig the tremendous advantage of the duplication and divergence of existing pieces of genetic information is evident in the history of lifes evolution table prokaryotic cells such as bacteria which do not have a membrane bounded nucleus evolved about billion years ago eukaryotic cells such as algae which have a membrane bounded nucleus emerged around billion years ago and multicellular eukaryotic organisms appeared million years ago then about million years ago within the relatively short evolutionary time of roughly million years known as the cambrian explosion the multicellular life forms diverged into a bewildering array of organisms including primitive vertebrates figure two winged and four winged flies geneticists converted a contemporary normal two winged fly to a four winged insect resembling the flys evolutionary antecedent they accomplished this by mutating a key element in the flys regulatory network note the club shaped halteres arrows behind the wings of the fly at the top both edward lewis california institute of technology a fascinating question is how could the multicellular forms achieve such enormous diversity in only million years the answer lies in part in the hierarchic organization of the information encoded in chromosomes exons are arranged into genes genes duplicate and diverge to generate gene families and gene families sometimes rapidly expand to gene superfamilies containing hundreds of related genes in both mouse and human adults for example the immune system is encoded by a gene superfamily composed of hundreds of closely related but slightly divergent genes with the emergence of each successively larger informational unit evolution gains the ability to duplicate increasingly complex informational modules through single genetic events probably even more important for the evolution of complexity is the rapid change of regulatory networks that specify how genes behave that is when where and to what degree they are expressed during development for example the two winged fly evolved from a four winged ancestor not because of changes in gene encoded structural proteins but rather because of a rewiring of the regulatory network which converted one pair of wings into two small balancing organs known as halteres fig essential concepts gene duplication followed by the divergence of copies is one explanation for how new functions evolve the reshuffling of exons in eukaryotes provides another mechanism for the rapid diversification of genomes changes in dna that affect gene regulation where when and to what degree genes are expressed also generate evolutionary change modern genetic techniques learning objectives explain how advances in technology have accelerated the analysis of genomes compare the knowledge obtained from genetic dissection and from genome sequencing discuss how genome sequence information can be used to treat or cure diseases the complexity of living systems has developed over billion years from the continuous amplification and refinement of genetic information the simplest bacterial cells contain about genes that interact in complex networks yeast cells the simplest eukaryotic cells contain about genes nematodes roundworms contain about genes and fruit flies contain roughly genes humans have approximately genes surprisingly the flowering plant arabidopsis has as many and the zebrafish d rerio has even more fig each of these organisms has provided valuable insights into aspects of biology that are conserved among all organisms as well as other phenomena that are species specific genetic dissection of model organisms reveals the working of biological processes model organisms including bacteria yeast nematodes fruit flies arabidopsis zebrafish and mice are extremely valuable to researchers who can use these organisms to analyze the complexity of a genome piece by piece the logic used in genetic dissection is quite simple inactivate a gene in a model organism and observe the consequences for example the loss of a gene for visual pigment produces fruit flies with white eyes instead of eyes of the normal red color one can thus conclude that the protein product of this gene plays a key role in eye pigmentation from their study of model organisms geneticists are amassing a detailed picture of the complexity of living systems whole genome sequencing can identify mutant genes that cause disease a complementary way to study an organisms genetic complexity is to look not just at one gene at a time but rather at the genome as a whole the new tools of genomics particularly high throughput dna sequencers have the capacity to analyze all the genes of any living thing in fact the complete nucleotide sequences of representative genomes of the model species listed above as well as of humans have all been determined the first draft of the human genome sequence announced by the human genome project in cost billion and took over years to produce since then rapid advances in genome sequencing technology have made it possible in to determine the genome sequence of an individual in just a few days for about alongside the advances in dna sequencing technology have been the development of computer algorithms to analyze the sequence data and the establishment of online databases that catalog the differences in individual genome sequences no example better illustrates the power of genome sequencing technology than its use in the identification of gene mutations that cause human genetic diseases for diseases that result from mutation of a single gene the gene responsible often may be identified by determining the genome sequence of just a few people or sometimes even that of a single individual in the case shown in fig a geneticists analyzed whole genome sequences to find a gene mutation underlying a rare brain malformation disease called microcephaly the inheritance pattern observed for microcephaly indicated that it is a so called recessive disease meaning that diseased people inherit two mutant gene copies one from each normal parent the parents have one normal gene copy and one mutant copy explaining why the parents brains do not have this malformation sequencing and analysis of the genomes of two children with microcephaly from the same family identified a single rare gene mutation present in both siblings a deletion of four base pairs within a gene called wdr fig b each parent was found to have one normal copy of wdr and one copy with the four base pair deletion fig b subsequently the researchers found that different families with microcephalic children harbored different mutations in the same gene fig c thus confirming wdr as a causative gene for microcephaly gene therapy may help cure genetic diseases by enabling rapid disease gene discovery the sequencing of whole genomes is revolutionizing medicine knowledge of disease genes can inform parents whether their children might suffer from a severely debilitating disease like microcephaly allowing the parents to consider ways in which to avoid or to prepare for such an outcome moreover identification of a disease gene provides information about the protein encoded by that gene that can sometimes guide the design of effective therapeutics to treat the disease this strategy has not yet been useful in the case of microcephaly but it has already been of tremendous value in developing drugs to combat other genetic diseases including certain kinds of cancer dramatic progress within the last few years offers hope that medical scientists may eventually be able to treat genetic diseases by modifying the genomes of the somatic body cells affected by the disease syndrome one method under development is called gene therapy here scientists introduce normal copies of genes into human cells where they can be expressed and compensate for their mutant nonfunctional counterparts in the genome an alternative very recent gene therapy approach is genome editing in which researchers change the base pair sequence of a mutant gene to that of its normal counterpart gene therapy and genome editing have been used in model organisms such as mice to restore proper gene function and sometimes reverse the disease process but the application of these techniques to human conditions is still only in very early stages figure seven model organisms whose genomes were sequenced as part of the human genome project the chart indicates genome size in millions of base pairs or megabases mb the bottom row shows the approximate number of genes for each organism figure a causal gene for microcephaly identified by genome sequencing a magnetic resonance images of normal and microcephalic brains b sequence analysis of normal and mutant copies of the wdr gene the mutation is a deletion of the four nucleotides tgcc green that causes a major change in the amino acid sequence of the protein product of the gene the letters above each triplet sequence identify the encoded amino acid c five different mutations in the wdr gene in five different families are shown four of the mutations affect the identity of a single amino acid in the protein encoded by the gene for example w s means that the th amino acid is normally w tryptophan but is changed to s serine by the mutation the arrow indicates the position of the tgcc deletion mutation shown in b scientists analyze mutations in model organisms to understand the molecular basis of many biological processes automated sequencing and computer analysis have made possible the rapid determination of dna sequences in genomes allowing researchers to pinpoint genes responsible for genetic diseases knowledge of disease genes helps parents make informed reproductive decisions allows pharmaceutical companies to design effective drugs and in the future will enable medical researchers to manipulate somatic cell genomes to reverse disease effects human genetics and society learning objectives describe the types of information that can be obtained from an individuals genome sequence discuss the social issues that arise from the availability of personal genome sequences over the next years geneticists will identify hundreds of genes with variations that predispose people to many types of disease cardiovascular cancerous immunological mental metabolic some mutations will always cause disease as in the microcephaly example just discussed others will only predispose to disease for example a change in a specific single dna base pair in the globin gene will nearly always cause sickle cell anemia a painful life threatening condition that leads to severe anemia by contrast a mutation in the breast cancer brca gene increases the risk of breast cancer to between and in a woman carrying one copy of the mutation this conditional state arises because the brca gene interacts with environmental factors that affect the probability of activating the cancerous condition and because various forms of other genes can modify the effect of the brca gene mutation physicians may be able to use dna diagnostics a collection of techniques for characterizing genes to analyze an individuals dna for genes that predispose to some diseases with this genetic profile doctors may be able to write out a predictive health history based on probabilities for some medical conditions many social issues need to be addressed although biological information is similar to other types of information from a strictly technical point of view it is as different as can be in its meaning and impact on individual human beings and on human society as a whole the difference lies in the personal nature of the unique genetic profile carried by each person from birth within the genome of each individual is complex information that provides greater or lower susceptibility or resistance to many diseases as well as greater or lesser potential for the expression of many physiological and neurological attributes that distinguish people from each other until now almost all of this information has remained hidden away but if research continues at its present pace in less than a decade it will become possible to understand many aspects of a persons genetic make up and with this information will come the power to make some limited predictions about future possibilities and risks as you will see in many of the genetics and society boxes throughout this book society can use genetic information not only to help people but also to restrict their lives for example by denying insurance or employment we believe that just as our society respects an individuals right to privacy in other realms it should also respect the privacy of an individuals genetic profile and work against all types of discrimination indeed in the united states federal government passed the genetic information nondiscrimination act prohibiting insurance companies and employers from discrimination on the basis of genetic tests another issue raised by the potential for detailed genetic profiles is the interpretation or misinterpretation of that information without accurate interpretation the information becomes useless at best and harmful at worst proper interpretation of genetic information requires some understanding of statistical concepts such as risk and probability as an example women found to have the brca mutation described above need to weigh the possible risks and benefits of preventive treatments such as mastectomy against the statistical probability that they would suffer otherwise from breast cancer to help people understand these concepts widespread education in this area will be essential to many people the most frightening potential of the new genetics is the development of gene therapy technologies that can alter or add to the genes present within the germ line reproductive cell precursors of human embryos in contrast with the previously described use of such genetic engineering to treat diseases in non inheritable somatic cells germ line cells that have been manipulated in these ways can be transmitted between generations and thus have the potential to influence the evolution of our species some people caution that developing the power to alter our own genomes is a step we should not take arguing that if genetic information and technology are misused as they certainly have been in the past the consequences could be horrific attempts to use genetic information for social purposes were prevalent in the early twentieth century leading to enforced sterilization of individuals thought to be inferior to laws that prohibited interracial marriage and to laws prohibiting immigration of certain ethnic groups the basis of these actions was not scientific and has been thoroughly discredited others agree that we must not repeat the mistakes of the past but they warn that if the new technologies could help children and adults lead healthier happier lives we cannot outlaw their application most agree that the biological revolution we are living through will have a greater impact on human society than any technological revolution of the past and that education and public debate are the key to preparing for the consequences of this revolution the focus on human genetics in this book looks forward into the new era of biology and genetic analysis these new possibilities raise serious moral and ethical issues that will demand wisdom and humility it is in the hope of educating young people for the moral and ethical challenges awaiting the next generation that we write this book essential concepts genome sequences may identify not only genes that always cause disease but also genes that predispose an individual to a disease as a society we must ensure that genetic knowledge is properly interpreted and that individuals privacy is protected genetics the study of biological information is also the study of the dna and rna molecules that store replicate transmit express and evolve information for the construction of proteins at the molecular level all living things are closely related and as a result observations of model organisms as different as yeast and mice can provide insights into general biological principles as well as human biology remarkably more than years before the discovery of dna gregor mendel an augustinian monk delineated the basic laws of gene transmission with no knowledge of the molecular basis of heredity he accomplished this by following simple traits such as flower or seed color through several generations of the pea plant pisum sativum we now know that his findings apply to all sexually reproducing organisms chapter describes mendels studies and insights which became the foundation of the field of genetics vocabulary choose

decide a the normal gene function is required for the viability of the zebrafish b the normal gene function is required for the formation of stripes c the normal gene function is required to make the pigment deposited in the stripes d the gene is required in zebrafish only for stripe formation different mutations in the wdr gene that inactivate gene function were found in the genomes of many different people with microcephaly this information provided strong support for the idea that the wdr gene mutation causes microcephaly a the human genome sequence identified wdr as one of the approximately genes in the human genome what information about the function of wdr do you think was learned originally from the dna sequence of the normal human genome b what additional information was provided by identification of wdr as the microcephaly disease gene c the mouse genome contains a gene similar to human wdr experiments in mice have shown that the mouse wdr gene is expressed in the brain technology is now available that allows scientists to generate mice in which the two normal copies of the wdr gene are replaced with mutant copies of the gene that are nonfunctional why would a scientist want to generate such wdr mutant mice researchers have successfully used gene therapy to ameliorate some human genetic diseases by adding a normal gene copy to cells whose genomes originally had only nonfunctional mutant copies of that gene for example a form of blindness due to the lack of a single protein called rpe has been reversed by introduction of a normal rpe gene to cells of the retina of adults a the success of this gene therapy approach provides us with clues about the role of the rpe protein in the retina do you think that rpe is needed for the proper development of the human eye b can you see a potential difficulty in applying this gene therapy approach for diseases like microcephaly section by the time this book is published it will likely be

you are finished reading this book mendels principles of heredity although mendels laws can predict the probability that an individual will have a certain genetic makeup the chance meeting of particular male and female gametes determines an individuals actual genetic fate lawrence manning corbis a quick glance at an extended family portrait is likely to reveal children who resemble one parent or the other or who look like a combination of the two fig some children however look unlike any of the assembled relatives and more like a great great grandparent what causes the similarities and differences of appearance and the skipping of generations the answers lie in our genes the basic units of biological information and in heredity the way genes transmit physiological anatomical and behavioral traits from parents to offspring each of us starts out as a single fertilized egg cell that develops by division and differentiation into a mature adult made up of a hundred trillion specialized cells capable of carrying out all the bodys functions and controlling our outward appearance genes passed from one generation to the next underlie the formation of every heritable trait such traits are as diverse as the presence of a cleft in your chin the tendency to lose hair as you age your hair eye and skin color and even your susceptibility to certain cancers all such traits run in families in predictable patterns that impose some possibilities and exclude others genetics the science of heredity pursues a precise explanation of the biological structures and mechanisms that determine inheritance in some instances the relationship between gene and trait is remarkably simple a single change in a single gene for example results in sickle cell anemia a disease in which the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells is defective in other instances the correlations between genes and traits are bewilderingly complex an example is the genetic basis of facial features in which many genes determine a large number of molecules that interact to generate the combination we recognize as a friends face gregor mendel fig a stocky bespectacled augustinian monk and expert plant breeder discovered the basic principles of genetics in the mid nineteenth century he published his findings in just seven years after darwins on the origin of species appeared in print mendel lived and worked in br nn austria now brno in the czech republic where he examined the inheritance of clear cut alternative traits in pea plants such as purple versus white flowers or yellow versus green seeds in so doing he inferred genetic laws that allowed him to make verifiable predictions about which traits would appear disappear and then reappear and in which generations mendels laws are based on the hypothesis that observable traits are determined by independent units of inheritance not visible to the naked eye we now call these units genes the concept of the gene continues to change as research deepens and refines our understanding today a gene is recognized as a region of dna that encodes a specific protein or a particular type of rna in the beginning however it was an abstraction an imagined particle with no physical features the function of which was to control a visible trait by an unknown mechanism we begin our study of genetics with a detailed look at what mendels laws are and how they were discovered in subsequent chapters we discuss logical extensions to these laws and describe how mendels successors grounded the abstract concept of hereditary units genes in an actual biological molecule dna four general themes emerge from our detailed discussion of mendels work the first is that variation as expressed in alternative forms of a trait is widespread in nature this genetic diversity provides the raw material for the continuously evolving variety of life we see around us second observable variation is essential for following genes from one generation to the next third variation is not distributed solely by chance rather it is inherited according to genetic laws that explain why like begets both like and unlike dogs beget other dogs but hundreds of breeds of dogs are known even within a breed such as labrador retrievers genetic variation exists two black dogs could have a litter of black chocolate brown and yellow puppies fig mendels insights help explain why this is so fourth the laws mendel discovered about heredity apply equally well to all sexually reproducing organisms from protozoans to peas to dogs to people figure

experimental approach is similar to the process of modern scientific inquiry describe how mendel cross fertilized and self fertilized pea plants explain the importance of mendels inclusion of reciprocal crosses within his controlled breeding program of pea plants predict the type of progeny produced by mendels crosses between pure breeding plants with discrete antagonistic traits such as purple versus white flowers several steps lead to an understanding of genetic phenomena the careful observation over time of groups of organisms such as human families herds of cattle or fields of corn or tomatoes the rigorous analysis of systematically recorded information gleaned from these observations and the development of a theoretical framework that can explain the origins and relationships of these phenomena in the mid nineteenth century gregor mendel became the first person to combine data collection analysis and theory in a successful pursuit of the true basis of heredity for many thousands of years before that the only genetic practice was the selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals with no guarantee of what a particular mating would produce artificial selection was the first applied genetic technique a rudimentary use of genetics was the driving force behind a key transition in human civilization allowing hunters and gatherers to settle in villages and survive as shepherds and farmers even before recorded history people practiced applied genetics as they domesticated plants and animals for their own uses from a large litter of semitamed wolves for example they sent the savage and the misbehaving to the stew pot while sparing the alert sentries and friendly companions for longer life and eventual mating as a result of this artificial selection purposeful control over mating by choice of parents for the next generation the domestic dog canis lupus familiaris slowly arose from ancestral wolves canis lupus the oldest bones identified indisputably as dog and not wolf are a skull excavated from a year old alaskan settlement many millennia of evolution guided by artificial selection have produced massive great danes and minuscule chihuahuas as well as hundreds of other modern breeds of dog by years ago people had begun to use this same kind of genetic manipulation to develop economically valuable herds of reindeer sheep goats pigs and cattle that produced lifesustaining meat milk hides and wools farmers also carried out artificial selection of plants storing seed from the hardiest and tastiest individuals for the next planting eventually obtaining strains that grew better produced more and were easier to cultivate and harvest in this way scrawny weed like plants gradually with human guidance turned into rice wheat barley lentils and dates in asia corn squash tomatoes potatoes and peppers in the americas yams peanuts and gourds in africa later plant breeders recognized male and female organs in plants and carried out artificial pollination an assyrian frieze carved in the ninth century b c pictured in fig is the oldest known visual record of this kind of genetic experiment it depicts priests brushing the flowers of female date palms with selected male pollen by this method of artificial selection early practical geneticists produced several hundred varieties of dates each differing in specific observable qualities such as the fruits size color or taste a botanical survey of three oases in egypt turned up varieties of date bearing palms twentieth century evidence of the natural and artificially generated variation among these trees figure the earliest known record of applied genetics in this year old assyrian relief from the northwest palace of assurnasirpal ii b c priests wearing bird masks artificially pollinate flowers of female date palms image copyright the metropolitan museum of art image source art resource ny desirable traits sometimes disappear and reappear in the year of mendels birth what people in austria understood about the basic principles of heredity was not much different from what the people of ancient assyria had known by the nineteenth century plant and animal breeders had created many strains in which offspring often carried a prized parental trait using such strains breeders could produce plants or animals with desired characteristics for food and fiber but they could not always predict why a valued trait would sometimes disappear and then reappear in only some offspring for example selective breeding practices had resulted in valuable flocks of merino sheep producing large quantities of soft fine wool but at the annual meeting of the moravian sheep breeders society one breeders dilemma epitomized the state of the art he possessed an outstanding ram that would be priceless if its advantages are inherited by its offspring but if they are not inherited then it is worth no more than the cost of wool meat and skin which would it be according to the meetings recorded minutes current breeding practices offered no definite answers in his concluding remarks at this sheep breeders meeting the abbot cyril napp pointed to a possible way out he proposed that breeders could improve their ability to predict what traits would appear in the offspring by finding the answers to three basic questions what is inherited how is it inherited what is the role of chance in heredity this quandary is where matters stood in when year old gregor mendel entered the monastery in br nn presided over by the same abbot napp although mendel was a monk trained in theology he was not a rank amateur in science the province of moravia in which br nn was located was a center of learning and scientific activity mendel was able to acquire a copy of darwins on the origin of species shortly after it was translated into german in abbot napp recognizing mendels intellectual abilities sent him to the university of vienna all expenses paid where he prescribed his own course of study mendels choices were an unusual mix physics mathematics chemistry botany paleontology and plant physiology christian doppler discoverer of the doppler effect was one of his teachers the cross pollination of ideas from several disciplines would play a significant role in mendels discoveries one year after he returned to br nn he began his series of seminal genetic experiments figure shows where mendel worked and the microscope he used mendel devised a new experimental approach before mendel many misconceptions clouded peoples thinking about heredity two of the prevailing errors were particularly misleading the first was that one parent contributes most to an offsprings inherited features nicolaas hartsoeker one of the earliest microscopists contended in that it was the male by way of a fully formed homunculus inside the sperm fig another deceptive notion was the concept of blended inheritance the idea that parental traits become mixed and forever changed in the offspring as when blue and yellow pigments merge to green on a painters palette the theory of blending may have grown out of a natural tendency for parents to see a combination of their own traits in their offspring while blending could account for children who look like a combination of their parents it could not explain obvious differences between biological brothers and sisters nor the persistence of variation within extended families the experiments mendel devised would lay these myths to rest by providing precise verifiable answers to the three questions abbot napp had raised almost years earlier what is inherited how is it inherited what is the role of chance in heredity a key component of mendels breakthrough was the way he set up his experiments what did mendel do differently from those who preceded him first he chose the garden pea pisum sativum as his experimental organism figs a and b peas grew well in br nn and with male and female organs in the same flower they were normally self fertilizing in self fertilization or selfing both egg and pollen come from the same plant the particular anatomy of pea flowers however makes it easy to prevent self fertilization and instead to cross fertilize or cross two individuals by brushing pollen from one plant onto a female organ of another plant as illustrated in fig c peas offered yet another advantage for each successive generation mendel could obtain large numbers of individuals within a relatively short growing season by comparison if he had worked with sheep each mating would have generated only a few offspring and the time between generations would have been several years second mendel examined the inheritance of clear cut alternative forms of particular traits purple versus white flowers yellow versus green peas using such either or traits he could distinguish and trace unambiguously the transmission of one or the other observed characteristic because no intermediate forms existed the opposite of these so called discrete traits are continuous traits such as height and skin color in humans continuous traits show many intermediate forms third mendel collected and perpetuated lines of peas that bred true matings within such pure breeding or true breeding lines produce offspring carrying specific parental traits that remain constant from generation to generation these lines are also called inbred because they have been mated only to each other for many generations mendel observed his pure breeding lines for up to eight generations plants with white flowers always produced offspring with white flowers plants with purple flowers produced only offspring with purple flowers mendel called constant but mutually exclusive alternative traits such as purple versus white flowers or yellow versus green seeds antagonistic pairs and he settled on seven such pairs for his study fig in his experiments mendel not only perpetuated pure breeding stocks for each member of a pair but he also cross fertilized pairs of plants to produce hybrids offspring of genetically dissimilar parents for each pair of antagonistic traits figure shows the appearance of the hybrids he studied fourth being an expert plant breeder mendel carefully controlled his matings going to great lengths to ensure that the progeny he observed really resulted from the specific fertilizations he intended thus mendel painstakingly prevented the intrusion of any foreign pollen and assured self or cross pollination as the experiment demanded not only did this allow him to carry out controlled breedings of selected traits but he could also make reciprocal crosses in such crosses he reversed the traits of the male and female parents thus controlling whether a particular trait was transmitted via the egg cell within the ovule or via a sperm cell within the pollen for example he could use pollen from a purple flower to fertilize the eggs of a white flower and also use pollen from a white flower to fertilize the eggs of a purple flower because the progeny of these reciprocal crosses were similar mendel demonstrated that the two parents contribute equally to inheritance it is immaterial to the form of the hybrid he wrote which of the parental types was the seed or pollen plant fifth mendel worked with large numbers of plants counted all offspring subjected his findings to numerical analysis and then compared his results with predictions based on his models he was the first person to study inheritance in this manner and no doubt his background in physics and mathematics contributed to this quantitative approach mendels careful numerical analysis revealed patterns of transmission that reflected basic laws of heredity finally mendel was a brilliant practical experimentalist when comparing tall and short plants for example he made sure that the short ones were out of the shade of the tall ones so their growth would not be stunted eventually he focused on certain traits of the pea seeds themselves such as their color or shape rather than on traits of the plants arising from the seeds in this way he could observe many more individuals from the limited space of the monastery garden and he could evaluate the results of a cross in a single growing season in short mendel purposely set up a simplified blackand white experimental system and then figured out how it worked he did not look at the vast number of variables that determine the development of a prize ram nor at the origin of differences between species rather he looked at discrete traits that came in two mutually exclusive forms and asked questions that could be answered by observation and computation people practiced artificial selection of crop plants and domestic animals for thousands of years without understanding how heredity works mendel established pure breeding lines of peas in which a specific characteristic would remain constant from one generation to the next when mendel crossed pure breeding lines with alternative traits the hybrid progeny always had the characteristics of one parent in mendels experiments the hybrid progeny produced by reciprocal cross fertilizations had the same characteristics it did not matter which parent was male and which was female figure mendels garden and microscope a gregor mendels garden was part of his monasterys property in br nn b mendel

predict the genotypic and phenotypic ratios among progeny of complex multihybrid crosses using simple rules of probability cite the most common molecular explanations for dominant and recessive alleles in early at the age of gregor mendel presented a paper entitled experiments on plant hybrids before the natural science society of br nn despite its modest heading this was a scientific paper of uncommon clarity and simplicity that summarized a decade of original observations and experiments in it mendel describes in detail the transmission of visible characteristics in pea plants defines unseen but logically deduced units genes that determine when and how often these visible traits appear and analyzes the behavior of genes in simple mathematical terms to reveal previously unsuspected principles of heredity published the following year the paper would eventually become the cornerstone of modern genetics its stated purpose was to see whether there is a generally applicable law governing the formation and development of hybrids let us examine its insights monohybrid crosses reveal the law of segregation once mendel had isolated pure breeding lines for several sets of characteristics he carried out a series of matings between individuals that differed in only one trait such as seed color or stem length in each cross one parent carries one form of the trait and the other parent carries an alternative form of the same trait figure illustrates one such mating early in the spring of for example mendel planted pure breeding green peas and pure breeding yellow peas and allowed them to grow into the parental p generation later that spring when the plants had flowered he dusted the female stigma of green pea plant flowers with pollen from yellow pea plants he also performed the reciprocal cross dusting yellow pea plant stigmas with greenpea pollen in the fall when he collected and separately analyzed the progeny peas of these reciprocal crosses he found that in both cases the peas were all yellow these yellow peas progeny of the p generation were the beginning of what we now call the first filial f generation to learn whether the green trait had disappeared entirely or remained intact but hidden in these f yellow peas mendel planted them to obtain mature f plants that he allowed to self fertilize such experiments involving hybrids for a single trait are often called monohybrid crosses he then harvested and counted the peas of the resulting second filial f generation progeny of the f generation among the progeny of one series of f self fertilizations there were yellow and green f peas an almost perfect ratio of yellow green f plants derived from the reciprocal of the original cross produced a similar ratio of yellow to green f progeny reappearance of the recessive trait the presence of green peas in the f generation was irrefutable evidence that blending had not occurred if it had the information necessary to make green peas would have been lost irretrievably in the f hybrids instead the information remained intact and was able to direct the formation of green peas actually harvested from the second filial generation these green peas were indistinguishable from their green grandparents mendel concluded that two types of yellow peas must exist those that breed true like the yellow peas of the p generation and those that can yield some green offspring like the yellow f hybrids this second type somehow contains latent information for green peas he called the trait that appeared in all the f hybrids in this case yellow seeds dominant see fig and the antagonistic green pea trait that remained hidden in the f hybrids but reappeared in the f generation recessive but how did he explain the ratio of yellow to green f peas genes discrete units of inheritance to account for his observations mendel proposed that for each trait every plant carries two copies of a unit of inheritance receiving one from its maternal parent and the other from the paternal parent today we call these units of inheritance genes each unit determines the appearance of a specific characteristic the pea plants in mendels collection had two copies of a gene for seed color two copies of another for seed shape two copies of a third for stem length and so forth mendel further proposed that each gene comes in alternative forms and combinations of these alternative forms determine the contrasting characteristics he was studying today we call the alternative forms of a single gene alleles the gene for pea color for example has yellow and green alleles the gene for pea shape has round and wrinkled alleles in mendels monohybrid crosses one allele of each gene was dominant the other recessive in the p generation one parent carried two dominant alleles for the trait under consideration the other parent two recessive alleles the f generation hybrids carried one dominant and one recessive allele for the trait individuals having two different alleles for a single trait are monohybrids the law of segregation if a plant has two copies of every gene how does it pass only one copy of each to its progeny and how do the offspring then end up with two copies of these same genes one from each parent mendel drew on his background in plant physiology and answered these questions in terms of the two biological mechanisms behind reproduction gamete formation and the random union of gametes at fertilization gametes are the specialized cells eggs within the ovules of the female parent and sperm cells within the pollen grains that carry genes between generations mendel imagined that during the formation of eggs and sperm the two copies of each gene in the parent separate or segregate so that each gamete receives only one allele for each trait fig a thus each egg and each sperm receives only one allele for pea color either yellow or green at fertilization a sperm with one or the other allele unites at random with an egg carrying one or the other allele restoring the two copies of the gene for each trait in the fertilized egg or zygote fig b if the sperm carries yellow and the egg green the result will be a hybrid yellow pea like the f monohybrids that resulted when pure breeding parents of opposite types mated if the yellow carrying sperm unites with a yellow carrying egg the result will be a yellow pea that grows into a pure breeding plant like those of the p generation that produced only yellow peas and finally if sperm carrying the allele for green peas fertilizes a green carrying egg the progeny will be a pure breeding green pea mendels law of segregation encapsulates this general principle of heredity the two alleles for each trait separate segregate during gamete formation and then unite at random one from each parent at fertilization throughout this book the term segregation refers to such equal segregation in which one allele and only one allele of each gene goes to each gamete note that the law of segregation makes a clear distinction between the somatic cells body cells of an organism which have two copies of each gene and the gametes which bear only a single copy of each gene the punnett square figure shows a simple way of visualizing the results of the segregation and random union of alleles during gamete formation and fertilization mendel invented a system of symbols that allowed him to analyze all his crosses in the same way he designated dominant alleles with a capital a b or c and recessive ones with a lowercase a b or c modern geneticists have adopted this convention for naming genes in peas and many other organisms but they often choose a symbol with some reference to the trait in question a y for yellow or an r for round throughout this book we present gene symbols in italics in fig we denote the dominant yellow allele with a capital y and the recessive green allele with a lowercase y the pure breeding plants of the parental generation are either yy yellow peas or yy green peas the yy parent can produce only y gametes the yy parent only y gametes you can see in fig why every cross between yy and yy produces exactly the same result a yy hybrid no matter which parent male or female contributes which particular allele next to visualize what happens when the yy hybrids self fertilize we set up a punnett square named after the british mathematician reginald punnett who introduced it in fig the square provides a simple and convenient method for tracking the kinds of gametes produced as well as all the possible combinations that might occur at fertilization as the punnett square shows in the first column and the first row each hybrid produces two kinds of gametes y and y in a ratio of thus half the sperm and half the eggs carry y the other half of each gamete type carries y each box in the punnett square in fig containing a colored pea represents one possible fertilization event at fertilization of the progeny will be yy yy yy and yy because the gametic source of an allele egg or sperm for the traits mendel studied had no influence on the alleles effect yy and yy are equivalent this means that of the progeny are yellow yy hybrids yy true breeding yellows and true breeding yy greens the diagram illustrates how the segregation of alleles during gamete formation and the random union of egg and sperm at fertilization can produce the ratio of yellow to green that mendel observed in the f generation mendels results reflect basic rules of probability though you may not have realized it the punnett square illustrates two simple rules of probability the product rule and the sum rule that are central to the analysis of genetic crosses these rules predict the likelihood that a particular combination of events will occur the product rule the product rule states that the probability of two or more independent events occurring together is the product of the probabilities that each event will occur by itself with independent events probability of event and event probability of event probability of event consecutive coin tosses are obviously independent events a heads in one toss neither increases nor decreases the probability of a heads in the next toss if you toss two coins at the same time the results are also independent events a heads for one coin neither increases nor decreases the probability of a heads for the other coin thus the probability of a given combination is the product of their independent probabilities for example the probability that both coins will turn up heads is similarly the formation of egg and sperm are independent events in a hybrid plant the probability is that a given gamete will carry y and that it will carry y because fertilization happens at random the probability that a particular combination of maternal and paternal alleles will occur simultaneously in the same zygote is the product of the independent probabilities of these alleles being packaged in egg and sperm thus to find the chance of a y egg formed as the result of one event uniting with a y sperm the result of an independent event you simply multiply to get this is the same fraction of yy progeny seen in the punnett square of fig which demonstrates that the punnett square is simply another way of depicting the product rule it is important to realize that each box in the punnett square represents an equally likely outcome of the cross an equally likely fertilization event only because each of the two types of sperm and eggs y and y are produced at equal frequencies the sum rule while we can describe the moment of random fertilization as the simultaneous occurrence of two independent events we can also say that two different fertilization events are mutually exclusive for instance if y combines with y it cannot also combine with y in the same zygote a second rule of probability the sum rule states that the probability of either of two such mutually exclusive events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities with mutually exclusive events probability of event or event probability of event probability of event to find the likelihood that an offspring of a yy hybrid self fertilization will be a hybrid like the parents you add the probability of maternal y uniting with paternal y and the probability of the mutually exclusive event where paternal y unites with maternal y to get again the same result as in the punnett square in another use of the sum rule you could predict the ratio of yellow to green f progeny the fraction of f peas that will be yellow is the sum of the event producing yy plus the mutually exclusive event generating yy plus the mutually exclusive event producing yy to get the remaining of the f progeny will be green so the yellow to green ratio is to or more simply analyzing a monohybrid cross cross pollination of pure breeding parental plants produces f hybrids all of which resemble one of the parents self pollination of f plants gives rise to an f generation with a ratio of individuals resembling the two original parental types for simplicity we do not show the plants that produce the peas or that grow from the planted peas generation yellow peas green peas all yellow self fertilization yellow green the law of segregation a the two identical alleles of pure breeding plants separate segregate during gamete formation as a result each sperm or egg carries only one of each pair of parental alleles b cross pollination and fertilization between pure breeding parents with antagonistic traits result in f hybrid zygotes with two different alleles for the seed color gene a yy hybrid zygote will develop into a yellow pea the two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation yy yellow pea from a pure breeding stock grows into plant gamete formation grows into plant gamete formation gametes sperm or eggs yy green pea from a pure breeding stock two gametes

formation and self fertilization the f generation should have a ratio of yellow to green peas gametes f all identical y yy f yy yy y y yy y eggs sperm each box figure yellow f peas are of two types pure breeding and hybrid the distribution of a pair of contrasting alleles y and y after two generations of self fertilization the homozygous individuals of each generation breed true whereas the hybrids do not selffertilization selffertilization further crosses verify the law of segregation the law of segregation was a hypothesis that explained the data from simple crosses involving monohybrid peas but mendel needed to perform additional experiments to check its validity mendels hypothesis summarized in fig made the testable prediction that the f should have two kinds of yellow peas yy and yy but only one kind of green pea yy in addition his hypothesis predicted that the yy and yy yellow peas in the f should be present in a ratio of yy yy to verify these expectations mendel allowed selffertilization of all the plants in the f generation and counted the types of f progeny fig he found that the plants that developed from f green peas all produced only green peas in the f and when the resulting f plants self fertilized the next generation the f also produced green peas not shown this is what we and mendel would expect of pure breeding yy lines carrying two copies of the recessive allele the yellow peas were a different story when mendel allowed f plants that developed from yellow peas to self fertilize he observed that roughly of the total were pure breeding yellow through several generations but the other of the total yellow f plants were hybrids because they gave rise to yellow and green f peas in a ratio of therefore as mendels theory anticipated the ratio of yy to yy among the f yellow pea plants was indeed it took mendel years to conduct such rigorous experiments on seven pairs of pea traits but in the end he was able to conclude that the segregation of dominant and recessive alleles during gamete formation and their random union at fertilization could indeed explain the ratios he observed whenever he allowed hybrids to self fertilize his results however raised yet another question one of some importance to future plant and animal breeders plants showing a dominant trait such as yellow peas can be either pure breeding yy or hybrid yy how can you distinguish one from the other for self fertilizing plants the answer is to observe the appearance of the next generation but how would you distinguish pure breeding from hybrid individuals in species that do not self fertilize figure genotype versus phenotype in homozygotes and heterozygotes the relationship between genotype and phenotype with a pair of contrasting alleles

recessive allele cross a cross b o spring all yellow o spring yellow to green figure how a testcross reveals genotype an individual of unknown genotype but dominant phenotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive if the unknown genotype is homozygous all progeny will exhibit the dominant phenotype cross a if the unknown genotype is heterozygous half the progeny will exhibit the dominant trait half the recessive trait cross b testcrosses a way to establish genotype before describing mendels answer we need to define a few more terms an observable characteristic such as yellow or green pea seeds is a phenotype while the actual pair of alleles present in an individual is its genotype a yy or a yy genotype is called homozygous because the two copies of the gene that determine the particular trait in question are the same in contrast a genotype with two different alleles for a trait is heterozygous in other words it is a hybrid for that trait fig an individual with a homozygous genotype is a homozygote one with a heterozygous genotype is a heterozygote note that the phenotype of a heterozygote that is of a hybrid defines which allele is dominant because yy peas are yellow the yellow allele y is dominant to the y allele for green if you know the genotype and the dominance relation of the alleles you can accurately predict the phenotype the reverse is not true however because some phenotypes can derive from more than one genotype for example the phenotype of yellow peas can result from either the yy or the yy genotype with these distinctions in mind we can look at the method mendel devised for deciphering the unknown genotype well call it y responsible for a dominant phenotype the dash represents the unknown second allele either y or y this method called the testcross is a mating in which an individual showing the dominant phenotype for instance a y plant grown from a yellow pea is crossed with an individual expressing the recessive phenotype in this case a yy plant grown from a green pea as the punnett squares in fig illustrate if the dominant phenotype in question derives from a homozygous yy genotype all the offspring of the testcross will show the dominant yellow phenotype but if the dominant parent of unknown genotype is a heterozygous hybrid yy half of the progeny are expected to be yellow peas and the other half green in this way the testcross establishes the genotype behind a dominant phenotype resolving any uncertainty as we mentioned earlier mendel deliberately simplified the problem of heredity focusing on traits that come in only two forms he was able to replicate his basic monohybrid findings with corn beans and four oclocks plants with tubular white or bright red flowers as it turns out his concept of the gene and his law of segregation can be generalized to almost all sexually reproducing organisms dihybrid crosses reveal the law of independent assortment having determined from monohybrid crosses that genes are inherited according to the law of segregation mendel turned his attention to the simultaneous inheritance of two or more apparently unrelated traits in peas he asked how two pairs of alleles would segregate in a dihybrid individual that is in a plant that is heterozygous for two genes at the same time to construct such a dihybrid mendel mated truebreeding plants grown from yellow round peas yy rr with true breeding plants grown from green wrinkled peas yy rr from this cross he obtained a dihybrid f generation yy rr showing the two dominant phenotypes yellow and round fig he then allowed these f dihybrids to self fertilize to produce the f generation mendel could not predict the outcome of this mating would all the f progeny be parental types that looked like either the original yellow round parent or the green wrinkled parent or would some new combinations of phenotypes occur that were not seen in the parental lines such as yellow wrinkled or green round peas new phenotypic combinations like these are called recombinant types figure a dihybrid cross produces parental types and recombinant types in this dihybrid cross pure breeding parents p produce a genetically uniform generation of f dihybrids self pollination or cross pollination of the f plants yields the characteristic f phenotypic ratio of parental recombinant recombinant parental y r yy r y rr yy rr yellow round green round yellow wrinkled green wrinkled number phenotypic ratio of yellow dominant to green recessive or ratio of round dominant to wrinkled recessive or when mendel counted the f generation of one experiment he found yellow round peas green round yellow wrinkled and green wrinkled both yellow wrinkled and green round recombinant phenotypes did in fact appear providing evidence that some shuffling of the alleles of different genes had taken place the law of independent assortment from the observed ratios mendel inferred the biological mechanism of that shuffling the independent assortment of gene pairs during gamete formation because the genes for pea color and for pea shape assort independently the allele for pea shape in a gamete carrying y could with equal likelihood be either r or r thus the presence of a particular allele of one gene say the dominant y for pea color provides no information whatsoever about the allele of the second gene each dihybrid of the f generation can therefore make four kinds of gametes y r y r y r and y r in a large number of gametes the four kinds will appear in an almost perfect ratio of or put another way roughly of the eggs and of the sperm will contain each of the four possible combinations of alleles that the different kinds of germinal cells eggs or sperm of a hybrid are produced on the average in equal numbers was yet another one of mendels incisive insights at fertilization then in a mating of dihybrids different kinds of eggs can each combine with any of different kinds of sperm producing a total of possible zygotes once again a punnett square is a convenient way to visualize the process fig using the same kind of logic previously applied to the punnett square for monohybrid crosses review fig each of the boxes with colored peas in the punnett square for the dihybrid cross in fig represents an equally likely fertilization event again each box is an equally likely outcome only because each of the different gamete types is produced at equal frequency in each parent therefore using the product rule the frequency of the progeny type in each box is if you look at the square in fig you will see that some of the potential allelic combinations are identical in fact only nine different genotypes exist yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr yy rr and yy rr because the source of the alleles egg or sperm does not make any difference if you look at the combinations of traits determined by the nine genotypes you will see only four phenotypes yellow round green round yellow wrinkled and green wrinkled in a ratio of if however you look only at pea color or only at pea shape you can see that each trait is inherited in the ratio predicted by mendels law of segregation in the punnett square there are yellow for every green and round for every wrinkled in other words the ratio of each dominant trait yellow or round to its antagonistic recessive trait green or wrinkled is or this means that the inheritance of the gene for pea color is unaffected by the inheritance of the gene for pea shape and vice versa the preceding analysis became the basis of mendels second general genetic principle the law of independent assortment during gamete formation different pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other fig the independence of their segregation and the subsequent random union of gametes at fertilization determine the phenotypes observed using the product rule for assessing the probability of independent events you can see mathematically how the phenotypic ratio observed in a dihybrid cross derives from two separate phenotypic ratios if the two sets of alleles assort independently the yellow to green ratio in the f generation will be and likewise the round towrinkled ratio will be to find the probability that two independent events such as yellow and round will occur simultaneously in the same plant you multiply as follows probability of yellow round probability of green round probability of yellow wrinkled probability of green wrinkled thus in a population of f plants there will be a phenotypic ratio of yellow round to green round to yellow wrinkled to green wrinkled branched line diagrams a convenient way to keep track of the probabilities of each potential outcome in a genetic cross is to construct a branched line diagram fig which shows all the possible genotypes or phenotypes for each gene in a sequence of columns in fig the first column shows the two possible pea color phenotypes the second column demonstrates that each pea color can occur with either of two pea shapes again the ratio of phenotypes is apparent you will see later that branched line diagrams are more convenient than punnett squares for predicting the outcomes of crosses involving more than two genes alleles in parental cell gamete formation possible allele combinations in gametes figure the law of independent assortment in a dihybrid cross each pair of alleles assorts independently during gamete formation in the gametes y is equally likely to be found with r or r that is y r y r the same is true for y that is y r y r as a result all four possible types of gametes y r y r y r and y r are produced in equal frequency among a large population gene yellow green round round wrinkled gene phenotypes wrinkled yellow round green round yellow wrinkled green wrinkled figure following crosses with branched line diagrams a branched line diagram which uses a series of columns to track every gene in a cross provides an organized overview of all possible outcomes this branched line diagram of a dihybrid cross generates the same phenotypic ratios as the punnett square in fig showing that the two methods are equivalent figure testcrosses with dihybrids testcrosses involving two pairs of independently assorting alleles yield different predictable results depending on the tested individuals genotype for the two genes in question testcrosses with dihybrids an understanding of dihybrid crosses has many applications suppose for example that you work for a nursery that has three pure breeding strains yellow wrinkled green round and green wrinkled your assignment is to grow pure breeding plants guaranteed to produce yellow round peas how would you proceed one answer is to cross your two pure breeding strains yy rr yy rr to generate a dihybrid yy rr then selfcross the dihybrid and plant only the yellow round peas only one out of nine of such progeny those grown from peas with a yy rr genotype will be appropriate for your uses to find these plants you could subject each yellow round candidate to a testcross for genotype with a green wrinkled yy rr plant as illustrated in fig if the testcross yields all yellow round offspring testcross a you can sell your test plant because you know it is homozygous for both pea color and pea shape if your testcross yields yellow round and yellow wrinkled testcross b or yellow round and green round testcross c you know that the candidate plant in question is genetically homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for the other and must therefore be discarded finally if the testcross yields yellow round yellow wrinkled green round and green wrinkled testcross d you know that the plant is a heterozygote for both the pea color and the pea shape genes geneticists use mendels laws to calculate probabilities and make predictions mendel performed several sets of dihybrid crosses and also carried out multihybrid crosses matings between the f progeny of pure breeding parents that differed in three or more unrelated traits in all of these experiments he observed numbers and ratios very close to what he expected on the basis of his two general biological principles the alleles of a gene segregate during the formation of egg or sperm and the alleles of different genes assort independently of each other mendels laws of inheritance in conjunction with the mathematical rules of probability provide geneticists with powerful tools for predicting and interpreting the results of genetic crosses but as with all tools they have their limitations we examine here both the power and the limitations of mendelian analysis first the power using simple mendelian analysis it is possible to make accurate predictions about the offspring of extremely complex crosses suppose you want to predict the occurrence of one specific genotype in a cross involving several independently assorting genes for example if hybrids that are heterozygous for four traits are allowed to self fertilize aa bb cc dd aa bb cc dd what proportion of their progeny will have the genotype aa bb cc dd you could set up a punnett square to answer the question because for each trait there are two different alleles the number of different eggs or sperm is found by raising to the power of the number of differing traits n where n is the number of traits by this calculation each hybrid parent in this cross with traits would make different kinds of gametes the punnett square depicting such a cross would thus contain boxes setting up such a square may be fine if you live in a monastery with a bit of time on your hands but not if youre taking a hour exam it would be much simpler to analyze the problem by breaking down the multihybrid cross into four independently assorting monohybrid crosses remember that the genotypic ratios of each monohybrid cross are homozygote for the dominant allele to heterozygotes to homozygote for the recessive allele thus you can find the probability of aa bb cc dd by multiplying the probability of each independent event aa of the progeny produced by aa aa bb cc dd the punnett square approach would provide the same answer but it would require much more time if instead of a specific genotype you want to predict the probability of a certain phenotype you can again use the product rule as long as you know the phenotypic ratios produced by each pair of alleles in the cross for example if in the multihybrid cross of aa bb cc dd aa bb cc dd you want to know how many offspring will show the dominant a trait genotype aa or aa or the recessive b trait genotype bb the dominant c trait genotype cc or cc and the dominant d trait genotype dd or dd you simply multiply in this way the rules of probability make it possible to predict the outcome of very complex crosses you can see from these examples that particular problems in genetics are amenable to particular modes of analysis as a rule of thumb punnett squares are excellent for visualizing simple crosses involving a few genes but they become unwieldy in the dissection of more complicated matings direct calculations of probabilities such as those in the two preceding problems are useful when you want to know the chances of one or a few outcomes of complex crosses if however you want to know all the outcomes of a multihybrid cross a branched line diagram is the best way to go as it will keep track of all the possibilities in an organized fashion now the limitations of mendelian analysis like mendel if you were to breed pea plants or corn or any other organism you would most likely observe some deviation from the ratios you expected in each generation what can account for such variation one element is chance as witnessed in the common coin toss experiment with each throw the probability of the coin coming up heads is equal to the likelihood it will come up tails but if you toss a coin times you may get heads and tails or vice versa if you toss it times you are more likely to get a result closer to the expected heads and tails the larger the number of trials the lower the probability that chance significantly skews the data the statistical benefit is one reason mendel worked with large numbers of pea plants mendels laws in fact have great predictive power for populations of organisms but they do not tell us what will happen in any one individual with a garden full of selffertilizing monohybrid pea plants for example you can expect that of the f progeny will show the dominant phenotype and the recessive but you cannot predict the phenotype of any particular f plant in chapter we discuss mathematical methods for assessing whether the chance variation observed in a sample of individuals within a population is compatible with a genetic hypothesis mendels genius was unappreciated before mendels insights into the workings of heredity were a breakthrough of monumental proportions by counting and analyzing data from hundreds of pea plant crosses he inferred the existence of genes independent units that determine the observable patterns of inheritance for particular traits his work explained the reappearance of hidden traits disproved the idea of blended inheritance and showed that mother and father make an equal genetic contribution to the next generation the model of heredity that he formulated was so specific that he could test predictions based on it by observation and experiment with the exception of abbot napp none of mendels contemporaries appreciated the importance of his research mendel did not teach at a prestigious university and was not well known outside br nn even in br nn members of the natural science society were disappointed when he presented experiments on plant hybrids to them they wanted to view and discuss intriguing mutants and lovely flowers so they did not appreciate his numerical analyses mendel it seems was far ahead of his time sadly despite written requests from mendel that others try to replicate his studies no one repeated his experiments several citations of his paper between and referred to his expertise as a plant breeder but made no mention of his laws moreover at the time mendel presented his work no one had yet seen the structures within cells the chromosomes that actually carry the genes that would happen only in the next few decades as described in chapter if scientists had been able to see these structures they might have more readily accepted mendels ideas because the chromosomes are actual physical structures that behave exactly as mendel predicted the science of genetics begins with the rediscovery of mendel working independently near the beginning of the twentieth century correns de vries and von tschermak each came to the same conclusions as those mendel summarized in his laws a c spl science source b interfoto alamy d ullstein bild getty images mendels work might have had an important influence on early debates about evolution if it had been more widely appreciated charles darwin who was unfamiliar with mendels work was plagued in his later years by criticism that his explanations for the persistence of variation in organisms were insufficient darwin considered such variation a cornerstone of his theory of evolution maintaining that natural selection would favor particular variants in a given population in a given environment if the selected combinations of variant traits were passed on to subsequent generations this transmission of variation would propel evolution he could not however say how that transmission might occur had darwin been aware of mendels ideas he might not have been backed into such an uncomfortable corner for years mendels laws lay dormant untested unconfirmed and unapplied then in years after mendels death carl correns hugo de vries and erich von tschermak independently rediscovered and acknowledged his work fig the scientific community had finally caught up with mendel within a decade investigators had coined many of the modern terms we have been using phenotype genotype homozygote heterozygote gene and genetics the label given to the twentieth century science of heredity mendels paper provided the new disciplines foundation his principles and analytic techniques endure today guiding geneticists and evolutionary biologists in their studies of genetic variation the influence of molecules on phenotype determines whether alleles are dominant or recessive we now know that genes specify the proteins and rnas that cells produce and that dictate cellular structure and function recently two genes were identified that are likely to correspond to mendels genes for seed shape and seed color the pea shape gene specifies an enzyme known as sbe for starch branching enzyme sbe catalyzes the conversion of amylose an unbranched linear molecule of starch to amylopectin a starch molecule composed of several branching chains fig a the dominant r allele of the pea shape gene determines a normal functioning sbe enzyme in contrast the recessive allele r specifies no sbe enzyme as a result rr homozygotes contain a high proportion of branched starch molecules which allows the peas to maintain a rounded shape in homozygous recessive rr peas sucrose builds up because less of it is converted into starch the excess sucrose modifies the osmotic pressure causing water to enter the young seeds as the seeds mature they lose the water shrink and wrinkle the single dominant allele in rr heterozygotes apparently specifies enough of the normal sbe enzyme to prevent wrinkling the pea color gene determines an enzyme called sgr for stay green sgr performs one step in the pathway leading to the breakdown of the green pigment chlorophyll a process that occurs naturally in peas as they mature fig b the dominant y allele specifies sgr and the recessive y allele does not homozygous yy or heterozygous yy peas are yellow because they each have enough sgr to break down all the chlorophyll homozygous yy peas stay green because they lack the sgr enzyme and the chlorophyll remains two general principles emerge from these molecular discoveries first a specific gene determines a specific protein in these cases an enzyme the activity of the protein may affect the phenotype of the pea plant in any number of ways depending on the biochemical pathway in which it functions second a pattern can be seen in both of these examples the dominant allele determines a normally functioning protein while the recessive allele does not specify a functional protein you will see in chapter that although it is certainly not always the case the molecular explanation described here is the most common reason why one allele is dominant to another recessive allele genes likely to be those mendel described for stem length and flower color have also been identified recently in both cases the dominant allele encodes a normally functioning protein and the recessive allele specifies either no protein or a less functional version of the normal protein essential concepts discrete units called genes control the appearance of inherited traits genes come in alternative forms called alleles a sexually reproducing organisms body cells contain two alleles for every gene these alleles may be the same in a homozygote or different in a heterozygote genotype refers to the alleles an individual possesses phenotype refers to the traits the individual exhibits the dominant allele controls the phenotype of a trait in heterozygotes the other allele in the heterozygote is recessive in monohybrid crosses the dominant and recessive phenotypes will appear in the progeny in a ratio of alleles segregate during the formation of gametes which thus contain only one allele of each gene male and female gametes unite at random at fertilization these two processes correspond to mendels law of segregation the segregation of alleles of any one gene is independent of the segregation of the alleles of other genes this principle is mendels law of independent assortment according to this law crosses between aa bb dihybrids will generate progeny with a phenotypic ratio of a b a bb aa b aa bb most often the dominant allele of a gene specifies a functional product a protein while the recessive allele determines either a less functional or nonfunctional version of the protein or no protein at all figure molecular explanations of mendels pea shape and pea color genes the r allele of the pea shape gene specifies the enzyme sbe which converts unbranched starch amylose to branched starch amylopectin the r allele does not produce sbe the buildup of unbranched starch in rr peas ultimately causes seed wrinkling the y allele of the pea color gene specifies the enzyme sgr which functions in a pathway to break down chlorophyll during pea maturation resulting in yellow peas the y allele does not produce sgr chlorophyll is not broken down in yy peas and they remain green biochemical

exhibits recessive or dominant inheritance explain why huntington disease is inherited as a dominant allele while cystic fibrosis is caused by a recessive allele although many human traits clearly run in families most do not show a simple mendelian pattern of inheritance suppose for example that you have brown eyes but both your parents eyes appear to be blue because blue is normally considered recessive to brown does this mean that you are adopted or that your father isnt really your father not necessarily because eye color is influenced by more than one gene like eye color most common and obvious human phenotypes arise from the interaction of many genes in contrast single gene traits in people usually involve an abnormality that is disabling or life threatening examples are the progressive neurological damage of huntington disease and the clogged lungs and potential respiratory failure of cystic fibrosis a defective allele of a single gene gives rise to huntington disease defective alleles of a different gene are responsible for cystic fibrosis table lists some of the roughly such single gene or mendelian traits known in humans as of as you will see the allele that causes huntington disease is dominant and the normal nondisease allele of this gene is recessive the opposite is true for cystic fibrosis the disease causing allele is recessive and the normal nondisease allele is dominant pedigrees aid the study of hereditary traits in human families determining a genetic defects pattern of transmission is not always an easy task because people make slippery genetic subjects their generation time is long and the families they produce are relatively small which makes statistical analysis difficult humans do not base their choice of mates on purely genetic considerations thus no pure breeding lines exist and no controlled matings are possible furthermore people rarely produce a true f generation like the one in which mendel observed the ratios from which he derived his rules because brothers and sisters almost never mate geneticists circumvent these difficulties by working with a large number of families or with several generations of a very large family in this way scientists can study the large numbers of genetically related individuals needed to establish the inheritance patterns of specific traits a family history known as a pedigree is an orderly diagram of a familys relevant genetic features extending back to at least both sets of grandparents and preferably through as many additional generations as possible from systematic pedigree analysis in the light of mendels laws geneticists can tell if a trait is determined by alternative alleles of a single gene and whether a single gene trait is dominant or recessive because mendels principles are so simple and straightforward a little logic can go a long way in explaining how traits are inherited in humans figure shows how to interpret a family pedigree diagram squares represent males circles are females diamonds indicate that the sex is unspecified family members affected by the trait in question are indicated by a filled in symbol for example a single horizontal line connecting a male and a female represents a mating a double connecting line designates a consanguineous mating that is a mating between relatives and a horizontal line above a series of symbols indicates the children of the same parents a sibship arranged and numbered from left to right in order of their birth roman numerals to the left or right of the diagram indicate the generations to reach a conclusion about the mode of inheritance of a family trait human geneticists must use a pedigree that supplies sufficient information for example researchers could not determine whether the allele causing the disease depicted at the bottom of fig is dominant or recessive solely on the basis of the simple pedigree shown the data are consistent with both possibilities if the trait is dominant then the father and the affected son are heterozygotes while the mother and the unaffected son are homozygotes for the recessive normal allele if instead the trait is recessive the father and affected son are homozygotes for the recessive disease causing allele while the mother and the unaffected son are heterozygotes several kinds of additional information could help resolve this uncertainty human geneticists would particularly want to know the frequency at which the trait in question is found in the population from which the family came if the trait is rare in the population then the allele giving rise to the trait should also be rare and the most likely hypothesis would require that the fewest genetically unrelated people carry the allele only the father in fig would need to have a dominant disease causing allele but both parents would need to carry a recessive disease causing allele the father two copies and the mother one however even the information that the trait is rare does not allow us to draw the firm conclusion that it is inherited in a dominant fashion the pedigree in the figure is so limited that we cannot be sure the two parents are themselves unrelated as we discuss later in more detail related parents might have both received the same rare recessive allele from their common ancestor this example illustrates why human geneticists try to collect family histories that cover several generations we now look at more extensive pedigrees for the dominant trait of huntington disease and for the recessive condition of cystic fibrosis the patterns by which these traits appear in the pedigrees provide important clues that can indicate modes of inheritance and allow geneticists to assign genotypes to family members

ected generation generation a vertical pattern of inheritance indicates a rare dominant trait huntington disease is named for george huntington the new york physician who first described its course this illness usually shows up in middle age and slowly destroys its victims both mentally and physically symptoms include intellectual deterioration severe depression and jerky irregular movements all caused by the progressive death of nerve cells if one parent develops the symptoms his or her children usually have a probability of suffering from the disease provided they live to adulthood because symptoms are not present at birth and manifest themselves only later in life huntington disease is known as a late onset genetic trait how would you proceed in assigning genotypes to the individuals in the huntington disease pedigree depicted in fig first you would need to find out if the diseaseproducing allele is dominant or recessive several clues suggest that huntington disease is transmitted by a dominant allele of a single gene everyone who develops the disease has at least one parent who shows the trait and in several generations approximately half of the offspring are affected the pattern of affected individuals is thus vertical if you trace back through the ancestors of any affected individual you would see at least one affected person in each generation giving a continuous line of family members with the disease when a disease is rare in the population as a whole a vertical pattern is strong evidence that a dominant allele causes the trait the alternative would require that many unrelated people carry a rare recessive allele a recessive trait that is extremely common might also show up in every generation we examine this possibility in problem at the end of this chapter figure huntington disease a rare dominant trait all individuals represented by filled in symbols are heterozygotes except i who could instead have been homozygous for the dominant hd disease allele all individuals represented by open symbols are homozygotes for the recessive hd normal allele among the children of the consanguineous mating dna testing shows that some are hd hd some are hd hd and some are hd hd the diamond designation masks personal details to protect confidentiality in tracking a dominant allele through a pedigree you can view every mating between an affected and an unaffected partner as analogous to a testcross if some of the offspring do not have huntington disease you know the parent showing the trait is a heterozygote as an exercise you should check your own genotype assignments against the answers in the caption to fig notice also in the legend to fig that human geneticists use different symbols than mendels for alleles of genes in human genotypes all alleles are written in uppercase if the allele specifies a normally functioning gene product the allele symbol has a superscript alleles that specify no gene product or abnormal gene products sometimes have no superscript at all as in the fig legend but in other cases they have a superscript other than that signifies a particular type of abnormal allele see the appendix guidelines for gene nomenclature for further discussion of genetic notation like mendels pea genes the gene that causes huntington disease has been identified and studied at the molecular level in fact in this was the first human disease gene identified molecularly using methods that will be described in chapter the protein product of the huntington disease gene called huntingtin or htt is needed for the proper physiology of nerve cells but the proteins precise role in these cells is not yet understood the dominant disease allele hd specifies a defective htt protein that over time damages nerve cells fig the disease allele is dominant to the normal allele because the presence of the normal htt protein in heterozygotes does not prevent the abnormal protein from damaging the cells it is important to note that this explanation for the huntington disease allele is only one of many different molecular mechanisms that may result in a disease allele that is dominant to the normal allele of a particular gene no effective treatment yet exists for huntington disease and because of its late onset there was until the s no way for children of a huntington parent to know before middle age usually until well after their own childbearing years whether they carried the huntington disease allele hd most people with the disease allele are hd hd heterozygotes so their children would have a probability of inheriting hd and before they are diagnosed a probability of passing the defective allele on to one of their children in the mid s with new knowledge of the gene molecular geneticists developed a dna test that determines whether an individual carries the hd allele this test will be explained in detail in chapter because of the lack of effective treatment for the disease some young adults whose parents died of huntington disease prefer not to be tested so that they will not learn their own fate prematurely however other at risk individuals employ the test for the hd allele to guide their decisions about having children if someone whose parent had huntington disease does not have hd he or she has no chance of developing the disease or of transmitting it to offspring if the test shows the presence of hd the at risk person and his or her partner might choose to conceive a child using in vitro fertilization ivf technology described in chapter that allows for genotyping of early stage embryos using ivf only embryos lacking the hd disease allele would be introduced into the mothers womb the genetics and society box developing guidelines for genetic screening discusses significant social and ethical issues raised by information obtained from family pedigrees and molecular tests figure why the allele for huntington disease is dominant people who are hd hd or hd hd exhibit huntington disease because the hd allele produces an abnormal htt protein that damages nerve cells homozygotes for the normal allele hd hd produce only normal htt protein and do not have the disease the disease allele hd is dominant because even when the normal protein is present in hd hd heterozygotes the abnormal protein damages nerve cells hd hd homozygosity is possible because the abnormal htt protein retains some function of the normal protein a horizontal pattern of inheritance indicates a rare recessive trait unlike huntington disease most confirmed single gene diseases in humans are caused by recessive alleles one reason is that with the exception of late onset traits deleterious dominant alleles are unlikely to be transmitted to the next generation for example if people affected with huntington disease all died by the age of the disease would disappear from the population in contrast individuals can carry one allele for a recessive disease without ever being affected by any symptoms figure shows three pedigrees for cystic fibrosis the most commonly inherited recessive disease among caucasian children in the united states a double dose of the recessive cf allele meaning the absence of a cf allele causes a fatal disorder in which the lungs pancreas and other organs become clogged with a thick viscous mucus that can interfere with breathing and digestion one in every white americans is born with cystic fibrosis and only of them survive into their s note two salient features of the cystic fibrosis pedigrees first the family pattern of people showing the trait is often horizontal the parents grandparents and great grandparents of children born with cystic fibrosis do not themselves manifest the disease while several brothers and sisters in a single generation may a horizontal pedigree pattern is a strong indication that the trait is recessive the unaffected parents are heterozygous carriers they bear a dominant normal allele cf that masks the effects of the recessive abnormal one an estimated million americans are carriers of a recessive cf allele table summarizes some of the clues found in pedigrees that can help you decide whether a trait is caused by a dominant or a recessive allele the second salient feature of the cystic fibrosis pedigrees is that many of the couples who produce afflicted children are blood relatives that is their mating is consanguineous as indicated by the double line in fig a the consanguineous mating in generation v is between third cousins of course children with cystic fibrosis can also have unrelated carrier parents but because relatives share genes their offspring have a much greater than average chance of receiving two copies of a rare allele whether or not they are related carrier parents are both heterozygotes thus among their offspring the proportion of unaffected to affected children is expected to be to look at it another way the chances are that out of children of two heterozygous carriers will be homozygous cystic fibrosis sufferers you can gauge your understanding of this inheritance pattern by assigning a genotype to each person in fig and then checking your answers against the caption note that for several individuals such as the generation i individuals in part a of the figure it is impossible to assign a full genotype we know that one of these people must be the carrier who supplied the original cf allele but we do not know if it was the male or the female as with an ambiguous dominant phenotype in peas the unknown second allele is indicated by a dash in fig a a mating between the unrelated carriers vi and vi produced a child with cystic fibrosis how likely is such a marriage between unrelated carriers for a recessive genetic condition the answer depends on the gene in question and the particular population into which a person is born as table shows the incidence of genetic diseases and thus the frequency of their carriers varies markedly among populations such variation reflects the distinct genetic histories of different groups the area of genetics that analyzes differences among groups of individuals is called population genetics a subject we cover in detail in chapter notice that in fig a several unrelated unaffected people such as ii and ii married into the family under consideration although it is highly probable that these individuals are homozygotes for the normal allele of the gene cf cf a small chance whose magnitude depends on the population exists that any one of them could be a carrier of the disease genetic researchers identified the cystic fibrosis gene in soon after the huntington disease gene was identified the normal dominant cf allele makes a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr cftr protein forms a channel in the cell membranes that controls the flow of chloride ions through lung cells recessive cf disease alleles either produce no cftr or produce nonfunctional or less functional versions of the protein fig because of osmosis water flows into lung cells without cftr while a thick dehydrated mucus builds up outside the cells thus cf cf homozygotes have no functional cftr or not enough of this protein and exhibit cystic fibrosis gene therapy insertion of a normal cf gene into lung cells of patients has been tried to ameliorate the diseases debilitating symptoms but so far without success despite the failure to date of gene therapy identification of the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis has very recently led to effective treatments for the disease in patients with particular mutant alleles for example in the u s food and drug administration approved a drug cocktail called orkambi that helps the particular defective form of cftr specified by one of these alleles to function properly varied approaches to the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other inherited diseases will be discussed later in the book figure cystic fibrosis a recessive condition in a the two affected individuals vi and vii are cf cf that is homozygotes for the recessive disease allele their unaffected parents must be carriers so v v vi and vi must all be cf cf individuals ii ii iii iii iv and iv are probably also carriers we cannot determine which of the founders i or i was a carrier so we designate their genotypes as cf because the cf allele is relatively rare it is likely that ii ii iii iii iv and iv are cf cf homozygotes the genotype of the remaining unaffected people vi vi and vii is uncertain cf b and c these two families demonstrate horizontal patterns of inheritance without further information the unaffected children in each pedigree must be regarded as having a cf genotype developing guidelines for genetic screening should i be screened if a test is available for most inherited diseases no cures presently exist the psychological burden of anticipating a fatal late onset disease for which there is no treatment could be devastating and therefore some people might decide not to be tested others may object to testing for religious reasons or because of confidentiality concerns if a screening program is established who should be tested the answer depends on what the test is trying to accomplish as well as on its expense ultimately the cost of a procedure must be weighed against the usefulness of the data it provides in the united states for example only one tenth as many african americans as caucasians are affected by cystic fibrosis and asians almost never exhibit the disease should all racial groups be tested for cystic fibrosis or only caucasians should private employers and insurance companies be allowed to test their clients and employees some employers advocate genetic screening to reduce the incidence of occupational disease arguing that they can use genetic test results to make sure employees are not assigned to environments that might cause them harm critics of this position say that screening violates workers rights including the right to privacy increases racial and ethnic discrimination in the workplace and provides insurers with an excuse to deny coverage in president george w bush signed into law the genetic information nondiscrimination act which prohibits insurance companies and employers in the united states from discriminating on the basis of information derived from genetic tests finally how should people be educated about the meaning of test results in one small community screening program people identified as carriers of the recessive lifethreatening blood disorder known as thalassemia were ostracized as a result carriers ended up marrying one another only making medical matters worse by contrast in ferrara italy where new cases of thalassemia had been reported every year extensive screening combined with education was so successful that the s passed with only a few new cases of the disease given all of these considerations what kind of guidelines would you like to see established to ensure that genetic screening reaches the right people at the right time and that information gained from such screening is used for the right purposes in the early s the united states launched a national screening program for carriers of sickle cell anemia a recessive genetic disease that afflicts roughly in african americans the disease is caused by a particular allele called hb s of the globin gene the dominant normal allele is hb a the protein determined by the globin gene is one component of the oxygen carrying hemoglobin molecule hb s hb s homozygotes have sickle shaped red blood cells these patients suffer a decrease in oxygen supply tire easily and often develop heart failure from stress on the circulatory system the national screening program for sickle cell anemia was based on a simple test of hemoglobin mobility normal and sickling hemoglobins move at different rates in a gel people who participated in the screening program and found they were carriers could use the test results to make informed reproductive decisions a healthy man for example who learned he was a carrier that is that he was a hb s hb a heterozygote would not have to worry about having an affected child if his mate was a noncarrier the original sickle cell screening program based on detection of the abnormal hemoglobin protein was not an unqualified success largely because of insufficient educational follow through many who learned they were carriers mistakenly thought they had the disease moreover employers and insurance companies that obtained access to the information denied jobs or health insurance to some heterozygotes for no acceptable reason problems of public relations and education thus made a reliable screening test into a source of dissent and alienation today at risk families may be screened for a growing number of genetic disorders thanks to the ability to evaluate genotypes directly the need to establish guidelines for genetic screening thus becomes more and more pressing several related questions reveal the complexity of the issue why carry out genetic screening at all the first reason for screening is to obtain information that will benefit individuals for example if you learn at an early age that you have a genetic predisposition to heart disease you can change your lifestyle to improve your chances of staying healthy you can also use the results from genetic screening to make informed reproductive decisions the second reason for genetic screening which often conflicts with the first is to benefit groups within society insurance companies and employers for example would like to know who is at risk for various genetic conditions table how to recognize dominant and recessive traits in pedigrees dominant traits affected children always have at least one affected parent dominant traits show a vertical pattern of inheritance the trait shows up in every generation two affected parents can produce unaffected children if both parents are heterozygotes recessive traits affected individuals can be the children of two unaffected carriers particularly as a result of consanguineous matings all the children of two affected parents should be affected rare recessive traits show a horizontal pattern of inheritance the trait first appears among several members of one generation and is not seen in earlier generations recessive traits may show a vertical pattern of inheritance if the trait is extremely common in the population figure why the allele for cystic fibrosis is recessive the cftr protein regulates the passage of chloride ions green spheres through the cell membrane people who are homozygous for a cystic fibrosis disease allele cf cf have the disease because recessive disease alleles either specify no cftr protein as shown or encode abnormal cftr proteins that do not function at all or do not function as well as the normal protein not shown disease alleles cf are recessive because cf cf heterozygotes produce cftr from the normal cf allele and this amount of cftr is sufficient for normal lung function cf cf or cf cf cf cf inside of the cell outside of the cell mucus cystic fibrosis cl ions inside of the cell outside of the cell normal lipid bilayer of cell membrane cftr protein in a vertical pattern of transmission a trait that appears in an affected individual also appears in at least one parent one of the affected parents parents and so on if a trait is rare a pedigree with a vertical pattern usually indicates that the disease causing allele is dominant in a horizontal pattern of transmission a trait that appears in an affected individual may not appear in any ancestors but it may appear in some of the persons siblings a pedigree with a horizontal pattern usually indicates a rare recessive disease causing allele affected individuals are often products of consanguineous mating various kinds of biochemical events may explain why some disease alleles are dominant in the case of huntington disease the disease causing hd allele specifies an abnormal deleterious version of the protein produced by the normal recessive allele recessive disease alleles like the cf alleles that cause cystic fibrosis usually specify either no protein or less functional versions of the protein that the normal dominant allele produces mendel answered the three basic questions about heredity as follows to what is inherited he replied alleles of genes to how is it inherited he responded according to the principles of segregation and independent assortment and to what is the role of chance in heredity he said for each individual inheritance is determined by chance but within a population this chance operates in a context of strictly defined probabilities within a decade of the rediscovery of mendels work numerous breeding studies had shown that mendels laws hold true not only for seven pairs of antagonistic characteristics in peas but also for many diverse traits in a wide variety of sexually reproducing plant and animal species some of these same breeding studies however raised a challenge to the new genetics for certain traits in certain species the studies uncovered unanticipated phenotypic ratios or the results included f and f progeny with novel phenotypes that resembled those of neither pure breeding parent these phenomena could not be explained by mendels hypothesis that for each gene two alternative alleles one completely dominant the other recessive determine a single trait we now know that most common traits including skin color eye color and height in humans are determined by interactions between two or more genes we also know that within a given population more than two alleles may be present for some of those genes chapter shows how the genetic analysis of such complex traits that is traits produced by complex interactions between genes and between genes and the environment extended rather than contradicted mendels laws of inheritance solving genetics problems the best way to evaluate and increase your understanding of the material in the chapter is to apply your knowledge in solving genetics problems genetics word problems are like puzzles take them in slowly dont be overwhelmed by the whole problem identify useful facts given in the problem and use the facts to deduce additional information use genetic principles and logic to work toward the solutions the more problems you do the easier they become in solving problems you will not only solidify your understanding of genetic concepts but you will also develop basic analytical skills that are applicable in many disciplines note that some of the problems at the end of each chapter are designed to introduce supplementary but important concepts that expand on the information in the text you can nonetheless answer such problems using logical inferences from your reading solving genetics problems requires much more than simply plugging numbers into formulas each problem is unique and requires thoughtful evaluation of the information given and the question being asked the following are general guidelines you can follow in approaching these word problems a read through the problem once to get some sense of the concepts involved b go back through the problem noting all the information supplied to you for example genotypes or phenotypes of offspring or parents may be given to you or implied in the problem represent the known information in a symbolic format assign symbols for alleles use these symbols to indicate genotypes make a diagram of the crosses including genotypes and phenotypes given or implied be sure that you do not assign different letters of the alphabet to two alleles of the same gene as this can cause confusion also be careful to discriminate clearly between the upper and lowercases of letters such as c c or s s c now reassess the question and work toward the solution using the information given make sure you answer the question being asked d when you finish the problem check to see that the answer makes sense you can often check solutions by working backwards that is see if you can reconstruct the data from your answer e after you have completed a question and checked your answer spend a minute to think about which major concepts were involved in the solution this is a critical step for improving your understanding of genetics for each chapter the logic involved in solving two or three types of problems is described in detail i in cats white patches are caused by the dominant allele p while pp individuals are solid colored short hair is caused by a dominant allele s while ss cats have long hair a long haired cat with patches whose mother was solid colored and short haired mates with a short haired solid colored cat whose mother was long haired and solid colored what kinds of kittens can arise from this mating and in what proportions answer the solution to this problem requires an understanding of dominance recessiveness gamete formation and the independent assortment of alleles of two genes in a cross first make a representation of the known information mothers solid short haired solid long haired cross cat cat patches long haired solid short haired what genotypes can you assign any cat showing a recessive phenotype must be homozygous for the recessive allele therefore the long haired cats are ss solid cats are pp cat is long haired so it must be homozygous for the recessive allele ss this cat has the dominant phenotype of patches and could be either pp or pp but because the mother was pp and could only contribute a p allele in her gametes cat must be pp cat s full genotype is pp ss similarly cat is solid colored so it must be homozygous for the recessive allele pp because this cat is shorthaired it could have either the ss or ss genotype its mother was long haired ss and could only contribute an s allele in her gamete so cat must be heterozygous ss the full genotype is pp ss the cross is therefore between pp ss cat and pp ss cat to determine the types of kittens first establish the types of gametes that can be produced by each cat and then set up a punnett square to determine the genotypes of the offspring cat pp ss produces ps and ps gametes in equal proportions cat pp ss produces ps and ps gametes in equal proportions four types of kittens can result from this mating with equal probability pp ss patches short haired pp ss patches long haired pp ss solid short haired and pp ss solid long haired the following table demonstrates that you could also work through this problem using the product rule of probability instead of a punnett square the principles are the same gametes produced in equal amounts by either parent are combined at random cat cat gamete gamete progeny p s p s pp ss patches short haired p s p s pp ss patches long haired p s p s pp ss solid colored short haired p s p s pp ss solid colored long haired in tomatoes red fruit is dominant to yellow fruit and purple stems are dominant to green stems the progeny from one mating consisted of red fruit purple stem plants red fruit green stem plants yellow fruit purple stem plants and yellow fruit green stem plants what were the genotypes of the parents in this cross answer this problem requires an understanding of independent assortment in a dihybrid cross as well as the ratios predicted from monohybrid crosses designate the alleles r red r yellow p purple stems p green stems in genetics problems the ratios of offspring can indicate the genotype of parents you will usually need to total the number of progeny and approximate the ratio of offspring in each of the different classes for this problem in which the inheritance of two traits is given consider each trait independently for red fruit there are red fruited plants out of a total of plants this value is close to about of the plants have yellow fruit from mendels work you know that a phenotypic ratio results from crosses between plants that are hybrid heterozygous for one gene therefore the genotype for fruit color of each parent must have been rr for stem color or plants had purple stems about half had purple stems and the other half had green stems a phenotypic ratio occurs when a heterozygote is mated to a homozygous recessive as in a testcross the parents genotypes must have been pp and pp for stem color the complete genotype of the parent plants in this cross was rr pp rr pp iii tay sachs is a recessive lethal disease in which there is neurological deterioration early in life this disease is rare in the population overall but is found at relatively high frequency in ashkenazi jews from eastern europe a woman whose maternal uncle had the disease is trying to determine the probability that she and her husband could have an affected child her father does not come from a high risk population her husbands sister died of the disease at an early age a draw the pedigree of the individuals described include the genotypes where possible b determine the probability that the couples first child will be affected answer this problem requires an understanding of dominance recessiveness and probability first diagram the pedigree and then assign as many genotypes as possible using the following allele designations t normal allele t tay sachs allele a ected uncle a ected sister tttt tt tt tt tt tt i ii iii the genotypes of the two affected individuals the womans uncle ii and the husbands sister iii are tt because the uncle was affected both of his parents must have been heterozygous similarly as the husbands sister iii is affected both of her parents ii and ii must be heterozygotes finally because individual ii is not from a high risk population the most likely assumption is that he is tt you next need to determine the chance that a child of iii and iii that is individual iv would have taysachs tt for that to be possible both iii and iii must be tt given that neither is tt for iii to be tt ii must be tt calculating the chance that ii is tt is a bit tricky at first it appears that the chance is that the daughter of two heterozygous tt parents would be tt the expected progeny ratio is tt tt tt however in this case you have additional information to consider ii is unaffected and thus the genotype tt is ruled out that leaves tt tt or a chance that ii is tt if so the chance that ii would transmit the t allele to iii is thus the probability that iii is tt is this fact implies that ii could be either tt probability or tt probability if ii is tt the chance that she would transmit the t allele to iii is thus the probability that iii is tt is what is the chance that iii is tt both of his parents are heterozygous and he is unaffected thus using similar logic the likelihood that iii is tt is the probability that both iii and iii are tt is the chance that the child of two tt parents would be tt is thus the overall likelihood that iv the child of iii and iii would have tay sachs is vocabulary for each of the terms in the left column choose the best matching phrase in the

breeding was practiced why did breeders fail to uncover the principle that traits are governed by discrete units of inheritance that is by genes describe the characteristics of the garden pea that made it a good organism for mendels analysis of the basic principles of inheritance evaluate how easy or difficult it would be to make a similar study of inheritance in humans by considering the same attributes you described for the pea section an albino corn snake is crossed with a normal colored corn snake the offspring are all normal colored when these first generation progeny snakes are crossed among themselves they produce normalcolored snakes and albino snakes a how do you know that only a single gene is responsible for the color differences between these snakes b which of these phenotypes is controlled by the dominant allele c a normal colored female snake is involved in a testcross this cross produces normal colored and albino offspring what are the genotypes of the parents and the offspring two short haired cats mate and produce six shorthaired and two long haired kittens what does this information suggest about how hair length is inherited piebald spotting is a condition found in humans in which there are patches of skin that lack pigmentation the condition results from the inability of pigment producing cells to migrate properly during development two adults with piebald spotting have one child who has this trait and a second child with normal skin pigmentation a is the piebald spotting trait dominant or recessive what information led you to this answer b what are the genotypes of the parents as a drosophila research geneticist you keep stocks of flies of specific genotypes you have a fly that has normal wings dominant phenotype flies with short wings are homozygous for a recessive allele of the wing length gene you need to know if this fly with normal wings is pure breeding or heterozygous for the wing length trait what cross would you do to determine the genotype and what results would you expect for each possible genotype a mutant cucumber plant has flowers that fail to open when mature crosses can be done with this plant by manually opening and pollinating the flowers with pollen from another plant when closed open crosses were done all the f progeny were open the f plants were open and closed a cross of closed f gave open and closed how is the closed trait inherited what evidence led you to your conclusion in a particular population of mice certain individuals display a phenotype called short tail which is inherited as a dominant trait some individuals display a recessive trait called dilute which affects coat color which of these traits would be easier to eliminate from the population by selective breeding why in humans a dimple in the chin is a dominant characteristic controlled by a single gene a a man who does not have a chin dimple has children with a woman with a chin dimple whose mother lacked the dimple what proportion of their children would be expected to have a chin dimple b a man with a chin dimple and a woman who lacks the dimple produce a child who lacks a dimple what is the mans genotype c a man with a chin dimple and a nondimpled woman produce eight children all having the chin dimple can you be certain of the mans genotype why or why not what genotype is more likely and why some inbred strains of the weedy plant arabidopsis thaliana flower early in the growing season but other strains flower at later times four different arabdiposis plants were crossed and the resulting progeny were tabulated as follows mating progeny late early late late early late late early late explain the genetic basis for the difference in flowering time how do you know that among this group of plants the flowering time trait is influenced by the action of a single gene which allele is dominant and which recessive b ascribe genotypes to the four plants c what kinds of progeny would you expect if you allowed plants to self fertilize and in what ratios among native americans two types of earwax cerumen are seen dry and sticky a geneticist studied the inheritance of this

delivers twin foals one red and one black can you tell from these results how color is inherited assuming that alternative alleles of a single gene are involved what crosses could you do to determine

plants yellow and round are dominant traits a third grader decided to breed guinea pigs for her school science project she went to a pet store and bought a male with smooth black fur and a female with rough white fur she wanted to study the inheritance of those features and was sorry to see that the first litter of eight contained only rough black animals to her disappointment the second litter from those same parents contained seven rough black animals soon the first litter had begun to produce f offspring and they showed a variety of coat types before long the child had f guinea pigs eight of them had smooth white coats had smooth black coats were rough and white and were rough and black a how are the coat color and texture characteristics inherited what evidence supports your conclusions b what phenotypes and proportions of offspring should the girl expect if she mates one of the smooth white f females to an f male the self fertilization of an f pea plant produced from a parent plant homozygous for yellow and wrinkled seeds and a parent homozygous for green and round seeds resulted in a pod containing seven f peas yellow and round are dominant what is the probability

the following genes and mutations are known wing size recessive allele for tiny wings t dominant allele for normal wings t eye shape recessive allele for narrow eyes n dominant allele for normal oval

fruit fly with genotype tt nn is mated to a male of genotype tt nn what is the probability that any one of their offspring will have normal phenotypes for both characters b what phenotypes would you expect among the offspring of this cross if you obtained progeny how many of each phenotypic class would you expect considering the yellow and green pea color phenotypes studied by gregor mendel a what is the biochemical function of the protein that is specified by the gene responsible for the pea color phenotype b a null allele of a gene is an allele that does not specify any of the biochemical function that the gene normally provides of the two alleles y and y which is more likely to be a null allele c in terms of the underlying biochemistry why is the y allele dominant to the y allele d why are peas that are yy homozygotes green e the amount of the protein specified by a gene is roughly proportional to the number of functional copies of the gene carried by a cell or individual what do the phenotypes of yy homozygotes yy heterozygotes and yy homozygotes tell us about the amount of the sgr enzyme the product of the pea color gene needed to produce a yellow color the sgr enzyme is not needed for the survival of a pea plant but the genomes of organisms contain many so called essential genes needed for an individuals survival for such genes heterozygotes for the normal allele and the null allele survive but individuals homozygous for the null allele die soon after the male and female gametes each with a null allele come together at fertilization in light of your answer to part e what does this fact tell you about the advantage to an organism of having two copies of their genes g do you think that a single pea pod could contain peas with different phenotypes explain h do you think that a pea pod could be of one color say green while the peas within the pod could be of a different color say yellow explain what would have been the outcome the genotypic and phenotypic ratios in the f of mendels dihybrid cross shown in fig if the alleles of the pea color gene y y and the pea shape gene r r did not assort independently and instead the alleles inherited from a parent always stayed together as a unit recall that mendel obtained pure breeding plants with either long or short stems and that hybrids had long stems fig monohybrid crosses produced an f generation with a ratio of long stems to short stems indicating that this difference in stem length is governed by a single gene the gene that likely controlled this trait in mendels plants has been discovered and it specifies an enzyme called g h which catalyzes the reaction shown in the accompanying figure the product of the reaction gibberellin is a growth hormone that makes plants grow tall what is the most likely hypothesis to explain the difference between the dominant allele l and the recessive allele l g h precursor gibberellin co h o h co h co h o h h ho the gene that likely controlled flower color purple or white in mendels pea plants has also been identified the flower color gene specifies a protein called bhlh required by cells to make three different enzymes dfr ans and gt that function in the pathway shown in the accompanying figure leading to synthesis of the purple pigment anthocyanin a what is the most likely explanation for the difference between the dominant allele p and the recessive allele p of the gene responsible for these flower colors b given the biochemical pathway shown could a different gene have been the one governing mendels flower colors for each of the following human pedigrees indicate whether the inheritance pattern is recessive or dominant what feature s of the pedigree did you use to determine the mode of inheritance give the genotypes of affected individuals and of individuals who carry the disease allele but are not affected consider the pedigree that follows for cutis laxa a connective tissue disorder in which the skin hangs in loose folds a assuming that the trait is rare what is the apparent mode of inheritance b what is the probability that individual ii is a carrier c what is the probability that individual ii is a carrier what is the probability that individual iii is affected by the disease i ii iii a young couple went to see a genetic counselor because each had a sibling with cystic fibrosis cystic fibrosis is a recessive disease and neither member of the couple nor any of their four parents is affected a what is the probability that the female of this couple is a carrier b what are the chances that their child will have cystic fibrosis c what is the probability that their child will be a carrier of the cystic fibrosis disease allele huntington disease is a rare fatal degenerative neurological disease in which individuals start to show symptoms in their s it is caused by a dominant allele joe a man in his s just learned that his father has huntington disease a what is the probability that joe will also develop the disease b joe and his new wife have been eager to start a family what is the probability that their first child will eventually develop the disease is the disease shown in the following pedigree caused by a dominant or a recessive allele why based on this limited pedigree do you think the disease allele is rare or common in the population why figure shows the inheritance of huntington disease in a family from a small village near lake maracaibo in venezuela the village was founded by a small number of immigrants and generations of their descendants have remained concentrated in this isolated location the allele for huntington disease has remained unusually prevalent there a why could you not conclude definitively that the disease is the result of a dominant or a recessive allele solely by looking at this pedigree b is there any information you could glean from the familys history that might imply the disease is due to a dominant rather than a recessive allele consider the cystic fibrosis pedigree in figure a a assuming that one of the individuals in generation i was a carrier and that no one from outside the family was a carrier what was the probability that any single child of the consanguineous couple in generation v would have cystic fibrosis assume that none of their children is born yet so you dont know that vi has the disease b assuming that one of the individuals in generation i was a carrier and that people in the population is a carrier and knowing that vi has the disease how likely was it that vii would be affected the common grandfather of two first cousins has hereditary hemochromatosis a recessive condition causing an abnormal buildup of iron in the body neither of the cousins has the disease nor do any of their relatives a if the first cousins had a child what is the chance that the child would have hemochromatosis assume that the unrelated unaffected parents of the cousins are not carriers b how would your calculation change if you knew that out of every unaffected people in the population including the unrelated parents of these cousins was a carrier for hemochromatosis people with nail patella syndrome have poorly developed or absent kneecaps and nails individuals with alkaptonuria have arthritis as well as urine that darkens when exposed to air both nail patella syndrome and alkaptonuria are rare phenotypes in the following pedigree vertical red lines indicate individuals with nail patella syndrome while horizontal green lines denote individuals with alkaptonuria a what are the most likely modes of inheritance of nail patella syndrome and alkaptonuria what genotypes can you ascribe to each of the individuals in the pedigree for both of these phenotypes b in a mating between iv and iv what is the chance that the child produced would have both nail patella syndrome and alkaptonuria nailpatella syndrome alone alkaptonuria alone neither defect midphalangeal hair hair on top of the middle segment of the fingers is a common phenotype caused by a dominant allele m homozygotes for the recessive allele mm lack hair on the middle segment

and a normal woman have two children a what is the probability that only the second child has the disease b what is the probability that only one of the children has the disease c what is the probability that none of the children has the disease d answer a through c assuming that the couple had children e what is the probability that of the children in the family in d have the disease explain why disease alleles for cystic fibrosis cf are recessive to the normal alleles cf yet the disease alleles responsible for huntington disease hd are dominant to the normal alleles hd the following pedigree shows the inheritance of red hair in a family in scotland red hair is caused by homozygosity for a recessive allele of a gene called mc r although worldwide red hair is the rarest of human hair colors red hair is not uncommon in scotland in fact of scots without red hair are nonetheless carriers of the red hair allele why does red hair show a horizontal inheritance pattern in

chromosomes carries hundreds of genes adrian t sumner chromosomes the carriers of genes sex chromosomes and sex determination mitosis cell division that preserves chromosome number meiosis cell divisions that halve chromosome number gametogenesis validation of the chromosome theory sex linked and sexually dimorphic traits in humans in the spherical membrane bound nuclei of plant and animal cells prepared for viewing under the microscope chromosomes appear as brightly colored threadlike bodies the nuclei of normal human cells carry pairs of chromosomes for a total of noticeable differences in size and shape exist among the pairs but within each pair the two chromosomes appear to match exactly the only exceptions are the males sex chromosomes designated x and y which constitute an unmatched pair down syndrome was the first human genetic disorder attributable not to a gene mutation but to an abnormal number of chromosomes children born with down syndrome have chromosomes in each somatic cell nucleus because they carry three instead of the normal pair of a very small chromosome referred to as number the aberrant genotype called trisomy gives rise to an abnormal phenotype including a wide skull that is flatter than normal at the back an unusually large tongue learning disabilities caused by the abnormal development of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain and a propensity to respiratory infections as well as heart disorders rapid aging and leukemia fig how can one extra copy of a chromosome that is itself of normal size and shape cause such wide ranging phenotypic effects the answer has two parts first and foremost chromosomes are the cellular structures responsible for transmitting genetic information in this chapter we describe how geneticists concluded that chromosomes are the carriers of genes an idea that became known as the chromosome theory of inheritance the second part of the answer is that proper development depends not just on what type of genetic material is present but also on how much of it there is thus the mechanisms governing gene transmission during cell division must vigilantly maintain each cells chromosome number cell division proceeds through the precise chromosome parceling mechanisms of mitosis for somatic or body cells and meiosis for gametes eggs and sperm when the machinery does not function properly errors in chromosome distribution can have dire repercussions on the individuals health and survival down syndrome for example is the result of a failure of chromosome segregation during meiosis the meiotic error gives rise to an egg or sperm carrying an extra chromosome which if incorporated in the zygote at fertilization is passed on via mitosis to every cell of the developing embryo trisomy three copies of a chromosome instead of two can occur with other chromosomes as well but in nearly all of these cases the condition is prenatally lethal and results in a miscarriage two themes emerge in our discussion of meiosis and mitosis first direct microscopic observations of chromosomes during gamete formation led early twentieth century investigators to recognize that chromosome movements parallel the behavior of mendels genes so chromosomes are likely to carry the genetic material this chromosome theory of inheritance was proposed in and was confirmed in the following years through elegant experiments performed mainly using the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster second the chromosome theory transformed the concept of a gene from an abstract particle to a physical reality part of a chromosome that could be seen and manipulated figure down syndrome one extra chromosome has widespread phenotypic consequences trisomy usually causes changes in physical appearance as well as in the potential for learning many children with down syndrome such as the fifth grader at the center of the photograph can participate fully in regular activities richard hutchings chromosomes the carriers of genes learning objectives differentiate among somatic cells gametes and zygotes with regard to the number and origin of their chromosomes distinguish between homologous and nonhomologous chromosomes list the differences between sister chromatids and nonsister chromatids one of the first questions asked at the birth of an infant is it a boy or a girl acknowledges that male and female normally are mutually exclusive characteristics like the yellow versus green of mendels peas whats more among humans and most other sexually reproducing species a roughly ratio exists between the two sexes both males and females produce cells specialized for reproduction sperm or eggs that serve as a physical link to the next generation in bridging the gap between generations these gametes must each contribute half of the genetic material for making a normal healthy son or daughter whatever part of the gamete carries this material its structure and function must be able to account for the either or aspect of sex determination as well as the generally observed ratio of males to females these two features of sex determination were among the earliest clues to the cellular basis of heredity genes reside in the nucleus the nature of the specific link between sex and reproduction remained a mystery until anton van leeuwenhoek one of the earliest and most astute of microscopists discovered in that semen contains spermatozoa literally sperm animals he imagined that these microscopic creatures might enter the egg and somehow achieve fertilization but it was not possible to confirm this hypothesis for another years then during a year period starting in about the same time gregor mendel was beginning his pea experiments microscopists studying fertilization in frogs and sea urchins observed the union of male and female gametes and recorded the details of the process in a series of drawings these drawings as well as later micrographs photographs taken through a microscope clearly show that egg and sperm nuclei are the only elements contributed equally by maternal and paternal gametes this observation implies that something in the nucleus contains the hereditary material in humans the nuclei of the gametes are less than millionths of a meter in diameter it is indeed remarkable that the genetic link between generations is packaged within such an exceedingly small space genes reside in chromosomes further investigations some dependent on technical innovations in microscopy suggested that yet smaller discrete structures within the nucleus are the repository of genetic information in the s for example a newly discovered combination of organic and inorganic dyes revealed the existence of the long brightly staining threadlike bodies within the nucleus that we call chromosomes literally colored bodies it was now possible to follow the movement of chromosomes during different kinds of cell division in embryonic cells the chromosomal threads split lengthwise in two just before cell division and each of the two newly forming daughter cells receives one half of every split thread the kind of nuclear division followed by cell division that results in two daughter cells containing the same number and type of chromosomes as the original parent cell is called mitosis from the greek mitos meaning thread and osis meaning formation or increase in the cells that give rise to male and female gametes the chromosomes composing each pair become segregated so that the resulting gametes receive only one chromosome from each chromosome pair the kind of nuclear division that generates egg or sperm cells containing half the number of chromosomes found in other cells within the same organism is called meiosis from the greek word for diminution fertilization the union of haploid gametes to produce diploid zygotes in the first decade of the twentieth century cytologists scientists who use the microscope to study cell structure showed that the chromosomes in a fertilized egg actually consist of two matching sets one contributed by the maternal gamete the other by the paternal gamete the corresponding maternal and paternal chromosomes appear alike in size and shape forming pairs with one exception the sex chromosomes which we discuss in a later section gametes and other cells that carry only a single set of chromosomes are called haploid from the greek word for single zygotes and other cells carrying two matching sets are diploid from the greek word for double the number of chromosomes in a normal haploid cell is designated by the shorthand symbol n the number of chromosomes in a normal diploid cell is then n figure shows diploid cells as well as the haploid gametes that arise from them in drosophila where n and n in humans n n you can see how the halving of chromosome number during meiosis and gamete formation followed by the union of two gametes chromosomes at fertilization normally allows a constant n number of chromosomes to be maintained from generation to generation in all individuals of a species the chromosomes of every pair must segregate from each other during meiosis so that the haploid gametes will each have one complete set of chromosomes after fertilization forms the zygote the process of mitosis then ensures that all the somatic cells of the developing individual have identical diploid chromosome sets species variations in the number and shape of chromosomes scientists analyze the chromosomal makeup of a cell when the chromosomes are most visible at a specific moment in the cell cycle of growth and division just before the nucleus divides at this point known as metaphase described in detail later individual chromosomes have duplicated and condensed from thin threads into compact rodlike structures each chromosome now consists of two identical halves known as sister chromatids fig the specific location at which sister chromatids are attached to each other is called the centromere each sister chromatid has its own centromere fig but in the duplicated chromosome the two sister centromeres are pulled together so tightly that they form a constriction within which they cannot be resolved from each other even in images obtained in the scanning electron microscope see the picture at the beginning of the chapter diploid versus haploid n versus n fruit fly somatic cells are diploid they carry a maternal and paternal copy of each chromosome meiosis generates haploid gametes with only one copy of each chromosome in drosophila diploid cells have eight chromosomes n while gametes have four chromosomes n note that the chromosomes in this diagram are pictured before their replication the x and y chromosomes determine the sex of the individual drosophila melanogaster figure metaphase chromosomes can be classified by centromere position before cell division each chromosome replicates into two sister chromatids connected at their centromeres in highly condensed metaphase chromosomes the centromeres can appear near the middle a metacentric chromosome very near an end an acrocentric chromosome or anywhere in between in a diploid cell one homologous chromosome in each pair is from the mother and the other from the father figure karyotype of a human male photos of metaphase human chromosomes are paired and arranged in order of decreasing size in a normal human male karyotype pairs of autosomes are present as well as an x and a y n homologous chromosomes share the same characteristic pattern of dark and light bands pair of homologous metacentric chromosomes centromere centromere sister chromatids homologous chromosomes homologous chromosomes pair of homologous acrocentric chromosomes nonsister chromatids nonhomologous chromosomes geneticists often describe chromosomes according to the location of the centromere fig in metacentric chromosomes the centromere is more or less in the middle in acrocentric chromosomes the centromere is very close to one end chromosomes thus always have two arms separated by a centromere but the relative sizes of the two arms can vary in different chromosomes cells in metaphase can be fixed and stained with one of several dyes that highlight the chromosomes and accentuate the centromeres the dyes also produce characteristic banding patterns made up of lighter and darker regions chromosomes that match in size shape and banding are called homologous chromosomes or homologs the two homologs of each pair contain the same set of genes although for some of those genes they may carry different alleles the differences between alleles occur at the molecular level and dont show up in the microscope figure introduces a system of notation employed throughout this book using color to indicate degrees of relatedness between chromosomes thus sister chromatids which are identical duplicates appear in the same shade of the same color homologous chromosomes which carry the same genes but may vary in the identity of particular alleles are pictured in different shades light or dark of the same color nonhomologous chromosomes which carry completely unrelated sets of genetic information appear in different colors to study the chromosomes of a single organism geneticists arrange micrographs of the stained chromosomes in homologous pairs of decreasing size to produce a karyotype karyotype assembly can now be speeded and automated by computerized image analysis figure shows the karyotype of a human male with chromosomes arranged in matching pairs of chromosomes and one nonmatching pair the chromosomes in matching pairs are known as autosomes the two unmatched chromosomes in this male karyotype are called sex chromosomes because they determine the sex of the individual we discuss sex chromosomes in more detail in subsequent sections modern methods of dna analysis can reveal differences between the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes of a homologous pair and can thus track the origin of the extra chromosome that causes down syndrome in individual patients in of cases the third chromosome comes from the egg in from the sperm the genetics and society box entitled prenatal genetic diagnosis describes how physicians use karyotype analysis and a technique called amniocentesis to diagnose down syndrome prenatally roughly three months after a fetus is conceived through thousands of karyotypes on normal individuals cytologists have verified that the cells of each species carry a distinctive diploid number of chromosomes for example mendels peas contain chromosomes in pairs in each diploid cell the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster carries chromosomes pairs macaroni wheat has pairs giant sequoia trees pairs goldfish pairs dogs pairs and people pairs differences in the size shape and number of chromosomes reflect differences in the assembled genetic material that determines what each species looks like and how it functions as these figures show the number of chromosomes does not always correlate with the size or complexity of the organism in the next section you will see that the discovery that chromosomes carry information about an individuals sex led to the realization that chromosomes carry the genes that determine all traits prenatal genetic diagnosis the availability of amniocentesis and cell free fetal dna analysis for prenatal diagnosis is intimately entwined with the personal and societal issue of abortion the large majority of amniocentesis procedures are performed with the understanding that a fetus whose genotype indicates a genetic disorder such as down syndrome will be aborted some prospective parents who are opposed to abortion still elect to undergo amniocentesis so that they can better prepare for an affected child but this is rare the ethical and political aspects of the abortion debate influence many of the practical questions underlying prenatal diagnosis for example parents must decide which genetic conditions would be sufficiently severe that they would be willing to abort the fetus from the economic point of view society must decide who should pay for prenatal diagnosis procedures in current practice the risks and costs of amniocentesis generally restrict its application to women over age or to mothers whose fetuses are at high risk for a testable genetic condition because of family history the personal and societal equations determining the frequency of prenatal testing may however need to be overhauled in the not too distant future because technological advances such as the analysis of cell free fetal dna will minimize the costs and risks with new technologies for observing chromosomes and the dna in genes modern geneticists can define an individuals genotype directly doctors can use this basic strategy to diagnose before birth whether or not a baby will be born with a genetic condition the methods first developed for prenatal diagnosis were to obtain fetal cells whose dna and chromosomes could be analyzed for genotype the most frequently used method for acquiring these cells is amniocentesis fig a to carry out this procedure a doctor inserts a needle through a pregnant womans abdominal wall into the amniotic sac in which the fetus is growing this procedure is performed about weeks after the womans last menstrual period by using ultrasound imaging to guide the location of the needle the doctor then withdraws some of the amniotic fluid in which the fetus is suspended into a syringe this fluid contains living cells called amniocytes that were shed by the fetus when placed in a culture medium these fetal cells undergo several rounds of mitosis and increase in number once enough fetal cells are available clinicians look at the chromosomes and genes in those cells in later chapters we describe techniques that allow the direct examination of the dna constituting particular disease genes amniocentesis also allows the diagnosis of down syndrome through the analysis of chromosomes by karyotyping because the risk of down syndrome increases rapidly with the age of the mother more than half the pregnant women in north america who are over the age of currently undergo amniocentesis although the goal of this karyotyping is usually to learn whether the fetus is trisomic for chromosome many other abnormalities in chromosome number or shape may show up when the karyotype is examined more recently scientists have been able to analyze the genotype of fetuses from the mothers blood bypassing the need to obtain fetal cells this procedure is made possible because the mothers blood contains cell free fetal dna fetal cells leak into the mothers bloodstream and then break down releasing their dna modern dna sequencing techniques allow geneticists not only to genotype this material for particular disease associated alleles but even to determine the fetuss entire genome sequence the analysis of fetal dna obtained from the mothers blood is still experimental but it likely will replace amniocentesis in the near future because drawing blood from the mother is inexpensive and noninvasive the normal risk of miscarriage at weeks gestation is about and amniocentesis increases that risk by about about in precedures in contrast analyzing cell free dna from the mothers blood cannot harm the fetus obtaining fetal cells by amniocentesis a physician guides the insertion of the needle into the amniotic sac aided by ultrasound imaging and extracts amniotic fluid containing fetal cells into the syringe chromosomes are cellular structures specialized for the storage and transmission of genetic material genes are located on chromosomes and travel with them during cell division and gamete formation somatic cells carry a precise number of homologous pairs of chromosomes which is characteristic of the species in diploid organisms one homolog of a pair is of maternal origin and the other paternal sex chromosomes and sex determination learning objectives predict the sex of humans with different complements of x and y chromosomes describe the basis of sex reversal in humans compare the means of sex determination in different organisms figure the x and y chromosomes determine sex in humans a this colorized micrograph shows the human x chromosome on the left and the human y on the right b children can receive only an x chromosome from their mother but they can inherit either an x or a y from their father walter s sutton a young american graduate student at columbia university in the first decade of the twentieth century was one of the earliest cytologists to realize that particular chromosomes carry the information for determining sex in one study he obtained cells from the testes of the great lubber grasshopper brachystola magna fig and followed them through the meiotic divisions that produce sperm he observed that prior to meiosis precursor cells within the testes of a great lubber grasshopper contain a total of chromosomes of these are found in matched pairs and are thus autosomes the remaining two chromosomes are unmatched he called the larger of these the x chromosome and the smaller the y chromosome after meiosis the sperm produced within these testes are of two equally prevalent types one half have a set of autosomes plus an x chromosome while the other half have a set of autosomes plus a y by comparison all of the eggs produced by females of the species carry an plus x set of chromosomes like the set found in the first class of sperm when a sperm with an x chromosome fertilizes an egg an xx female grasshopper results when a y containing sperm fuses with an egg an xy male develops sutton concluded that the x and y chromosomes determine sex figure the great lubber grasshopper in this mating pair the smaller male is astride the female several researchers studying other organisms soon verified that in many sexually reproducing species two distinct chromosomes known as the sex chromosomes provide the basis of sex determination one sex carries two copies of the same chromosome a matching pair while the other sex has one of each type of sex chromosome an unmatched pair the cells of normal human females for example contain pairs of chromosomes the two chromosomes of each pair including the sex determining x chromosomes appear to be identical in size and shape in males however one unmatched pair of chromosomes is present the larger of these is the x the smaller the y fig and fig a apart from this difference in sex chromosomes the two sexes are not distinguishable at any other pair of chromosomes thus geneticists can designate women as xx and men as xy and represent sexual reproduction as a simple cross between xx and xy if sex is an inherited trait determined by a pair of sex chromosomes that separate to different cells during gamete formation then an xx xy cross could account for both the mutual exclusion of sexes and the near ratio of males to females which are hallmark features of sex determination fig b and if chromosomes carry information defining the two contrasting sex phenotypes we can easily infer that chromosomes also carry genetic information specifying other characteristics as well in humans the sry gene determines maleness you have just seen that humans and other mammals have a pair of sex chromosomes that are identical in the xx female but different in the xy male several studies have shown that in humans it is the presence or absence of the y that actually makes the difference that is any person carrying a y chromosome will look like a male for example rare humans with two x and one y chromosome xxy are males displaying certain abnormalities collectively called klinefelter syndrome klinefelter males are typically tall thin and sterile and they sometimes show mental retardation that these individuals are males shows that two x chromosomes are insufficient for female development in the presence of a y in contrast humans carrying an x and no second sex chromosome xo are females with turner syndrome turner females are usually sterile lack secondary sexual characteristics such as pubic hair are of short stature and have folds of skin between their necks and shoulders webbed necks even though these individuals have only one x chromosome they develop as females because they have no y chromosome in researchers discovered that it is not the entire y chromosome but rather a single y chromosome specific gene called sry sex determining region of y that is the primary determinant of maleness the evidence implicating sry came from so called sex reversal the existence of xx males and xy females fig in many sex reversed xx males one of the two x chromosomes carries a portion of the y chromosome although in different xx males different portions of the y chromosome are found on the x one particular gene sry is always present sex reversed xy females in contrast always have a y chromosome lacking a functional sry gene the portion of the y chromosome containing sry is either replaced by a portion of the x chromosome or the y contains a nonfunctional mutant copy of sry fig later experiments with mice confirmed that sry indeed determines maleness these experiments are described in the fast forward box transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor sry is one of about protein coding genes on the y chromosome the two ends of the y chromosome are called the pseudoautosomal regions pars because homologous dna sequences are present at the ends of the x chromosome fig the two pars par and par together contain about genes copies of which are found on both the x and y chromosomes most of the y chromosome however is called the male specific region msy fig the functions of only some of the genes in the msy are understood the msy includes four y specific and therefore male specific genes sry and three genes required for spermatogenesis the name msy is somewhat misleading because eight of the genes in the msy also exist on the x chromosome but unlike the par genes they are not grouped together in one region of either the x or y these eight msy genes affect the functions of cells and tissues all over the body in fact several of these msy genes shared with x are essential for male viability because without the y linked copies the single gene copies on the x chromosome do not supply sufficient protein females normally express both alleles of the x linked copies of these eight genes as these genes escape a phenomenon described later in this chapter figure sex reversal sex reversed xx males have a part of the y including the sry gene on one of their x chromosomes sexreversed xy females lack sry on their y chromosome either because it has been replaced by part of the x chromosome or because it has been inactivated by mutation figure human sex chromosomes have both shared and unique genes par and par black are homologous regions of the x and y chromosomes that together contain about genes the msy region contains genes needed for maleness itself sry genes for male fertility and essential genes shared with the x required for male viability because their x linked counterparts alone do not produce enough protein includes sry male fertility genes essential genes shared with x msy region y par par par transgenic mice prove that sry is the maleness factor genes similar to human sry have been identified on the y chromosomes of nearly all mammalian species in researchers used mouse transgenic technology to show definitively that the sry gene is the crucial determinant of maleness a transgenic mouse is one whose genome contains copies of a gene that came from another individual or even from another species such genes are called transgenes one focus of genetic engineering is technology for the manipulation and insertion of transgenes to determine if sry is sufficient to determine maleness researchers wanted to introduce copies of the mouse sry gene into the genome of chromosomally female xx mice if sry is the crucial determinant of maleness then xx mice containing an sry transgene would nevertheless be male first the scientists isolated the dna of the mouse sry gene using cloning technology to be discussed in later chapters next using a method called pronuclear injection transgenic mice were generated that contained the sry gene on one of their autosomes to perform pronuclear injection researchers collected many fertilized mouse eggs from mated females and injected the sperm or egg nucleus called a pronucleus when in the zygote with hundreds of copies of the sry gene dna fig a enzymes in the pronucleus integrated the dna into random locations in the genome fig a after the injected zygotes matured into early embryos they were implanted into surrogate mothers when the mice were born cells were taken from their tails and tested for the presence of the sry transgene using molecular biology techniques figure b shows at the right a transgenic mouse transformed with sry obtained in this study although it is chromosomally xx it is phenotypically male this result demonstrates conclusively that the sry gene alone is sufficient to determine maleness figure a using pronuclear injection to generate mice transgenic for the sry gene brigid hogan howard hughes medical institute vanderbilt university charles river laboratories figure b an xx mouse transformed with sry is phenotypically male both the transformed xx mouse at the right and its normal xy littermate at the left have normal male genitalia arrows point to the penis medical research council science source the x chromosome contains about genes most of which have nothing to do with sex they specify proteins needed by both males and females why does having an sry gene mean that you will be male and not having sry mean that you will be female approximately six weeks after fertilization sry protein activates testes development in xy or sex reversed xx embryos the embryonic testes secrete hormones that trigger the development of male sex organs and prevent the formation of female sex organs in the absence of sry protein an ovary develops instead of a testis and other female sex organs develop by default tail cells tested for presence of sry transgene

in fruit flies for example although normal females are xx and normal males xy see fig it is ultimately the number of x chromosomes and not the presence or absence of the y that determines sex the different responses of humans and drosophila to the same unusual complements of sex chromosomes table reveal that the mechanisms for sex determination differ in flies and humans xxy flies are female because they have two x chromosomes but xxy humans are male because they have a y conversely because they have one x chromosome xo flies are male while xo humans are female because they lack a y the xx female xy male strategy of sex determination is by no means universal in some species of moths for example the females are xx but the males are xo in c elegans one species of nematode males are similarly xo but xx individuals are not females they are instead selffertilizing hermaphrodites that produce both eggs and sperm in birds and butterflies males have the matching sex chromosomes while females have an unmatched set in such species geneticists represent the sex chromosomes as zz in the male and zw in the female the sex having two different sex chromosomes is termed the heterogametic sex because it gives rise to two different types of gametes conversely the sex with two similar sex chromosomes is the homogametic sex the gametes of the heterogametic sex would contain either x or y in the case of male humans and either z or w in the case of female birds the gametes of the homogametic sex would contain only an x humans or only a z birds yet other variations include the complicated sex determination mechanisms of bees and wasps in which females are diploid and males haploid and the systems of certain fish in which sex is determined by changes in the environment such as fluctuations in temperature table summarizes some of the astonishing variety in the ways that different species have solved the problem of assigning sex to individuals in spite of these many differences between species early researchers concluded that chromosomes can carry the genetic information specifying sexual characteristics and probably many other traits as well sutton and other early adherents of the chromosome theory realized that the perpetuation of life itself therefore depends on the proper distribution of chromosomes during cell division in the next sections you will see that the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis is exactly that expected of cellular structures carrying genes many sexually reproducing organisms have sex chromosomes that are sex specific and that determine sex in humans male sex determination is triggered by a y linked gene called sry female sex determination occurs in xx embryos by default mechanisms of sex determination vary remarkably in some species sex is determined by environmental factors rather than by specific chromosomes mitosis cell division that preserves chromosome number learning objectives describe the key chromosome behaviors during mitosis diagram the forces and structures that dictate chromosomal movement during mitosis the fertilized human egg is a single diploid cell that preserves its genetic identity unchanged through more than generations of cells as it divides again and again to produce a full term infant ready to be born as the newborn infant develops into a toddler a teenager and an adult yet more cell divisions fuel continued growth and maturation mitosis the nuclear division that apportions chromosomes in equal fashion to two daughter cells is the cellular mechanism that preserves genetic information through all these generations of cells in this section we take a close look at how the nuclear division of mitosis fits into the overall scheme of cell growth and division if you were to peer through a microscope and follow the history of one cell through time you would see that for much of your observation the chromosomes resemble a mass of extremely fine tangled string called chromatin surrounded by the nuclear envelope each convoluted thread of chromatin is composed mainly of dna which carries the genetic information and protein which serves as a scaffold for packaging and managing that information as described in chapter you would also be able to distinguish one or two darker areas of chromatin called nucleoli singular nucleolus literally small nucleus nucleoli play a key role in the manufacture of ribosomes organelles that function in protein synthesis during the period between cell divisions the chromatin laden nucleus houses a great deal of invisible activity necessary for the growth and survival of the cell one particularly important part of this activity is the accurate duplication of all the chromosomal material with continued vigilance you would observe a dramatic change in the nuclear landscape during one very short period in the cells life history the chromatin condenses into discrete threads and then each chromosome compacts even further into the twin rods clamped together at their centromeres that can be identified in karyotype analysis review fig each rod in a duo is called a chromatid as described earlier it is an exact duplicate of the other sister chromatid to which it is connected continued observation would reveal the doubled chromosomes beginning to jostle around inside the cell eventually lining up at the cells midplane at this point the sister chromatids of each chromosome separate to opposite poles of the now elongating cell where they become identical sets of chromosomes each of the two identical sets eventually ends up enclosed in a separate nucleus in a separate cell the two cells known as daughter cells are thus genetically identical the repeating pattern of cell growth an increase in size followed by division the splitting of one cell into two is called the cell cycle fig only a small part of the cell cycle is spent in division or m phase the period between divisions is called interphase during interphase cells grow and replicate their chromosomes interphase consists of three parts gap g synthesis s and gap g fig g lasts from the birth of a new cell to the onset of chromosome replication for the genetic material it is a period when the chromosomes are neither duplicating nor dividing during this time the cell achieves most of its growth by using the information from its genes to make and assemble the materials it needs to function normally g varies in length more than any other phase of the cell cycle in rapidly dividing cells of the human embryo for example g is as short as a few hours in contrast mature brain cells become arrested in a resting form of g known as g and do not normally divide again during a persons lifetime synthesis s is the time when the cell duplicates its genetic material by synthesizing dna during duplication each chromosome doubles to produce identical sister chromatids that will become visible when the chromosomes condense at the beginning of mitosis the two sister chromatids remain joined to each other at their centromeres note that this joined structure is considered a single chromosome as long as the connection between sister chromatids is maintained the replication of chromosomes during s phase is crucial the genetic material must be copied exactly so that both daughter cells receive identical sets of chromosomes gap g is the interval between chromosome duplication and the beginning of mitosis during this time the cell may grow usually less than during g it also synthesizes proteins that are essential to the subsequent steps of mitosis itself in addition during interphase an array of fine microtubules crucial for many biochemical processes becomes visible outside the nucleus the microtubules radiate out into the cytoplasm from a single organizing center known as the centrosome usually located near the nuclear envelope in animal cells the discernible core of each centrosome is a pair of small darkly staining bodies called centrioles fig a the microtubule organizing center of plants does not contain centrioles during the s and g stages of interphase the centrosomes replicate producing two centrosomes that remain in extremely close proximity figure the cell cycle an alternation between interphase and mitosis a chromosomes replicate to form sister chromatids during synthesis s phase the sister chromatids segregate to daughter cells during mitosis m phase the gaps between the s and m phases during which most cell growth takes place are called the g and g phases in multicellular organisms some terminally differentiated cells stop dividing and arrest in a g stage b interphase consists of the g s and g phases together during mitosis sister chromatids separate and two daughter nuclei form although the rigorously choreographed events of nuclear and cellular division occur as a dynamic and continuous process scientists traditionally analyze the process in separate stages marked by visible cytological events the artists sketches in fig illustrate these stages in the nematode ascaris whose diploid cells contain only four chromosomes two pairs of homologous chromosomes prophase chromosomes condense fig a during all of interphase the cell nucleus remains intact and the chromosomes are indistinguishable aggregates of chromatin at prophase from the greek pro meaning before the gradual emergence or condensation of individual chromosomes from the undifferentiated mass of chromatin marks the beginning of mitosis each condensing chromosome has already been duplicated during interphase and thus consists of sister chromatids attached at their centromeres at this stage in ascaris cells therefore four chromosomes exist with a total of eight chromatids the progressive appearance of an array of individual chromosomes is a truly impressive event interphase dna molecules as long as cm condense into discrete chromosomes whose length is measured in microns millionths of a meter this process is equivalent to compacting a m length of thin string as long as two football fields into a cylinder mm long and mm wide another visible change in chromatin also takes place during prophase the darkly staining nucleoli begin to break down and disappear as a result the manufacture of ribosomes ceases providing one indication that general cellular metabolism shuts down so that the cell can focus its energy on chromosome movements and cellular division several important events that characterize prophase occur outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm the centrosomes which replicated during interphase now move apart and become clearly distinguishable as two separate entities in the light microscope at the same time the interphase scaffolding of long stable microtubules disappears and is replaced by a set of dynamic microtubules that rapidly grow from and shrink back toward their centrosomal organizing centers the centrosomes continue to move apart migrating around the nuclear envelope toward opposite ends of the nucleus apparently propelled by forces exerted between interdigitated microtubules extending from the two centrosomes prometaphase the spindle forms fig b prometaphase before middle stage begins with the breakdown of the nuclear envelope which allows microtubules extending from the two centrosomes to invade the nucleus chromosomes attach to these microtubules through the kinetochore a structure in the centromere region of each chromatid that is specialized for conveyance each kinetochore contains proteins that act as molecular motors enabling the chromosome to slide along the microtubule when the kinetochore of a chromatid originally contacts a microtubule at prometaphase the kinetochore based motor moves the entire chromosome toward the centrosome from which that microtubule radiates microtubules growing from the two centrosomes capture chromosomes by connecting first to the kinetochore of one of the two sister chromatids chosen at random as a result it is sometimes possible to observe groups of chromosomes congregating in the vicinity of each centrosome in this early part of prometaphase for each chromosome one chromatids kinetochore is attached to a microtubule but the sister chromatids kinetochore remains unattached during prometaphase three different types of microtubule fibers together form the mitotic spindle all of these microtubule classes originate from the centrosomes which function as the two poles of the spindle apparatus microtubules that extend between a centrosome and the kinetochore of a chromatid are called kinetochore microtubules or centromeric fibers microtubules from each centrosome that are directed toward the middle of the cell are polar microtubules polar microtubules originating in opposite centrosomes interdigitate near the cells equator finally short astral microtubules extend out from the centrosome toward the cells periphery soon before the end of prometaphase the kinetochore of each chromosomes previously unattached sister chromatid now associates with microtubules extending from the opposite centrosome this event orients each chromosome such that one sister chromatid faces one pole of the cell and the other faces the opposite pole experimental manipulation has shown that if both kinetochores become attached to microtubules from the same pole the configuration is unstable one of the kinetochores will detach repeatedly from the spindle until it associates with microtubules from the other pole the attachment of sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles is the only stable arrangement metaphase chromosomes align at the cells equator fig c during metaphase middle stage the connection of sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles sets in motion a series of jostling movements that cause the chromosomes to move toward an imaginary equator halfway between the two poles the imaginary midline is called the metaphase plate when the chromosomes are aligned along it the forces pulling sister chromatids toward opposite poles are in a balanced equilibrium maintained by tension across the chromosomes tension results from the fact that the sister chromatids are pulled in opposite directions while they are still connected to each other by the tight cohesion of their centromeres tension compensates for any chance movement away from the metaphase plate by restoring the chromosome to its position equidistant between the poles anaphase sister chromatids move to opposite spindle poles fig d the nearly simultaneous severing of the centromeric connections between the sister chromatids of all chromosomes indicates that anaphase from the greek ana meaning up as in up toward the poles is underway the separation of sister chromatids allows each chromatid to be pulled toward the spindle pole to which it is linked by kinetochore microtubules as the chromatid moves toward the pole its kinetochore microtubules shorten because the arms of the chromatids lag behind the kinetochores metacentric chromatids have a characteristic v shape during anaphase the attachment of sister chromatids to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles means that the genetic information migrating toward one pole is exactly the same as its counterpart moving toward the opposite pole telophase identical sets of chromosomes are enclosed in two nuclei fig e the final transformation of chromosomes and the nucleus during mitosis happens at telophase from the greek telomeaning end telophase is like a rewind of prophase the spindle fibers begin to disperse a nuclear envelope forms around the group of chromatids at each pole and one or more nucleoli reappear the former chromatids now function as independent chromosomes which decondense uncoil and dissolve into a tangled mass of chromatin mitosis the division of one nucleus into two identical nuclei is over cytokinesis the cytoplasm divides fig f in the final stage of cell division the daughter nuclei emerging at the end of telophase are packaged into two separate daughter cells this final stage of division is called cytokinesis literally cell movement during cytokinesis the elongated parent cell separates into two smaller independent daughter cells with identical nuclei cytokinesis usually begins during anaphase but it is not completed until after telophase the mechanism by which cells accomplish cytokinesis differs in animals and plants in animal cells cytoplasmic division depends on a contractile ring that pinches the cell into two approximately equal halves similar to the way the pulling of a string closes the opening of a bag of marbles fig a intriguingly some types of molecules that form the contractile ring also participate in the mechanism responsible for muscle contraction in plants whose cells are surrounded by a rigid cell wall a membrane enclosed disk known as the cell plate forms inside the cell near the equator and then grows rapidly outward thereby dividing the cell in two fig b during cytokinesis a large number of important organelles and other cellular components including ribosomes mitochondria membranous structures such as golgi bodies and in plants chloroplasts must be parceled out to the emerging daughter cells the mechanism accomplishing this task does not appear to predetermine which organelle is destined for which daughter cell instead because most cells contain many copies of these cytoplasmic structures each new cell is bound to receive at least a few representatives of each component this original complement of structures is enough to sustain the cell until synthetic activity can repopulate the cytoplasm with organelles sometimes cytoplasmic division does not immediately follow nuclear division and the result is a cell containing more than one nucleus an animal cell with two or more nuclei is known as a syncytium the early embryos of fruit flies are multinucleated syncytia fig as are the precursors of spermatozoa in humans and many other animals a multinucleate plant tissue is called a coenocyte coconut milk is a nutrient rich food composed of coenocytes mitosis maintains the chromosome number of the parent cell in the two daughter nuclei in the photomicrographs of newt lung cells at the left chromosomes are stained blue

red wedges ensure that important events in the cell cycle occur in the proper sequence at each checkpoint the cell determines whether prior events have been completed before it can proceed to the next step of the cell cycle for simplicity we show only two chromosomes per cell metaphase anaphase telophase and cytokinesis interphase ongoing protein synthesis and cell growth have all chromosomes arrived and aligned at the metaphase plate then initiate anaphase have the chromosomes been completely duplicated then enter mitosis is cell of su cient size have proper signals been received then duplicate chromosomes and centrosomes chromosome and centrosome duplication regulatory checkpoints ensure correct chromosome separation the cell cycle is a complex sequence of precisely coordinated events in higher organisms a cells decision to divide depends on both intrinsic factors such as conditions within the cell that register a sufficient size for division and signals from the environment such as hormonal cues or contacts with neighboring cells that encourage or restrain division once a cell has initiated events leading to division usually during the g period of interphase everything else follows like clockwork a number of checkpoints moments at which the cell evaluates the results of previous steps allow the sequential coordination of cell cycle events fig for example the enzymes operating in one type of checkpoint monitor dna replication to ensure that cells do not begin mitosis until all the chromosomes have been completely copied if this checkpoint did not exist at least one of the daughter cells would lose dna every cell cycle in a second illustration of the molecular basis of checkpoints even a single kinetochore that has not attached to spindle fibers generates a molecular signal that prevents the sister chromatids of all chromosomes from separating at their centromeres this signal makes the beginning of anaphase dependent on the prior proper alignment of all the chromosomes at metaphase as a result of this cell cycle checkpoint each daughter cell reliably receives the right number of chromosomes breakdown of the mitotic machinery can produce division mistakes that have crucial consequences for the cell improper chromosome segregation for example can cause serious malfunction or even the death of daughter cells gene mutations that disrupt mitotic structures such as the spindle kinetochores or centrosomes are one source of improper segregation other problems occur in cells where the normal restraints on cell division such as checkpoints have broken down such cells may divide uncontrollably leading to a tumor we present the details of cell cycle regulation checkpoint controls and cancer formation in chapter through mitosis diploid cells produce identical diploid progeny cells at metaphase the sister chromatids are being pulled at their kinetochores toward opposite spindle poles these poleward forces are balanced because the chromatids are connected at their centromeres at the beginning of anaphase the connections between sister centromeres are severed so sister chromatids separate and move to opposite spindle poles cell cycle checkpoints help ensure correct duplication and separation of chromosomes meiosis cell divisions that halve chromosome number learning objectives describe the key chromosome behaviors during meiosis that lead to haploid gametes compare chromosome behaviors during mitosis and meiosis explain how the independent alignment of homologs and also crossing over during the first meiotic division each contribute to the genetic diversity of gametes during the many rounds of cell division within an embryo most cells either grow and divide via the mitotic cell cycle just described or they stop growing and become arrested in g these mitotically dividing and g arrested cells are the so called somatic cells whose descendants continue to make up the vast majority of each organisms tissues throughout the lifetime of the individual early in the embryonic development of animals however a group of cells is set aside for a different fate these are the germ cells cells destined for a specialized role in the production of gametes germ cells arise later in plants during floral development instead of during embryogenesis the germ cells become incorporated in the reproductive organs ovaries and testes in animals ovaries and anthers in flowering plants where they ultimately undergo meiosis the special two part cell division that produces gametes eggs and sperm containing half the number of chromosomes other body cells have figure an overview of meiosis the chromosomes replicate once while the nuclei divide twice in this figure all four chromatids of each chromosome pair are shown in the same shade of the same color note that the chromosomes duplicate before meiosis i but they do not duplicate between meiosis i and meiosis ii chromosomes duplicate meiosis meiosis no duplication no duplication the union of haploid gametes at fertilization yields diploid offspring that carry the combined genetic heritage of two parents sexual reproduction therefore requires the alternation of haploid and diploid generations of cells if gametes were diploid rather than haploid the number of chromosomes would double in each successive generation in humans for example the children would have chromosomes per cell the grandchildren and so on meiosis prevents this lethal exponential accumulation of chromosomes in meiosis the chromosomes replicate once but the nucleus divides twice unlike mitosis meiosis consists of two successive nuclear divisions logically named division i of meiosis and division ii of meiosis or simply meiosis i and meiosis ii with each round the cell passes through a prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase in meiosis i the parent nucleus divides to form two daughter nuclei in meiosis ii each of the two daughter nuclei divides resulting in four nuclei fig these four nuclei the final products of meiosis become partitioned in four separate daughter cells because cytokinesis occurs after both rounds of division the chromosomes duplicate at the start of meiosis i but they do not duplicate in meiosis ii which explains why the gametes contain half the number of chromosomes found in somatic cells a close look at each round of meiotic division reveals the mechanisms by which each gamete comes to receive one full haploid set of chromosomes during meiosis i homologs pair exchange parts and then segregate the events of meiosis i are unique among nuclear divisions fig meiosis i the process begins with the replication meiosis one diploid cell produces four haploid cells prophase i leptotene chromosomes thicken and become visible but the chromatids remain invisible centrosomes begin to move toward opposite poles anaphase i sister centromeres remain connected to each other the chiasmata dissolve homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles metaphase i tetrads line up along the metaphase plate each chromosome of a homologous pair attaches to fibers from opposite poles sister chromatids attach to fibers from the same pole prophase i zygotene homologous chromosomes enter synapsis the synaptonemal complex forms prophase i pachytene synapsis is complete crossing over genetic exchange between nonsister chromatids of a homologous pair occurs meiosis i a reductional division to aid visualization of the chromosomes the figure is simplified in two ways the nuclear envelope is not shown during prophase of either meiotic division the chromosomes are shown as fully condensed at zygotene in reality full condensation is not achieved until diakinesis prophase i diplotene synaptonemal complex dissolves a tetrad of four chromatids is visible crossover points appear as chiasmata holding nonsister chromatids together meiotic arrest occurs at this time in many species prophase i diakinesis chromatids thicken and shorten at the end of prophase i the nuclear membrane not shown earlier breaks down and the spindle begins to form telophase i the nuclear envelope re forms resultant cells have half the number of chromosomes each consisting of two sister chromatids cytokinesis separates the daughter cells not shown interkinesis this is similar to interphase with one important exception no chromosomal duplication takes place in some species the chromosomes decondense in others they do not telophase ii chromosomes begin to uncoil nuclear envelopes and nucleoli not shown re form cytokinesis the cytoplasm divides forming four new haploid cells metaphase i tetrads line up along the metaphase plate each chromosome of a homologous pair attaches to fibers from opposite poles sister chromatids attach to fibers from the same pole prophase i zygotene homologous chromosomes enter synapsis the synaptonemal complex forms prophase i pachytene synapsis is complete crossing over genetic exchange between nonsister chromatids of a homologous pair occurs meiosis i a reductional division metaphase ii chromosomes align at the metaphase plate sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles prophase ii chromosomes condense centrioles move toward the poles the nuclear envelope breaks down at the end of prophase ii not shown meiosis ii an equational division anaphase ii sister centromeres detach from each other allowing sister chromatids to move to opposite poles of chromosomes after which each one consists of two sister chromatids a key to understanding meiosis i is the observation that the centromeres of these sister chromatids remain connected throughout the entire division rather than separating from each other as in mitosis as meiosis i proceeds homologous chromosomes align across the cellular equator to form a coupling that ensures proper chromosome segregation later in the division moreover during the time homologous chromosomes face each other across the equator the maternal and paternal chromosomes of each homologous pair may exchange parts creating new combinations of alleles at different genes along the chromosomes afterward the two homologous chromosomes each still consisting of two sister chromatids connected at their centromeres are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle as a result it is homologous chromosomes rather than sister chromatids as in mitosis that segregate into different daughter cells at the conclusion of the first meiotic division with this overview in mind let us take a closer look at the specific events of meiosis i remembering that we analyze a dynamic flowing sequence of cellular events by breaking it down somewhat arbitrarily into the easily pictured traditional phases prophase i homologs condense and pair and crossing over occurs among the crucial events of prophase i are the condensation of chromatin the pairing of homologous chromosomes and the reciprocal exchange of genetic information between these paired homologs figure shows a generalized view of prophase i however research suggests that the exact sequence of events may vary in different species these complicated processes can take many days months or even years to complete for example in the female germ cells of several species including humans meiosis is suspended at prophase i for many years until ovulation as will be discussed further in section leptotene from the greek for thin and delicate is the first definable substage of prophase i the time when the long thin chromosomes begin to thicken see fig a for a more detailed view each chromosome has already duplicated prior to prophase i as in mitosis and thus consists of two sister chromatids affixed at their centromeres at this point however these sister chromatids are so tightly bound together that they are not yet visible as separate entities zygotene from the greek for conjugation begins as each chromosome seeks out its homologous partner and the matching chromosomes become zipped together in a prophase i of meiosis at very high magnification a leptotene threadlike chromosomes begin to condense and thicken becoming visible as discrete structures although the chromosomes have duplicated the sister chromatids of each chromosome are not yet visible in the microscope b zygotene chromosomes are clearly visible and begin pairing with homologous chromosomes along the synaptonemal complex to form a bivalent or tetrad c pachytene full synapsis of homologs recombination nodules appear along the synaptonemal complex d diplotene bivalent pulls apart slightly but homologous chromosomes remain connected due to recombination at crossover sites chiasmata e diakinesis further condensation of the bivalent homologous chromosomes synaptonemal complex synaptonemal complex recombination nodules sister chromatid sister chromatid sister chromatid sister chromatid diplotene bivalent pulls apart slightly but homologous chromosomes remain connected due to recombination at crossover sites chiasmata e diakinesis further condensation of the bivalent process known as synapsis the zipper itself is an elaborate protein structure called the synaptonemal complex that aligns the homologs with remarkable precision juxtaposing the corresponding genetic regions of the chromosome pair fig b pachytene from the greek for thick or fat begins at the completion of synapsis when homologous chromosomes are united along their length each synapsed chromosome pair is known as a bivalent because it encompasses two chromosomes or a tetrad because it contains four chromatids on one side of the bivalent is a maternally derived chromosome on the other side a paternally derived one because x and y chromosomes are not identical they do not synapse completely however the pseudoautosomal regions previously shown in fig provide small stretches of similarity between the x and the y chromosomes that allow them to pair with each other during meiosis i in males during pachytene structures called recombination nodules begin to appear along the synaptonemal complex and an exchange of parts between nonsister that is between maternal and paternal chromatids occurs at these nodules see fig c for details such an exchange is known as crossing over it results in the recombination of genetic material as a result of crossing over chromatids may no longer be of purely maternal or paternal origin however no genetic information is gained or lost so all chromatids retain their original size diplotene from the greek for twofold or double is signaled by the gradual dissolution of the synaptonemal zipper complex and a slight separation of regions of the homologous chromosomes see fig d the aligned homologous chromosomes of each bivalent nonetheless remain very tightly merged at intervals along their length called chiasmata singular chiasma which represent the sites where crossing over occurred diakinesis from the greek for double movement is accompanied by further condensation of the chromatids because of this chromatid thickening and shortening it can now clearly be seen that each tetrad consists of four separate chromatids or viewed in another way that the two homologous chromosomes of a bivalent are each composed of two sister chromatids held together at their centromeres see fig e nonsister chromatids that have undergone crossing over remain closely associated at chiasmata the end of diakinesis is analogous to the prometaphase of mitosis the nuclear envelope breaks down and the microtubules of the spindle apparatus begin to form metaphase i paired homologs attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during mitosis each sister chromatid has a kinetochore that becomes attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles during meiosis i the situation is different the kinetochores of sister chromatids fuse so that each chromosome contains only a single functional kinetochore during metaphase i see fig meiosis i it is the kinetochores of homologous chromosomes that attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles as a result in chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate the kinetochores of maternally and paternally derived chromosomes are subject to pulling forces from opposite spindle poles balanced by the physical connections between homologs at chiasmata each bivalents alignment and hookup is independent of that of every other bivalent so the chromosomes facing each pole are a random mix of maternal and paternal origin anaphase i homologs move to opposite spindle poles at the onset of anaphase i the chiasmata joining homologous chromosomes dissolve which allows the maternal and paternal homologs to begin to move toward opposite spindle poles see fig meiosis i note that in anaphase of the first meiotic division the sister centromeres do not separate as they do in mitosis thus from each homologous pair one chromosome consisting of two sister chromatids joined at their centromeres segregates to each spindle pole recombination through crossing over plays an important role in the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division the chiasmata hold the homologs together and thus ensure that their kinetochores remain attached to opposite spindle poles throughout metaphase when recombination does not occur within a bivalent mistakes in hookup and conveyance may cause homologous chromosomes to move to the same pole instead of segregating to opposite poles in some organisms however proper segregation of nonrecombinant chromosomes nonetheless occurs through other pairing mechanisms investigators do not yet completely understand the nature of these processes and they are currently evaluating several models to explain them telophase i nuclear envelopes re form the telophase of the first meiotic division or telophase i takes place when nuclear membranes begin to form around the chromosomes that have moved to the poles each of the incipient daughter nuclei contains one half the number of chromosomes in the original parent nucleus but each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at their centromeres see fig meiosis i because the number of chromosomes is reduced to one half the normal diploid number meiosis i is often called a reductional division in most species cytokinesis follows telophase i with daughter nuclei becoming enclosed in separate daughter cells a short interphase then ensues during this time the chromosomes usually decondense in which case they must recondense during the prophase of the subsequent second meiotic division in some species however the chromosomes simply stay condensed most importantly no s phase exists during the interphase between meiosis i and meiosis ii that is the chromosomes do not replicate during meiotic interphase the relatively brief interphase between meiosis i and meiosis ii is known as interkinesis during meiosis ii sister chromatids separate to produce haploid gametes the second meiotic division meiosis ii proceeds in a fashion very similar to that of mitosis but because the number of chromosomes in each dividing nucleus has already been reduced by half the resulting daughter cells are haploid the same process occurs in each of the two daughter cells generated by meiosis i producing four haploid cells at the end of this second meiotic round see fig meiosis ii prophase ii the chromosomes condense if the chromosomes decondensed during the preceding interphase they recondense during prophase ii at the end of prophase ii the nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle apparatus re forms metaphase ii chromosomes align at the metaphase plate the kinetochores of sister chromatids attach to microtubule fibers emanating from opposite poles of the spindle apparatus just as in mitotic metaphase nonetheless two significant features of metaphase ii distinguish it from mitosis first the number of chromosomes is one half that in mitotic metaphase of the same species second in most chromosomes the two sister chromatids are no longer strictly identical because of the recombination through crossing over that occurred during meiosis i the sister chromatids still contain the same genes but they may carry different combinations of alleles anaphase ii sister chromatids move to opposite spindle poles just as in mitosis severing of the connection between sister centromeres allows the sister chromatids to move toward opposite spindle poles during anaphase ii telophase ii nuclear membranes re form and cytokinesis follows membranes form around each of four daughter nuclei in telophase ii and cytokinesis places each nucleus in a separate cell the result is four haploid gametes note that at the end of meiosis ii each daughter cell that is each gamete has the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell present at the beginning of this division for this reason meiosis ii is termed an equational division mistakes in meiosis produce defective gametes segregational errors during either meiotic division can lead to aberrations such as trisomies in the next generation if for example the homologs of a chromosome pair do not segregate during meiosis i a mistake known as nondisjunction they may travel together to the same pole and eventually become part of the same gamete such an error may at fertilization result in any one of a large variety of possible trisomies most autosomal trisomies in humans as we already mentioned are lethal in utero one exception is trisomy the genetic basis of down syndrome like trisomy extra sex chromosomes may also be viable but cause a variety of mental and physical abnormalities such as those seen in klinefelter syndrome see table meiosis contributes to genetic diversity the wider the assortment of different gene combinations among members of a species the greater the chance that at least some individuals will carry combinations of alleles that allow survival in a changing environment two aspects of meiosis contribute to genetic diversity in a population first because only chance governs which paternal or maternal homologs migrate to the two poles during the first meiotic division different gametes carry a different mix of maternal and paternal chromosomes figure a shows how different patterns of homolog migration produce different mixes of parental chromosomes in the gametes the amount of potential variation generated by this random independent assortment increases with the number of chromosomes in ascaris for example where n the chromosome complement shown in fig a the random assortment of homologs could produce only or four types of gametes in a human being however where n this mechanism alone could generate or more than million genetically different kinds of gametes a second feature of meiosis the reshuffling of genetic information through crossing over during prophase i ensures an even greater amount of genetic diversity in gametes because crossing over recombines maternally and paternally derived genes each chromosome in each different gamete could consist of different combinations of maternal and paternal alleles fig b of course sexual reproduction adds yet another means of producing genetic diversity at fertilization any one of a vast number of genetically diverse sperm can fertilize an egg with its own distinctive genetic constitution it is thus not very surprising that with the exception of identical twins the billion people in the world are each genetically unique figure how meiosis contributes to genetic diversity a the variation resulting from the independent assortment of nonhomologous chromosomes increases with the number of chromosomes in the genome b crossing over between homologous chromosomes ensures that each gamete is unique metaphase ii metaphase i metaphase i metaphase ii telophase i telophase ii gametes prophase i meiosis ii meiosis i orientation i orientation ii a independent assortment b recombination mitosis and meiosis a comparison mitosis occurs in all types of eukaryotic cells that is cells with a membrane bounded nucleus and is a conservative mechanism that preserves the genetic status quo mitosis followed by cytokinesis produces growth by increasing the number of cells it also promotes the continual replacement of roots stems and leaves in plants and the regeneration of blood cells intestinal tissues and skin in animals meiosis on the other hand occurs only in sexually reproducing organisms in just a few specialized germ cells within the reproductive organs that produce haploid gametes it is not a conservative mechanism rather the extensive combinatorial changes arising from meiosis are one source of the genetic variation that fuels evolution table illustrates the significant contrasts between the two mechanisms of cell division in meiosis chromosomes replicate once before meiosis i but the nucleus divides twice meiosis i and ii during metaphase i homologous chromosomes connect to opposite spindle poles the independent alignment of each pair of homologs ensures the independent assortment of genes carried on different chromosomes crossing over during the first meiotic division maintains the connection between homologous chromosomes until anaphase i and contributes to the genetic diversity of gametes sister chromatids separate from each other during meiosis ii so that gametes have only one copy of each chromosome fertilization the union of egg and sperm restores the diploid number of chromosomes n to the zygote errors during meiosis may produce gametes with missing or extra chromosomes which often is lethal to offspring gametogenesis learning objectives compare the processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis in humans distinguish between the sex chromosome complements of human female and male germ line cells at different stages of gametogenesis in all sexually reproducing animals the embryonic germ cells collectively known as the germ line undergo a series of mitotic divisions that yield a collection of specialized diploid cells which subsequently divide by meiosis to produce haploid cells as with other biological processes many variations on this general pattern have been observed in some species the haploid cells resulting from meiosis are the gametes themselves while in other species those cells must undergo a specific plan of differentiation to fulfill that function moreover in certain organisms the four haploid products of a single meiosis do not all become gametes gamete formation or gametogenesis thus gives rise to haploid gametes marked not only by the events of meiosis per se but also by cellular events that precede and follow meiosis here we illustrate gametogenesis with a description of egg and sperm formation in humans the details of gamete formation in several other organisms appear throughout the book in discussions of specific experimental studies haploid and diploid cells can undergo mitosis one round of division mitosis is preceded by s phase chromosome duplication chromosomes duplicate prior to meiosis i but not before meiosis ii occurs in germ cells as part of the sexual cycle two rounds of division meiosis i and meiosis ii only diploid cells undergo meiosis interkinesis gamete formation g s g meiosis ii n n n n n n n n mitosis meiosis i meiosis ii mitosis produces two new daughter cells identical to each other and the original cell mitosis is thus genetically conservative meiosis produces four haploid cells one egg or all sperm of which can become gametes none of these is identical to each other or to the original cell because meiosis results in combinatorial change during prophase of meiosis i homologous chromosomes pair synapse along their length crossing over occurs between homologous chromosomes during prophase of meiosis i homologous chromosomes not sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during metaphase i the centromeres of the sister chromatids remain tightly attached during meiosis i sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during metaphase ii the centromeres of the sister chromatids separate at the beginning of anaphase ii homologous chromosomes do not pair genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes is very rare sister chromatids attach to spindle fibers from opposite poles during metaphase the centromeres of the sister chromatids separate at the beginning of anaphase figure in humans egg formation begins in the fetal ovaries and arrests during the prophase of meiosis i fetal ovaries contain about primary oocytes arrested in the diplotene substage of meiosis i if the egg released during a menstrual cycle is fertilized meiosis is completed only one of the three cells produced by meiosis serves as the functional gamete or ovum arrest at diplotene of meiosis i oocyte grows and accumulates nutrients mitosis occurs in fetal ovary meiosis i asymmetrical division completed at ovulation meiosis ii asymmetrical division completed only after fertilization oogonia arrested primary oocyte secondary oocyte first polar body second polar body mature ovum ovarian ligament primary oocyte within primary follicle developing follicle with primary oocyte mature follicle with secondary oocyte ruptured follicle released secondary oocyte oogenesis in humans produces one ovum from each primary oocyte the end product of egg formation in humans is a large nutrient rich ovum whose stored resources can sustain the early embryo the process known as oogenesis fig begins when diploid germ cells in the ovary called oogonia singular oogonium multiply rapidly by mitosis and produce a large number of primary oocytes which then undergo meiosis for each primary oocyte meiosis i results in the formation of two daughter cells that differ in size so this division is asymmetric the larger of these cells the secondary oocyte receives over of the cytoplasm the other small sister cell is known as the first polar body during meiosis ii the secondary oocyte undergoes another asymmetrical division to produce a large haploid ovum and a small haploid second polar body the first polar body usually arrests its development the two small polar bodies apparently serve no function and disintegrate leaving one large haploid ovum as the functional gamete thus only one of the three or rarely four products of a single meiosis serves as a female gamete a normal human ovum carries autosomes and an x sex chromosome oogenesis begins in the fetus by six months after conception the fetal ovaries are fully formed and contain about half a million primary oocytes arrested in the diplotene substage of prophase i these cells with their homologous chromosomes locked in synapsis were thought for decades to be the only oocytes the female will produce if so a girl is born with all the oocytes she will ever possess remarkably recent research has brought this long held theory into question scientists have shown that germ line precursor cells removed from adult ovaries can produce new eggs in a petri dish however it is not yet known whether these eggs are viable nor if these germ line cells normally produce eggs in adults from the onset of puberty at about age until menopause some years later most women release one primary oocyte each month from alternate ovaries amounting to roughly oocytes released during the reproductive years the remaining primary oocytes disintegrate during menopause at ovulation a released oocyte completes meiosis i and proceeds as far as the metaphase of meiosis ii if the oocyte is then fertilized that is penetrated by a sperm nucleus it quickly completes meiosis ii the nuclear membranes of the sperm and ovum dissolve allowing their chromosomes to form the single diploid nucleus of the zygote and the zygote divides by mitosis to produce a functional embryo in contrast unfertilized oocytes exit the body during the menses stage of the menstrual cycle the long interval before completion of meiosis in oocytes released by women in their s s and s may contribute to the observed correlation between maternal age and meiotic segregational errors including those that produce trisomies women in their mid s for example run a very small risk of trisomy only of children born to women of this age have down syndrome during the later childbearing years however the risk rises rapidly at age it is of live births and at age it is you would not expect this age related increase in risk if meiosis were completed before the mothers birth spermatogenesis in humans produces four sperm from each primary spermatocyte the production of sperm or spermatogenesis fig begins in the male testes in germ cells known as spermatogonia mitotic divisions of the spermatogonia produce many diploid cells the primary spermatocytes unlike primary oocytes primary spermatocytes undergo a symmetrical meiosis i producing two secondary spermatocytes each of which undergoes a symmetrical meiosis ii at the conclusion of meiosis each original primary spermatocyte thus yields four equivalent haploid spermatids these spermatids then mature by developing a characteristic whiplike tail and by concentrating all their chromosomal material in a head thereby becoming functional sperm a human sperm much smaller than the ovum it will fertilize contains autosomes and either an x or a y sex chromosome the timing of sperm production differs radically from that of egg formation the meiotic divisions allowing conversion of primary spermatocytes to spermatids begin only at puberty but meiosis then continues throughout a mans life the entire process of spermatogenesis takes about days for meiosis i for meiosis ii and for the maturation of spermatids into fully functional sperm within each testis after puberty millions of sperm are always in production and a single ejaculate can contain up to million over a lifetime a man can produce billions of sperm almost equally divided between those bearing an x and those bearing a y chromosome essential concepts diploid germ cell precursors proliferate by mitosis and then undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes human females are born with oocytes arrested in prophase of meiosis i meiosis resumes at ovulation but is not completed until fertilization spermatogenesis begins at puberty and continues through the lifetimes of human males the two meiotic divisions of oogenesis are asymmetrical so a primary oocyte results in a single egg the two meiotic divisions of spermatogenesis are symmetrical so a primary spermatocyte results in four sperm all human oocytes contain a single x chromosome human sperm contain either an x or a y figure human sperm form continuously in the testes after puberty spermatogonia are located near the exterior of seminiferous tubules in a human testis once they divide to produce the primary spermatocytes the subsequent stages of spermatogenesis meiotic divisions in the spermatocytes and maturation of spermatids into sperm occur successively closer to the middle of the tubule mature sperm are released into the central lumen of the tubule for ejaculation spermatogonia spermatogonia primary spermatocyte secondary spermatocyte primary spermatocyte after chromosome duplication secondary spermatocyte sperm spermatid spermatids sperm mitosis occurs in adult testis meiosis i meiosis ii di erentiation validation of the chromosome theory learning objectives describe the key events of meiosis that explain mendels first and second laws infer from the results of crosses whether or not a trait is sex linked predict phenotypes associated with nondisjunction of sex chromosomes we have presented thus far two circumstantial lines of evidence in support of the chromosome theory of inheritance first the phenotype of sexual morphology is associated with the inheritance of particular chromosomes second the events of mitosis meiosis and gametogenesis ensure a constant number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of all members of a species over time one would expect the genetic material to exhibit this kind of stability even in organisms with very different modes of reproduction final acceptance of the chromosome theory depended on researchers going beyond the circumstantial evidence to a rigorous demonstration of two key points that the inheritance of genes corresponds with the inheritance of chromosomes in every detail and that the transmission of particular chromosomes coincides with the transmission of specific traits other than sex determination mendels laws correlate with chromosome behavior during meiosis walter sutton first outlined the chromosome theory of inheritance in building on the theoretical ideas and experimental results of theodor boveri in germany e b wilson in new york and others in a paper sutton speculated that the association of paternal and maternal chromosomes in pairs and their subsequent separation during the reducing division that is meiosis i may constitute the physical basis of the mendelian law of heredity in he suggested that chromosomes carry mendels hereditary units for the following reasons every cell contains two copies of each kind of chromosome and two copies of each kind of gene the chromosome complement like mendels genes appears unchanged as it is transmitted from parents to offspring through generations during meiosis homologous chromosomes pair and then separate to different gametes just as the alternative alleles of each gene segregate to different gametes maternal and paternal copies of each chromosome pair move to opposite spindle poles without regard to the assortment of any other homologous chromosome pair just as the alternative alleles of unrelated genes assort independently at fertilization an eggs set of chromosomes unites with a randomly encountered sperms set of chromosomes just as alleles obtained from one parent unite at random with those from the other parent in all cells derived from the fertilized egg one half of the chromosomes and one half of the genes are of maternal origin the other half of paternal origin the two parts of table show the intimate relationship between the chromosome theory of inheritance and mendels laws of segregation and independent assortment if mendels genes for pea shape and pea color are assigned to different that is nonhomologous chromosomes the behavior of chromosomes can be seen to parallel the behavior of genes walter suttons observation of these parallels led him to propose that chromosomes and genes are physically connected in some manner meiosis ensures that each gamete will contain only a single chromatid of a bivalent and thus only a single allele of any gene on that chromatid table a the independent behavior of two bivalents during meiosis means that the genes carried on different chromosomes will assort into gametes independently table b from a review of fig a which follows two different chromosome pairs through the process of meiosis you might wonder whether crossing over abolishes the clear correspondence between mendels laws and the movement of chromosomes the answer is no each chromatid of a homologous chromosome pair contains only one copy of a given gene and only one chromatid from each pair of homologs is incorporated into each gamete because alternative alleles remain on different chromatids even after crossing over has occurred alternative alleles still segregate to different gametes as demanded by mendels first law furthermore because the orientations of nonhomologous chromosomes are completely random with respect to each other during both meiotic divisions the genes on different chromosomes assort independently even if crossing over occurs as demanded by mendels second law in fig a you can see that without recombination each of the two random alignments of the nonhomologous chromosomes results in the production of only two of the four gamete types ab and ab for one orientation and ab and ab for the other orientation with recombination each of the alignments of alleles in fig a may in fact generate all four gamete types imagine a crossover switching the positions of a and a nonsister chromatids in fig a thus both the random alignment of nonhomologous chromosomes and crossing over contribute to the phenomenon of independent assortment specific traits are transmitted with specific chromosomes the fate of a theory depends on whether its predictions can be validated because genes determine traits the prediction that chromosomes carry genes could be tested by breeding experiments that would show whether transmission of a specific chromosome coincides with transmission of a specific trait cytologists knew that one pair of chromosomes the sex chromosomes determines whether an individual is male or female would similar correlations exist for other traits

homologs will separate to opposite spindle poles during anaphase i at the end of meiosis ii two types of gametes have been produced half have r and half have r but no gametes have both alleles thus the separation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis i corresponds to the segregation of alleles as the punnett square shows fertilization of r and r eggs with the same proportion of r and r sperm leads to mendels ratio in the f generation one pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed shape alleles r and r a second pair of homologous chromosomes carries the gene for seed color alleles y and y each homologous pair aligns at random at the metaphase plate during meiosis i independently of the other homologous pair thus two equally likely configurations are possible for the migration of any two chromosome pairs toward the poles during anaphase i as a result a dihybrid individual will generate four equally likely types of gametes with regard to the two traits in question the punnett square affirms that independent assortment of traits carried by nonhomologous chromosomes produces mendels ratio a gene determining eye color on the drosophila x chromosome thomas hunt morgan an american experimental biologist with training in embryology headed the research group whose findings eventually established a firm experimental base for the chromosome theory morgan chose to work with the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster because it is extremely prolific and has a very short generation time taking only days to develop from a fertilized egg into a mature adult capable of producing hundreds of offspring morgan fed his flies mashed bananas and housed them in empty milk bottles capped with wads of cotton in a white eyed male appeared among a large group of flies with brick red eyes a mutation had apparently altered a gene determining eye color changing it from the normal wild type allele specifying red to a new allele that produced white when morgan allowed the white eyed male to mate with its red eyed sisters all the flies of the f generation had red eyes the red allele was clearly dominant to the white fig cross a establishing a pattern of nomenclature for drosophila geneticists morgan named the gene identified by the abnormal white eye color the white gene for the mutation that revealed its existence the normal wild type allele of the white gene abbreviated w is for brick red eyes while the counterpart mutant w allele results in white eye color the superscript signifies the wild type by writing the gene name and abbreviation in lowercase morgan symbolized that the mutant w allele is recessive to the wild type w if a drosophila mutation results in a dominant non wild type phenotype the first letter of the gene name or of its abbreviation is capitalized thus the mutation known as bar eyes is dominant to the wild type bar allele see the appendix guidelines for gene nomenclature morgan then crossed the red eyed males of the f generation with their red eyed sisters fig cross b and obtained an f generation with the predicted ratio of red to white eyes but there was something askew in the pattern among the red eyed offspring there were two females for every one male and all the white eyed offspring were males this result was surprisingly different from the equal transmission to both sexes of the mendelian traits discussed in chapters and in these fruit flies the ratio of eye colors was not the same in male and female progeny by mating f red eyed females with their white eyed brothers fig cross c morgan obtained some females with white eyes which then allowed him to mate a white eyed female with a red eyed wild type male fig cross d the result was exclusively red eyed daughters and white eyed sons the pattern seen in cross d is known as crisscross inheritance because the males inherit their eye color from their mothers while the daughters inherit their eye color from their fathers note in fig that the results of the reciprocal crosses red female white male cross a and white female red male cross d are not identical again in contrast with mendels findings from the data morgan reasoned that the white gene for eye color is x linked that is carried by the x chromosome note that while symbols for genes and alleles are italicized symbols for chromosomes are not the y chromosome carries no allele of this gene for eye color males therefore have only one copy of the gene which they inherit from their mother along with their only x chromosome their y chromosome must come from their father thus males are hemizygous for this eye color gene because their diploid cells have half the number of alleles carried by the female on her two x chromosomes if the single white gene on the x chromosome of a male is the wild type w allele he will have red eyes and a genotype that can be written xw y here we designate the chromosome x or y together with the allele it carries to emphasize that certain genes are x linked in contrast to an xw y male a hemizygous xwy male would have white eyes females with two x chromosomes can be one of three genotypes xw xw white eyed xwxw red eyed because w is dominant to w or xw xw red eyed as shown in fig morgans assumption that the gene for eye color is x linked explains the results of his breeding experiments crisscross inheritance for example occurs because the only x chromosome in sons of a white eyed mother xwxw must carry the w allele so the sons will be white eyed in contrast because daughters of a red eyed xw y father must receive a w bearing x chromosome from their father they should all have red eyes validation of the chromosome theory from the analysis of nondisjunction although morgans work strongly supported the hypothesis that the gene for eye color lies on the x chromosome he himself continued to question the validity of the chromosome theory until calvin bridges one of his top students found another key piece of evidence bridges repeated the cross morgan had performed between white eyed females and red eyed males but this time he did the experiment on a larger scale as expected the progeny of this cross consisted mostly of red eyed females and white eyed males however about in every males had red eyes and about the same small fraction of females had white eyes figure a drosophila eye color gene

progeny of this cross consisted mostly of red eyed females and white eyed males however about in every males had red eyes and about the same small fraction of females had white eyes figure nondisjunction rare mistakes in meiosis help confirm the chromosome theory a rare events of nondisjunction in an xx female produce xx and o eggs the results of normal disjunction in the female are not shown xo males are sterile because the missing y chromosome is needed for male fertility in drosophila b in an xxy female the three sex chromosomes can pair and segregate in two ways producing progeny with unusual sex chromosome complements w a nondisjunction in an xx female b segregation in an xxy female white eyed y red eyed white eyed red eyed meiosis y o p gametes nondisjunction normal segregation y o w w red xw dies white o y dies y wy w y less frequent more frequent white w w w w w gametes w w w w w y y y w w w y y meiosis x y yy red red white dies white red dies bridges hypothesized that these exceptions arose through rare events in which the x chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis in females he called such failures in chromosome segregation nondisjunction mistakes leading to nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis i or meiosis ii but in either case nondisjunction would result in some eggs with two x chromosomes and others with none as fig a shows fertilization of these chromosomally abnormal eggs could produce four types of zygotes xxy with two x chromosomes from the egg and a y from the sperm xxx with two xs from the egg and one x from the sperm xo with the lone sex chromosome from the sperm and no sex chromosome from the egg and oy with the only sex chromosome again coming from the sperm when bridges examined the sex chromosomes of the rare white eyed females produced in his large scale cross he found that they were indeed xxy individuals who must have received two x chromosomes and with them two w alleles from their white eyed xwxw mothers the exceptional red eyed males emerging from the cross were xo their eye color showed that they must have obtained their sole sex chromosome from their xw y fathers in this study then transmission of the white gene alleles followed the predicted behavior of x chromosomes during rare meiotic mistakes indicating that the x chromosome carries the gene for eye color these results also suggested that zygotes with the two other abnormal sex chromosome karyotypes expected from nondisjunction in females xxx and oy die during embryonic development and thus produce no progeny because xxy white eyed females have three sex chromosomes rather than the normal two bridges reasoned they would produce four kinds of eggs xy and x or xx and y fig b you can visualize the formation of these four kinds of eggs by imagining that when the three chromosomes pair and disjoin during meiosis two chromosomes must go to one pole and one chromosome to the other with this kind of segregation only two results are possible either one x and the y go to one pole and the second x to the other yielding xy and x gametes or the two xs go to one pole and the y to the other yielding xx and y gametes the first of these two scenarios occurs more often because it comes about when the two similar x chromosomes pair with each other ensuring that they will go to opposite poles during the first meiotic division the second less likely possibility happens only if the two x chromosomes fail to pair with each other bridges next predicted that fertilization of these four kinds of eggs from an xxy female by normal sperm would generate an array of sex chromosome karyotypes associated with specific eye colors in the progeny bridges verified all his predictions when he analyzed the eye colors and sex chromosomes of a large number of offspring for instance he showed cytologically that all of the white eyed females emerging from the cross in fig b had two x chromosomes and one y chromosome while one half of the white eyed males had a single x chromosome and two y chromosomes bridges painstaking observations provided compelling evidence that specific genes do in fact reside on specific chromosomes the chromosome theory integrates many aspects of gene behavior mendel had assumed that genes are located in cells the chromosome theory assigned the genes to a specific kind of structure within cells and explained alternative alleles as physically matching parts of homologous chromosomes in so doing the theory provided an explanation of mendels laws the mechanism of meiosis ensures that the matching parts of homologous chromosomes will segregate to different gametes except in rare instances of nondisjunction accounting for the segregation of alleles predicted by mendels first law because each homologous chromosome pair aligns independently of all others at meiosis i genes carried on different chromosomes will assort independently as predicted by mendels second law the chromosome theory is also able to explain the creation of new alleles through mutation a spontaneous change in a particular gene that is in a particular part of a chromosome if a mutation occurs in the germ line it can be transmitted to subsequent generations finally through mitotic cell divisions in the embryo and after birth each cell in a multicellular organism receives the same chromosomes and thus the same maternal and paternal alleles of each gene as the zygote received from the egg and sperm at fertilization in this way an individuals genome the chromosomes and genes he or she carries remains constant throughout life essential concepts segregation of homologous chromosomes into daughter cells at meiosis i explains mendels first law independent alignment of homologs with respect to each other and crossing over of nonsister chromatids during meiosis i explain mendels second law in organisms with xx xy sex determination males are hemizygous for x linked genes while females have two

likely inherited some form of red green color blindness a recessive condition that runs in families and affects mostly males among caucasians in north america and europe of men but only of women have this vision defect figure suggests to readers with normal color vision what people with red green color blindness actually see in e b wilson a contributor to the chromosome theory of inheritance combined family studies of the inheritance of color blindness with recent knowledge of the roles of the x and y chromosomes in sex determination to make the first assignment of a human gene to a particular chromosome the gene for red green color blindness he said lies on the x because the condition usually passes from a maternal grandfather through an unaffected carrier mother to roughly of the grandsons several years after wilson made this gene assignment pedigree analysis established that various forms of hemophilia or bleeders disease in which the blood fails to clot properly also result from mutations on the x chromosome that give rise to a relatively rare recessive trait in this context rare means infrequent in the population the family histories under review including one following the descendants of queen victoria of england fig a showed that relatively rare x linked traits appear more often in males than in females and often skip generations the clues that suggest x linked recessive inheritance in a pedigree are summarized in table unlike color blindness and hemophilia some although very few of the known rare mutations on the x chromosome are dominant to the wild type allele with such dominant x linked mutations more females than males show the aberrant phenotype this phenomenon occurs because all the daughters of an affected male but none of the sons will have the condition while one half the sons and one half the daughters of an affected female will receive the dominant allele and therefore show the phenotype see table figure red green color blindness

hypophosphatemia vitamin d resistant rickets or hypophosphatemia is an example of an x linked dominant trait figure b presents the pedigree of a family affected by this disease in xx human females one x chromosome is inactivated the xx and xy system of sex determination presents human cells with a curious problem that requires a solution called dosage compensation as mentioned earlier the x chromosome contains about genes and the proteins that they specify need to be present in the same amounts in male and female cells to compensate for female cells having two copies of each x linked gene and male cells having only one xx cells inactivate one of their two x chromosomes almost all of the genes on the inactivated x chromosome are turned off so no gene products can be made x inactivation occurs at about two weeks after fertilization when an xx human embryo is composed of only cells at that time each cell chooses one x chromosome at random to condense into a so called barr body and thereby inactivate it barr bodies named after the cytologist murray barr who discovered them appear as small dark chromosomes in interphase cells treated with a dna stain that allows chromosomes to be visible under a light microscope fig each embryonic cell decides independently which x chromosome will be inactivated either the x inherited from the mother or the paternal x once the determination is made it is clonally perpetuated so that all of the millions of cells descended by mitosis from a particular embryonic cell condense the same x chromosome to a barr body fig a human females are thus a patchwork of cells some containing a maternally derived active x chromosome and the others an active paternal x fig b the fast forward box visualizing x chromosome inactivation in transgenic mice explains how scientists have recently developed technology in mice to visualize both outside and inside the body the clonal patches of cells that express the genes on one x chromosome or the other the phenomenon of x chromosome inactivation may have interesting effects on the traits controlled by x linked genes when females are heterozygous at an x linked gene parts of their bodies are in effect hemizygous for one allele and parts are hemizygous for the other allele in terms of gene function moreover which body parts are functionally hemizygous for one allele or the other is random even identical twins who have identical alleles of all of their genes will have a different pattern of x chromosome inactivation in fig b females heterozygous for the x linked recessive trait anhidrotic epidermal dysplasia have patches of skin that lack sweat glands interspersed with patches of normal skin the phenotype of a patch depends upon which x chromosome is inactivated each patch is a clone of skin cells derived from a single embryonic cell that made the decision to inactivate one of the x chromosomes in a second example women heterozygous for an x linked recessive hemophilia allele are called carriers of the disease allele even though they may have some symptoms of hemophilia the severity of the condition depends on the particular random pattern of cells that inactivated the disease allele and cells that inactivated the normal allele in chapter we discussed how chance events work through genes to affect phenotype x inactivation is a perfect example of such an event recall that the two tips of the x chromosome the pseudoautosomal regions pars contain genes also present at the tips of the y chromosome fig in order to equalize the dosage of these genes in xx and xy cells the par genes on the barr body x chromosome escape inactivation this feature of dosage compensation may explain at least in part why xxy males klinefelter syndrome and xo females turner syndrome have abnormal morphological features although one of the two x chromosomes in xxy males becomes a barr body klinefelter males have three doses rather than the normal two of the genes in the par regions the single x chromosome in xo cells does not become a barr body yet these cells have only one dose of the par genes rather than two in xx females x chromosome inactivation is common to mammals and we will present the molecular details of this process in later chapters it is nonetheless important to realize that other organisms compensate for sex chromosome differences in alternative ways fruit flies for example hyperactivate the single x chromosome in xy male cells so that most x chromosome genes produce twice as much protein product as each x chromosome in a female the nematode c elegans in contrast ratchets down the level of gene activity on each of the x chromosomes in xx hermaphrodites relative to the single x in xo males table pedigree patterns suggesting sex linked inheritance x linked recessive trait the trait appears in more males than females because a female must receive two copies of the rare defective allele to display the phenotype whereas a hemizygous male with only one copy will show it the mutation will never pass from father to son because sons receive only a y chromosome from their father an affected male passes the x linked mutation to all his daughters who are thus carriers each son of these carrier females has a onehalf chance to inherit the defective allele and thus the trait the trait often skips a generation as the mutation passes from grandfather through a carrier daughter to grandson the trait can appear in successive generations when a sister of an affected male is a carrier if she is each of her sons has a one half chance of being affected with the rare affected homozygous female all her sons will be affected and all her daughters will be carriers x linked dominant trait more females than males show the aberrant trait the trait is seen in every generation as long as affected males have female children all the daughters but none of the sons of an affected male will be affected this criterion is the most useful for distinguishing an x linked dominant trait from an autosomal dominant trait the sons and daughters of an affected female each have a one half chance of being affected for incompletely dominant x linked traits carrier females may show the trait in less extreme form than males with the defective allele y linked trait the trait is seen only in males all male descendants of an affected man will exhibit the trait not only do females not exhibit the trait they also cannot transmit it figure barr bodies are densely staining particles in xx cell nuclei

chromosomes hao wu and jeremy nathans molecular biology and genetics neuroscience and hhmi johns hopkins medical school maleness and male fertility are the only known y linked traits in humans theoretically phenotypes caused by mutations on the y chromosome should also be identifiable by pedigree analysis such traits would pass from an affected father to all of his sons and from them to all future male descendants females would neither exhibit nor transmit a y linked phenotype see table however besides the determination of maleness itself as well as contributions to sperm formation and thus male fertility no clear cut y linked visible traits have turned up in humans the paucity of known ylinked traits reflects the fact that as mentioned earlier the small y chromosome contains very few genes indeed one would expect the y chromosome to have only a limited effect on phenotype because normal xx females do perfectly well without it autosomal genes contribute to sexual dimorphism not all genes that produce sexual dimorphism differences in the two sexes reside on the x or y chromosomes some autosomal genes govern traits that appear in one sex but not the other or traits that are expressed differently in the two sexes sex limited traits affect a structure or process that is found in one sex but not the other mutations in genes for sex limited traits can influence only the phenotype of the sex that expresses those structures or processes a vivid example of a sex limited trait occurs in drosophila males homozygous for an autosomal recessive mutation known as stuck which affects the ability of mutant males to retract their penis and release the claspers by which they hold on to female genitalia during copulation the mutant males have difficulty separating from females after mating in extreme cases both individuals die forever caught in their embrace because females lack penises and claspers homozygous stuck mutant females can mate normally sex influenced traits show up in both sexes but the expression of such traits may differ between the two sexes because of hormonal differences pattern baldness a condition in which hair is lost prematurely from the top of the head but not from the sides fig is a sexinfluenced trait in humans although pattern baldness is a complex trait that can be affected by many genes an autosomal gene appears to play an important role in certain families men in these families who are heterozygous for the balding allele lose their hair while still in their s whereas heterozygous women do not show any significant hair loss in contrast homozygotes in both sexes become bald though the onset of baldness in homozygous women is usually much later in life than in homozygous men this sex influenced trait is thus dominant in men recessive in women mutations in sex determination pathway genes can result in intersexuality disorders we previously saw that the sry gene on the y chromosome is essential to maleness because it initiates testis development early in embryogenesis but the functions of many genes are required for testis development or for subsequent events that rely on hormones made in the testes for the development of sexual organs some of these genes are autosomal and some are x linked in either case an xy individual with mutant alleles for any of these genes may have unusual intersexual phenotypes in one important example xy people with nonfunctional mutant alleles of the x linked ar gene specifying the androgen receptor have a disorder known as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais these xy individuals have testes that make the hormone testosterone but in the absence of the androgen receptor to which it binds the testosterone has no effect without the androgen receptor these people cannot develop male genitalia penis and scrotum nor male internal duct systems the vas deferens seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts instead their external genitalia assume the default female state labia and clitoris however the testes make another hormone that prevents the formation of female internal duct systems including the fallopian tubes uterus and vagina the result is that persons with cais are externally female but sterile because they lack the internal duct systems of either sex essential concepts sex linked x linked traits show sex specific inheritance patterns because sons always inherit their fathers y chromosome while daughters always inherit their fathers x chromosome random inactivation of either the maternal or paternal x chromosome in xx cells ensures that male and female mammalian cells express equivalent amounts of the proteins encoded by most x linked genes mutations of genes whether autosomal or x linked can have different effects in males and females figure male pattern baldness a sex influenced trait a john adams second president of the united states at about age b john quincy adams son of john adams and the sixth president of the united states at about the same age the father to son transmission suggests that male pattern baldness in the adams family is likely determined by an allele of an autosomal gene a bettmann corbis b the corcoran gallery of art corbis whats next t h morgan and his students collectively known as the drosophila group acknowledged that mendelian genetics could exist independently of chromosomes why then we are often asked do you drag in the chromosomes our answer is that because the chromosomes furnish exactly the kind of mechanism that mendelian laws call for and since there is an ever increasing body of information that points clearly to the chromosomes as the bearers of the mendelian factors it would be folly to close ones eyes to so patent a relation moreover as biologists we are interested in heredity not primarily as a mathematical formulation but rather as a problem concerning the cell the egg and the sperm the drosophila group went on to find several xlinked mutations in addition to white eyes one made the body yellow instead of brown another shortened the wings yet another made bent instead of straight body bristles these findings raised several compelling questions first if the genes for all of these traits are physically linked together on the x chromosome does this linkage affect their ability to assort independently and if so how second does each gene have an exact chromosomal address and if so does this specific location in any way affect its transmission in chapter we describe how the drosophila group and others analyzed the transmission patterns of genes on the same chromosome in terms of known chromosome movements during meiosis and how they then used the information obtained to localize genes to specific chromosomal positions solved problems in humans chromosome sometimes has a heavily stained area in the long arm near the centromere this feature can be seen through the microscope but has no effect on the phenotype of the person carrying it when such a blob exists on a particular copy of chromosome it is a constant feature of that chromosome and is inherited a couple conceived a child but the fetus had multiple abnormalities and was miscarried when the chromosomes of the fetus were studied it was discovered that it had three copies of chromosome it was trisomic for chromosome and that two of the three chromosome s had large blobs both chromosome homologs in the mother lacked blobs but the father was heterozygous for blobs which parent experienced nondisjunction and in which meiotic division did it occur answer this problem requires an understanding of nondisjunction during meiosis when individual chromosomes contain some distinguishing feature that allows one homolog to be distinguished from another it is possible to follow the path of the two homologs through meiosis because the fetus had two chromosome s with the blob we can conclude that the extra chromosome came from the father the only parent with a blobbed chromosome we know that nondisjunction must be involved because normal meiosis in the father would generate gametes with only a single chromosome with the blob as a result the fetus could have only a single chromosome with the blob meiosis i normal meiosis in father meiosis ii gametes in which meiotic division did the nondisjunction occur when nondisjunction occurs during meiosis i homologs fail to segregate to opposite poles if this occurred in the father the chromosome with the blob and the normal chromosome would segregate into the same cell a secondary spermatocyte after meiosis ii the gametes resulting from this cell would carry both types of chromosomes if such sperm fertilized a normal egg the zygote would have two copies of the normal chromosome and one copy of the chromosome with a blob on the other hand if nondisjunction occurred during meiosis ii in the father in a secondary spermatocyte containing the blobbed chromosome sperm with two copies of the blob marked chromosome would be produced after fertilization with a normal egg the result would be a zygote of the type seen in this spontaneous abortion meiosis i ndj in meiosis ii fertilization mothers gamete

because she has normal color vision her other x chromosome must be xcb the man she mates with has normal color vision and therefore has an xcby genotype their children could with equal probability be xcbxcb normal female xcbxcb carrier female xcby normal male or xcby color blind male b if the man with normal color vision had a color blind father the xcb chromosome would not have been passed on to him because a male does not inherit an x chromosome from his father the man has the genotype xcby and cannot pass on the color blind allele vocabulary choose the best matching phrase in the right

was published in by nettie stevens because it was hard to reproduce photographs at the time she recorded these observations as camera lucida sketches one such drawing of a completely normal cell division in the mealworm tenebrio molitor is shown here the techniques of the time were relatively unsophisticated by todays standards and they did not allow her to resolve chromosomal structures that

drawing c how many chromosomes are present in normal tenebrio molitor gametes a person is simultaneously heterozygous for two autosomal genetic traits one is a recessive condition for albinism alleles a and a this albinism gene is found near the centromere on the long arm of an acrocentric autosome the other trait is the dominantly inherited huntington disease alleles hd and hd the huntington gene is located near the telomere of one of the arms of a metacentric autosome draw all copies of the two relevant chromosomes in this person as they would appear during metaphase of a mitosis b meiosis i and c meiosis ii in each figure label the location on every chromatid of the alleles for these two genes assuming that no recombination takes place assuming i that the two chromosomes in every homologous pair carry different alleles of some genes and ii that no crossing over takes place how many genetically different offspring could any one human couple potentially produce which of these two assumptions i or ii is more realistic in the moss polytrichum commune the haploid chromosome number is a haploid male gamete fuses with a haploid female gamete to form a diploid cell that divides and develops into the multicellular sporophyte cells of the sporophyte then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells called spores what is the probability that an individual spore will contain a set of chromosomes all of which came from the male gamete assume that no recombination occurs can you think of anything that would prevent meiosis from occurring in an organism whose genome is always haploid sister chromatids are held together through metaphase of mitosis by complexes of cohesin proteins that form rubber band like rings bundling the two sister chromatids cohesin rings are found both at centromeres and at many locations scattered along the length of the chromosomes the rings are destroyed by protease enzymes at the beginning of mitotic anaphase allowing the sister chromatids to separate a cohesin complexes between sister chromatids are also responsible for keeping homologous chromosomes together until anaphase of meiosis i with this point in mind which of the two diagrams that follow i or ii properly represents the arrangement of chromatids during prophase through metaphase of meiosis i explain what does your answer to part a allow you to infer about the nature of cohesin complexes at the centromere versus those along the chromosome arms suggest a molecular hypothesis to explain your inference i ii the pseudoautosomal regions pars of the x and y chromosomes enable the sex chromosomes to pair and synapse during meiosis in males given the location of the sry gene near par can you propose a mechanism for how the mutant x and y chromosomes in fig in which part of the x is on the y and part of the y is on the x may have arisen during meiosis remarkably the platypus has sex chromosomes the largest number found in any mammal the female platypus has five pairs of different x chromosomes x x while the male has x x and also five different ys y y during meiosis in the male the five xs always end up together in one gamete and the five ys always end up together in another gamete to achieve this segregation during prophase of meiosis i the sex chromosomes form a long chain always in the order x y x y x y x y x y in which the chromosomes are held together through pseudoautosomal regions pars a how many different pars must exist to allow the formation of these chains hint to answer this question try drawing the chain of chromosomes b in terms

d how many ova develop from primary oocytes e how many ova develop from secondary oocytes f how many ova develop from polar bodies women sometimes develop benign tumors called ovarian teratomas or dermoid cysts in their ovaries such a tumor begins when a primary oocyte escapes from its prophase i arrest and finishes meiosis i within the ovary normally meiosis i does not finish until the primary oocyte is expelled from the ovary upon ovulation the secondary oocyte then develops as if it were an embryo development is disorganized however and results in a tumor containing differentiated diploid tissues including teeth hair bone muscle and nerve if a dermoid cyst forms in a woman whose genotype is aa what are the possible genotypes of the cyst assuming no recombination in a certain strain of turkeys unfertilized eggs sometimes develop parthenogenetically to produce diploid offspring females have zw and males have zz sex chromosomes assume that ww cells are inviable what distribution of sexes would you expect to see among the parthenogenetic offspring according to each of the following models for how parthenogenesis occurs a the eggs develop from oogonial cells that never undergo meiosis b the eggs go all the way through meiosis and then duplicate their chromosomes to become diploid c the eggs go through meiosis i and the chromatids separate to create diploidy d the egg goes all the way through meiosis and then fuses at random with one of its three polar bodies this scenario assumes the first polar body goes through meiosis ii section imagine you have two pure breeding lines of canaries one with yellow feathers and the other with brown feathers in crosses between these two strains yellow female brown male gives only brown sons and daughters while brown female yellow male gives only brown sons and yellow daughters propose a hypothesis to explain these results a system of sex determination known as haplodiploidy is found in honeybees females are diploid and males drones are haploid male offspring result from the development of unfertilized eggs sperm are produced by mitosis in males and fertilize eggs in the females ivory eye is a recessive characteristic in honeybees wild type eyes are brown a what progeny would result from an ivory eyed queen and a brown eyed drone give both genotype and phenotype for progeny produced from fertilized and nonfertilized eggs b what would result from crossing a daughter from the mating in part a with a brown eyed drone in drosophila the autosomal recessive brown eye color mutation displays interactions with both the x linked recessive vermilion mutation and the autosomal recessive scarlet mutation flies homozygous for brown and simultaneously hemizygous or homozygous for vermilion have white eyes flies simultaneously homozygous for both the brown and scarlet mutations also have white eyes predict the f and f progeny of crossing the following truebreeding parents a vermilion females brown males b brown females vermilion males c scarlet females brown males d brown females scarlet males barred feather pattern is a z linked dominant trait in chickens what offspring would you expect from a the cross of a barred hen to a nonbarred rooster b the cross of an f rooster from part a to one of his sisters when calvin bridges observed a large number of offspring from a cross of white eyed female drosophila to red eyed males he found very rare white eyed females and red eyed males among the offspring he was able to show that these exceptions resulted from nondisjunction such that the white eyed females had received two xs from the egg and a y from the sperm while the red eyed males had received no sex chromosome from the egg and an x from the sperm what progeny would have arisen from these same kinds of nondisjunctional events if they had occurred in the male parent what would their eye colors have been in a vial of drosophila a research student noticed several female flies but no male flies with bag wings each consisting of a large liquid filled blister instead of the usual smooth wing blade when bag winged females were crossed with wild type males of the progeny were bag winged females were normalwinged females and were normal winged males explain these results in calvin bridges began studying an x linked recessive mutation causing eosin colored eyes in drosophila within an otherwise true breeding culture of eosin eyed flies he noticed rare variants that had much lighter cream colored eyes by intercrossing these variants he was able to make a truebreeding cream eyed stock bridges now crossed males from this cream eyed stock with true breeding wild type females all the f progeny had red wildtype eyes when f flies were intercrossed the f progeny were females with red eyes males with red eyes males with eosin eyes and males with cream eyes assume that these numbers represent an ratio a formulate a hypothesis to explain the f and f results assigning phenotypes to all possible genotypes b what do you predict in the f and f generations if the parental cross is between truebreeding eosin eyed males and true breeding cream eyed females c what do you predict in the f and f generations if the parental cross is between true breeding eosin eyed females and true breeding creameyed males in drosophila a cross was made between a yellowbodied male with vestigial not fully developed wings and a wild type female brown body the f generation consisted of wild type males and wild type females f males and females were crossed and the f progeny consisted of yellow bodied males with vestigial wings yellow bodied males with normal wings males with brown bodies and vestigial wings wild type males brown bodied females with vestigial wings and wild type females explain the inheritance of the two genes in question based on these results as we learned in this chapter the white mutation of drosophila studied by thomas hunt morgan is x linked and recessive to wild type when truebreeding white eyed males carrying this mutation were crossed with true breeding purple eyed females all the f progeny had wild type red eyes when the f progeny were intercrossed the f progeny emerged in the ratio wild type females white eyed males wild type males purple eyed females purple eyed males a formulate a hypothesis to explain the inheritance of these eye colors b predict the f and f progeny if the parental cross was reversed that is if the parental cross was between true breeding white eyed females and true breeding purple eyed males section the

caused by a recessive or a dominant allele b is the gene sex linked or autosomal chapter the chromosome theory of inheritance the x linked gene responsible for dmd encodes a protein called dystrophin that is required for muscle function dystrophin protein is not secreted it remains in the cells that produce it given what you know about barr body formation do you think that females heterozygous for the recessive dmd disease allele could have the disease in some parts of their bodies and not others males have hemophilia when they are hemizygous for a nonfunctional recessive mutant allele of the x linked gene for clotting factor viii factor viii is normally secreted into the blood serum by cells in the bone marrow and other specialized cells that produce it a do you think that females heterozygous for the hemophilia disease allele could have hemophilia in some parts of their bodies and not others b if such a female carrier of hemophilia suffered a cut would her blood coagulate form clots faster slower or in about the same time as that of an individual homozygous for a normal allele of the factor viii gene would the rate of clotting vary significantly among heterozygous females
