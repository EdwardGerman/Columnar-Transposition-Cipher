governments account of it a gulf has emerged between the chinese economy as many chinese are experiencing it and beijings narrative of it and that gulf is only widening for many ordinary chinese one of the worst economic slowdowns the country has faced in decades has translated into widespread pessimism and resignation but state media and officials continue to declare that any challenges are blips concerns about the economy propaganda outlets have insisted have been inflated by western politicians and media outlets engaged in cognitive warfare one social media account backed by chinas

august this month beijing stopped publishing the youth unemployment rate which had been at a record high credit agence france presse getty images that sense of insecurity is almost universally shared within china now across all walks of life said chen zhiwu a professor of finance at the university of hong kong and that is why the government has been using all the official media and all other tools to convey a positive optimistic message the malaise is especially striking compared to the optimism many chinese felt earlier this year after beijing finally abandoned coronavirus restrictions that for three years had left many people unable to leave home and unwilling to spend ms qian the electronics store manager had hoped to buy a new car before her wedding later this year but after seeing

bad here too said ms zhangs husband who gave only his surname xue people dont spend money like they did before the pandemic where theyd buy whatever they want ms zhang said as their teenage son slouched at one of the empty tables playing with his phone they had cut back on their own spending too mr xue said he had essentially stopped buying fruit limiting himself to staples and vegetables we thought if we just got through those three years and worked hard there would definitely be hope he said and then it turned out that when the pandemic ended things just got worse officials have acknowledged that the economy is facing new challenges describing the recovery as wavelike while maintaining that the overall outlook is positive but the remedies they have offered are unlikely to be effective economists said despite urging consumers to spend more the government has rejected the idea of cash handouts to households calling it too costly it has brandished tax incentives for purchases of new homes even as it has continued to erode the already weak social safety net that makes many chinese leery of big purchases a dior storefront with mannequins and handbags on display the wealthy have continued to spend on luxury goods but many chinese have stopped spending on big ticket items credit qilai shen for the new york times on monday the ministry of finance halved the tax on stock transactions in an attempt to boost investor confidence but that would not remedy how unwilling people are to buy stocks in the first place given a lack of faith that they would grow in value said professor chen when the future is so uncertain then it does not matter what kind of transaction costs you charge detachment between the top leadership and the reality of many chinese he added is clearly there the governments blame of external forces for the slowdown does have supporters wang ainian a barber in chedun pointed to news reports about the trade war with the united states and japanese restrictions on the export of computing chips when asked why business had slowed at local factories the economic pain has also been spread unevenly across the country the wealthy more insulated from uncertainties continue to spend on luxury goods many malls and train stations are bustling again though most shoppers and travelers are spending less and choosing cheaper destinations

negotiations between medicare and manufacturers were a significant element in last years inflation reduction act michael s williamson the washington post the biden administration tuesday identified expensive prescription drugs that will be included in price negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers as the government seeks to ease the financial burden on older and disabled americans an unprecedented step in a long political war over the nations exorbitant drug costs half of these first drugs chosen for price negotiations are medications used to prevent blood clots and treat diabetes and were taken by millions of people on medicare in the past year according to a list released by federal health officials who oversee medicare the vast public health insurance system others are used to treat heart trouble autoimmune disease and cancer consumers will not see benefits swiftly with the lower negotiated prices due to become available in early the top three of the drugs on the widely anticipated list include eliquis a blood thinner jardiance which treats diabetes and heart failure and xarelto another blood thinner they cost medicare billion billion and billion respectively in the past year medications could be targeted for price negotiation if they are available under medicare drug benefits lack certain competition to push down their prices and have been sold for at least several years to give drugmakers time to help recoup the expense of developing them tuesdays step toward reducing medicare drug prices was a significant element in last years inflation reduction act a law that president biden and his aides herald as a policy victory even though the number of medications and the timing of the first price reductions are less ambitious than some democrats had sought for many years and the fate of the entire negotiation plan rests with the courts because six drug manufacturers the chamber of commerce and the pharmaceutical industrys main trade group have lodged separate lawsuits around the country trying to block it still the biden administration democratic allies in congress and consumer health care advocates portrayed this initial list of drugs as a milestone to shore up the financial stability of the medicare system and ease the burden on its beneficiaries medicare is a federal insurance system for people who are at least along with younger adults who have disabilities when last years law passed the congressional budget office predicted the negotiations would save the program slightly more than billion during the following decade there is no reason why americans should be forced to pay more than any developed nation for life saving prescriptions just to pad big pharmas pockets biden said in a statement issued by the white house reflecting his intention to use the issue as a feature of his campaign for reelection more than percent of the million people on medicare take prescription medication and percent take at least four prescriptions according to a survey this summer by kff a health care policy organization the rest of the list consists of januvia farxiga and novolog which treat diabetes among other conditions enbrel and stelara for arthritis and psoriasis and entresto for heart failure and imbruvica for cancers of the blood wall street analysts widely expected that most of the drugs selected for price negotiations would appear on the list based on medicare expenditures and their sales in the united states among other criteria for seniors enrolled in medicare their average annual out of pocket costs ranged from for diabetes drug novolog to for cancer drug imbruvica including those with financial assistance all told hhs estimates that about million seniors enrolled in medicares prescription drug program used one or more of the drugs in and paid a total of billion out of pocket the drugs identified tuesday represent the first wave of medicines destined for price negotiation with the roster expanding in future years for this initial batch manufacturers have until the start of october to agree to price negotiation with the centers for medicare and medicaid services if they do the companies will quickly need to disclose an array of data to cms for each selected drug regarding revenue and what the manufacturer spent to research develop and produce it if a manufacturer refuses to negotiate or wont agree to what federal rules call a maximum fair price the company will face a substantial tax or must withdraw from medicare and medicaid the nations largest public health insurance program designed for people with low incomes to be considered for the price negotiation a drug must have no competition from a less expensive generic competitor and a biologic a category of drugs made from living organisms must not compete with any cheaper version known as biosimilars the number of drugs involved will expand slightly during the next two years with a total of each of the next two years and drugs in following years this year and next the drugs are part of medicares part d the programs drug insurance created two decades ago after that the drugs can come from part d or from part b such as cancer therapies which are administered by doctors senior health administration officials briefing reporters early tuesday and speaking on the condition of anonymity before a speech by the president said cms started with nearly prescription drugs that are covered through part d they then whittled the possibilities to that dont have much competition and that result in the highest costs to medicare including drugs that were approved by the food and drug administration at least seven years ago and biologics approved at least years ago a few other criteria were used too from there cms ranked the choosing the with the highest costs to the program limited though it is the arrival of medicare drug price negotiation is a sharp break from medicares history when the program was created in the s it covered drugs that were administered in a doctors office part b but excluded medications that patients took on their own despite efforts over the decades to add outpatient drug benefits they were woven into larger health reform proposals that failed and the broader drug benefits did not become part of the program until a set of medicare changes adopted by congress in to win republican support that statute included language that prohibited any role for the government to negotiate medication prices the inflation reduction act known as ira rescinded the prohibition since the outpatient drug benefits embedded in the law began three years later medicare beneficiaries have been able to get that coverage by buying a separate drug plan through part d or as part of managed care plans known as medicare advantage either way beneficiaries still pay some of the cost of getting the medicines and the government has not influenced the prices that pharmaceutical companies set the push for price negotiation faced intense opposition from pharmaceutical companies which contend that capping potential earning erodes their ability to invest in further research and development after a rare loss on capitol hill the industry and its business allies have turned to the courts with the eight cases that could take years to resolve and could land before the supreme court if the negotiation process stands industry analysts predict it will have profound ripple effect prices negotiated and made public by medicare could affect negotiations between commercial insurers and drugmakers in turn pharmaceutical companies could focus on developing larger molecule drugs such as vaccines and gene therapies that are exempted from potential medicare price negotiations for a longer period than prescription pills the ultimate impacts of the law are hard to predict even companies critical of it acknowledge they could benefit from provisions that make their medications more affordable to patients the ira law is not all gloom and doom for biopharma since it will reduce seniors out of pocket costs motivating patients to stay on them longer according to analysts at leerink partners a health care focused investment bank and some drugs designated for negotiation at first might not remain on the list for long because they are scheduled to lose their patent protection soon after the lower prices take effect meaning they would have competition and no longer be eligible for the negotiated prices for the biden administration the inflation reduction act provision is a centerpiece of a battle to curb drug prices that it is waging on several fronts under the law medicare beneficiaries pay a limit of a month for insulin biden issued an executive order last year directing the department of health and human services to study new models to lower drug costs for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries in may hhs proposed a rule that would give the department and states more leverage to negotiate payment for the most expensive drugs covered by medicaid and the federal trade commission has taken a more aggressive approach to pharmaceutical mergers citing concerns about price increases when it filed suit in may to block amgen from acquiring horizon therapeutics even though the two companies dont directly compete because the impact of the medicare drug price provision will unfold over years the negotiated prices may have a minimal effect on some drugs including eliquis a blood thinning medication that cost medicare billion in by far the most of any drug eliquis made by bristol myers squibb and pfizer is set to lose patent protection in the year that medicares negotiated prices first takes effect whatever the impact is will not be long lasting on our portfolio angela hwang pfizers chief commercial officer said of eliquis in a call with financial analysts this month according to a transcript compiled by s p global market intelligence johnson johnson with three drugs on the list the most of any drugmaker was less conciliatory the iras policies put an artificial deadline on innovation threatening intellectual property protections and shortening the timeframe to deepen our understanding of patients unmet medical needs the company said in a statement tuesday bristol myers squibb said in a statement tuesday that eliquis was targeted for this program due to the sheer number of medicare patients who benefit from the medicine not its price what our post debate poll means for desantis ramaswamy and haley analysis by aaron blake from left former vice president mike pence florida gov ron desantis and former south carolina governor nikki haley right listen as vivek ramaswamy speaks during wednesday nights republican presidential debate joshua lott the washington post twenty nine percent of republican primary voters who watched wednesdays debate said that florida gov ron desantis won while percent said the same of businessman vivek ramaswamy according to a new poll from the washington post fivethirtyeight and ipsos former south carolina governor nikki haley came in third at percent desantiss political operation responded as expected by hyping its candidate as the winner ramaswamys share also suggests he will be a force in the presidential primary race ahead but in context their showings are a bit less impressive and the actual impact on the race is probably larger for haley the first thing to remember is that polling on debates often reflects peoples preconceived notions about the candidates you already like desantis youre predisposed to believe your guy won thats perhaps less the case in primary debates where polarization isnt as large a factor but the rule still applies donald trump is the clear front runner ahead of the primaries but he didnt participate in the debate desantis is pulling more than one third of the non trump vote in the fivethirtyeight national polling average ramaswamy about one quarter this means that desantis draws a larger percentage of the non trump vote in the national polling average than he did among debate watchers who deemed him the victor ramaswamys numbers are about the same for both metrics if theres one candidate who overperformed by this measure its haley shes taking only about percent of the non trump vote in the national polling average but nearly double that number say she won the debate so who are the people who say these candidates won and did the candidates expand their appeal those might be the more interesting questions for desantis the group saying he won was largely made up of people who already said they were considering him at percent just percent of people who had not previously considered desantis said he won ramaswamy and haley impressed more voters for whom they hadnt been on the radar ramaswamy was deemed the winner by percent of those not previously considering him while haley took percent among those who hadnt considered her before wednesday night thats likely in part because voters were less familiar with ramaswamy and haley but it suggests that those candidates might be expanding their appeal more than desantis is ramaswamys showing also comes with some sizable asterisks while he clearly appealed to many watchers he also polarized people his favorable rating increased among debate watchers by points from percent before to percent after his unfavorable rating increased by points from percent before to percent after as for who those voters were ramaswamys favorable and unfavorable increases were largely across the board but there were some differences one of his biggest unfavorable increases came among women while his favorable rating rose by percent among them his unfavorable rating rose by points ramaswamy who has made a point to defend trump and has offered a trumpian vision for the country also seemed to turn off trump skeptics in the gop among those not considering voting for trump his favorable rating stayed the same but his unfavorable rating jumped by points haleys numbers might be the most significant and not just because she overperformed her standing in the polls the data suggest the former united nations ambassador who tried to give her party some tough love on wednesday night won the battle over the trump skeptics in the party haley was the winner according to just percent of those who said they were considering voting for trump but percent of those who werent considering trump in the latter trump skeptic demographic she significantly outpaced two others with a potential claim to those voters former new jersey governor chris christie percent and former vice president mike pence percent haleys favorable ratings increased by double digits basically across the board but her biggest increases were with women percent those who rely more on the mainstream media than fox news and conservative media percent nonconservatives percent and those not considering trump percent so in the end haley probably expanded her appeal the most but she did so among a section of the party that isnt particularly large the challenge for her would be solidifying herself as the candidate of that wing of the party while still maintaining some appeal to the trump contingent which neither christie nor pence has managed to do ramaswamy meanwhile apparently cost himself a broader base of appeal with his very forceful debate performance but his path to relevance is clearly through the populist trumpian wing of the party and he likely did himself some good there we might expect both to rise in the polls more than desantis but we shouldnt really expect the race to be significantly recast in large part because all of these candidates are battling for the less than percent of voters who arent already on the trump train emily guskin contributed to this report the federal reserve is responsible for far more of the evils in this world than you can possibly imagine

the repatriation of customers stranded by mondays collapse of the uks air traffic control system with five flights scheduled to bring customers back to gatwick airport as airlines estimated the failure could cost them up to m airlines are facing costs in the tens of millions according to willie walsh the former chief executive of british airways who is now the director general of theinternational air transport association as disruption extended into the third day i would imagine at an industry level well be getting close to m of additional costs that airlines have encountered as a result of this failure walsh told the bbc although he cautioned it was too early to determine the eventual cost the chief executive of the air traffic control service nats formerly national air traffic services martin rolfe confirmed the chaos was caused when part of the system collapsed on monday because it didnt recognise a message rolfes comments appear to confirm claims by unnamed sources reported by the independent on tuesday that the failure was triggered when a french airline submitted a dodgy flight plan the system could not process walsh said the outage led to the cancellation of about flights to and from four uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and manchester on monday affecting the journeys of hundreds of thousands of passengers he said nats had questions to answer adding it was staggering that a single piece of data could have been at fault the airlines are not hopeful that they will be able to recoup any of their costs from nats according to walsh this is what really frustrates and angers airlines this was completely outside the control of the airlines and yet airlines are subject to paying customers for delays for cancellations for looking after them which is very considerable he said its very unfair because the air traffic control system which was at the heart of this failure doesnt pay a single penny rolfe apologised to affected passengers and said the company did not underestimate the impact of the outage we worked absolutely as quickly as we could to make sure we could safely restore the service rolfe told bbc radio s today programme almost all the time it handles it absolutely perfectly in fact this is staggering in the sense that it is incredibly rare and we make it our business to make sure it is incredibly rare asked why the flight data that caused widespread cancellations was not rejected like a piece of spam rolfe said our systems are safety critical systems they are dealing with the lives of passengers and the travelling public so even things like just throwing data away needs to be very carefully considered if you throw away a critical piece of data you may end up in the next seconds a minute or an hour

neighbouring states will feel threatened notably denis sassou nguesso in congo brazzaville and with some justification so far the ousting of president ali bongo ondimba after years in power appears to have significant popular support although it is difficult to tell so early this would not be surprising many of the military coups in recent years have been greeted by enthusiastic public celebrations some have been organised for the media to win swift legitimacy but many have been spontaneous outbursts of excitement at the simple prospect of change few doubt gabon needed a shake up the president inherited power from his father who ruled from until his death in gabon a member of the opec oil cartel with a production of barrels of crude a day should be relatively properous yet the quality of life of the vast proportion of its million inhabitants speaks volumes about the decades of mismanagement clientelism corruption and blatant political rigging that the bongo dynasty brought the exact motivation for the takeover will soon become clear it is unlikely to be the protection of gabons institutions from security or other threats as the new apparent rulers claimed in their first address the lack of concerted regional african or global response to the other recent coups is likely to have been a major factor in the soldiers decision to gamble their lives and livelihoods on a grab for power this failure has been more obvious than ever in recent weeks threats of military intervention from ecowas the west african regional block have yet to help restore mohamed bazoum the democratically elected president of niger ousted in july and sanctions are not having much effect either military regimes in mali and burkina faso appear entrenched and in sudan the biggest threat to the military factions that seized power in is one another in the case of gabon the military can count on popular support and that of the opposition a recent united nations development programme survey of thousands of people living in countries where coups had recently occurred found strong democratic aspirations this is true elsewhere too and is being reinforced as africa becomes more urban and educated but above all there is a desire for change as soon as possible even if this means it comes wearing combat fatigues there is a wider trend to watch as well many of the recent coups are in former french colonies and one cause is undoubtedly the revived memory of long exploitative rule from paris africa watchers have long worried about the inherent instability of the system left by france after it ended its direct colonial control across a swath of the continent this toxic mix of political manipulation financial control military intervention extractive commercial enterprise and cosy relations between elites is far from unique to francophone africa but is very entrenched there even today gabon too was a french colony as recalled by emmanuel macron when he met the french educated bongo in paris in late june the photos of the two presidents shaking hands may not have done either much good every coup is different but many outcomes resemble one another the new leaders of gabon will almost certainly follow the same path as their counterparts farther north and announce a transition period before new elections which will not be held for a long time in the meantime tearful pleas by bongo from his official residence to which he is now confined for supporters to make some noise are likely to fall on deaf ears top books about solitary living finding your way without the social template of romantic love is a tough challenge but writers from deborah levy to hanya yanagihara offer clues to how it can be done for most of us the idea of romantic love has lost hardly any of its allure it continues to be the focus of our collective fantasies it is perhaps the most essential component of what most people understand happiness to be but more people live alone now than at any other time in history people like me many of us willingly or not have said goodbye to the grand idea of love even if some of us still believe in it but can you really live a good life alone without a romantic relationship how sustainable is a model like that and how do you learn to live with being alone without it hurting without lying to yourself these were the questions that i didnt know the answers to when i started writing my book alone but i knew that i needed to find them some of the answers i found in literature in a wide array of essays and novels it turned out this is a small selection the cost of living by deborah levy many people find themselves in relationships that make them unhappy but are unable to end them because theyre afraid of being and staying alone its a fear that our culture deeply instils in all of us partly because there are too few books like this one the cost of living the second instalment of levys living autobiography series deals with what happens when life falls apart and we do not want to mend it any more its a book about what comes after marriage about breaking out of the societal roles all of us have internalised about wanting everything from life and the harsh but worthwhile price we pay for it bluets by maggie nelson whenever one of your friends is lovesick give them a copy of bluets its an essay of melancholy genius purportedly a meditation on the colour blue it examines the pains of pining for someone and in the end the subsiding of these pains nelson tries to find dignity in loneliness but fails arriving instead at embracing solitude as a way of relating to and fully seeing the world the essay is a marvel to read again and again ti amo by hanne rstavik there are times in life we all encounter crushing loneliness regardless of how many friends we have and whether were in a romantic relationship or not one of these times comes when somebody we love dies in her autofictional novella norwegian writer rstavik tries to come to terms with the loneliness of anticipatory grief she has moved to milan to be with the man she loves only to find out he has cancer and less than a year to live ti amo chronicles the daily life of someone who cant talk about whats going on inside her to anyone its a gripping book and impossible to forget the lonely city by olivia laing for anyone who wants to read and think about loneliness this is the holy grail olivia laing is such a masterful writer her reflections on the psychology and psychoanalysis of loneliness are as deft as they are enlightening and her shedding light on the art and lives of queer artists such as klaus nomi peter hujar and david wojnarowicz who at some point were almost forgotten is a joy throughout her essays laing makes clear that even though loneliness is debilitating and makes us feel unlike ourselves its very human too a little life by hanya yanagihara i personally feel that hanya yanagihara is our tolstoy in a way all three of her novels deal with people going through their lives alone this theme is most pronounced in a little life yanagihara rigorously examines how it is possible to lead a life shaped by trauma and whether an almost perfect adopted family can change the daily encounters with the psychological and bodily consequences of that trauma its a novel of an intensity beyond compare look at me by anita brookner im not sure which of anita brookners novels i love most they all are gorgeously written and deal with being single in a way that no novels have before or since brookner trains unflinching attention on the emotional vicissitudes of life in a society that gives single people the feeling they really are terrible failures despite its dry humour look at me is a book that can break your heart brookner makes her readers feel well mannered librarian fannys slow burning devastation acutely she leaves us breathless and a little devastated ourselves accident a days news by christa wolf wolf is the german writer i love most in this autofictional novel from she chronicles a day she spends by herself in a little house in the east german countryside trying to make sense of two competing events in her life the risky brain surgery her brother undergoes that day and the nuclear meltdown in cernobyl a few days before its a difficult book at times because wolf is grappling with something that our psyches usually dont allow us to see how helpless we are in the face of fateful events beyond our control and how catastrophically we are thrown into history accident is so inspiring because wolf knows that we have to deal with that fact alone and gives us a hard won example of how to do just that assembly by natasha brown there are different kinds of solitude and also different kinds of loneliness one of them is what the philosopher jill stauffer calls ethical loneliness its the feeling of being abandoned by the society we live in and being confronted with its unacknowledged injustices and cruelties browns minimalist novel quietly dissects what this kind of loneliness does to us it unhurriedly evokes our long history of oppression and shows the effects it has on the assembling of our identities its a haunting book that culminates in a decision you cant get out of your head the years by annie ernaux i know ernauxs masterpiece is not strictly a book about aloneness but its rich and multi faceted tapestry can teach us more about our solitary lives than most of the books i know the years is a meditation on the events of the french writers private life and the changing attitudes of the society during her lifetime uncompromisingly yet poetically she chronicles how a society produces loneliness by excluding people because of their sex gender identity or marriage status its hard to overstate how brilliant this book is im not able to do it justice if you havent read it already start now the vaster wilds by lauren groff due out next month this novel follows an unnamed girl who flees from a colonial settlement in s virginia to make her way through the forests and rivers of north america groff turns the ideological underpinnings of classic robinsonades deftly on their head during her fight for survival the girl comes to an understanding of the natural world and her life within it which is a rare testament to the spiritual

cnns cable tv ratings have been dropping faster than those of its competitors according to official figures quoted by the associated press earlier this year netflix streamers expansion into gaming is natural extension the queens gambit game is a chess simulator based on the adventures of the series main character beth harmon think of netflix and a memorable television show or movie will likely pop into your mind what did you most enjoy squid game bridgerton stranger things maybe soon the streaming service wants video games to be competing for a place on that list netflix says games are a key part of its proposition to stay relevant with audiences in years to come and is slowly ramping up plans to offer more gaming experiences to subscribers leanne loombe vice president of external games at netflix tells bbc news games are one of the biggest forms of entertainment out there today so it really is just a natural extension for netflix to include them as part of the subscription the lines between the different ways we enjoy our entertainment are blurring when youre in that moment looking to sit and watch a movie or be more active and play a game we want to make sure we have something for you our goal is to have a game on the service for everyone not focus on making one big experience but rather a selection of titles that members can choose to play since november games have been available to play on the netflix app but this development passed many users by loombe says the streaming service has deliberately not been shouting from the rooftops but instead taking their time to understand the market place first so far whats being offered are mobile games with some tied to famous netflix franchises like stranger things and others independent of the service like reigns three kingdoms currently theyre only available to play on mobile devices although tests are under way to see how they could work on tvs and computers this low key approach is a sensible move according to games journalist shay thompson who explains the industry is littered with the failed attempts from legacy media brands to get into the world of gaming when other mainstream entertainment organisations have tried to enter the game space theyve really struggled thompson says i think its often down to companies fundamentally misunderstanding what it is about games as a form of entertainment that make them so compelling to players amazon games is an example of this theyve had titles like lost ark and and crucible with big budgets but those titles lacked the creativity and uniqueness that weve come to expect from the games space thats a significant reason why those titles havent ended up making a serious impact experiences such as this and tech giant google who closed its stadia console this year show how difficult it is to find a place in the games space for companies amazons games division may not yet be as successful as its prime video operation however we still expect to see more titles from them in future the company is currently working on a the next iteration of the tomb raider franchise starring lara croft focusing on the mobile games first is a clever strategy that could work in netflix favour says thompson it looks as if theyre talking the time to understand the landscape and gamers i know their reputation has been a bit shaky on the streaming side recently but it certainly seems like theyre trying to work with the games space and not against it however giving gamers what they want not what a big organisations think they want will be the key to making this work that is creativity and being unique amazon have been making games like multiplayer experience new world since in future loombe says we can expect to see netflix leverage its intellectual property even more connecting shows movies and games together from our universes is what were trying to accomplish she explains in a trendy office space in central liverpool thats exactly what the team at ripstone studios are trying to do in amongst the exposed brick succulent plants and pop culture memorabilia littered on the desks are developers and programmers busy creating the next update for their first partnership with netflix the queens gambit is as you may have guessed a chess simulator based on the adventures of the television series main character beth harmon the team won the contract to make the game after jaime brayshaw the creative executive sent netflix an email out of the blue i asked them when will netflix become the netflix of games he laughs ripstone who have a long history of making chess games became one of the first companies to partner with the streaming giant to work on their games offering brayshaw says the relationship is not just a licensing agreement but rather a collaborative partnership with both companies sharing expertise with each other as well as offering more content to netflix customers in an increasingly competitive market brayshaw thinks their collaboration is a chance to help grow gaming as a form of entertainment as well netflix has an audience million people now he says many of them will never have played a game before so we had to think about designing one that is accessible to as many people as possible even if theyve never played a video game its exciting because it potentially allows more people to experience the joys of playing games and it could broaden the popularity of the medium netflix started offering games such as stranger things the game to subscribers in confident that this agreement is a win win brayshaw isnt worried about joining the long history of failed game and movie or television tie ins yes there are lots of bad examples from yesteryear with tie ins that are bad but its usually because there are timelines involved he argues netflix has a more mature approach where the products dont have to tie together at release so fewer compromises are needed the streamer will be keen to learn from the other big media organisations renowned for working in film television or tech whove tried to cross the divide into the games space googles cloud gaming service stadia was discontinued in january while amazons games division has developed its own titles with mixed success it is currently working on a new lara croft game but none of its releases so far have challenged the popularity of titles like fortnite or call of duty there were redundancies at the studio earlier this year by focusing on mobile titles which are cheaper to make than big console releases there is less financial risk for netflix it isnt investing millions in one experience that has to compete with well established brands to be deemed a success should a project fail to reach lots of players the financial ramifications are not as significant the queens gambit is the latest example of netflix leveraging its intellectual property in the gaming space however the other side of the coin is that in such a competitive space if players are not impressed with what theyre seeing if they feel it lacks scope or ambition they will very quickly move on to something else it can be difficult to regain an audience that has moved on to other games this bottom up approach is different to what weve seen before and we wont be able to judge its success for some time as loombe reiterates were very early in our games journey right now when its such a big industry like games and theres already some fantastic titles out there in the market that players really love we just want to make sure we were doing things in the right way nagorno karabakh people are fainting queuing up for bread nagorno karabakh conflict demonstrators rally to demand the reopening of a blockaded road linking the nagorno karabakh region to armenia in stepanakert july demonstrations have been taking place in nagorno karabakhs regional capital stepanakert demanding the reopening of a blockaded road linking the region to armenia by rayhan demytrie bbc south caucasus correspondent armenian border they call it the road of life as it is the only route connecting ethnic armenians living in azerbaijans nagorno karabakh region with the republic of

does not exist on the world map as this mountainous enclave is part of azerbaijans nagorno karabakh region despite having so much in common culturally the two south caucasus states of armenia and azerbaijan have fought for control of this land for decades in wars that have cost tens of thousands of lives in the most recent six week war in azerbaijan recaptured all the territories surrounding nagorno karabakh held by armenia since a ceasefire brokered by russia relied on the deployment of russian peacekeepers to guarantee the safety of ethnic armenians and to control the lachin corridor allowing for the free movement of people and goods between karabakh and the republic of armenia but with russias focus on the war in ukraine azerbaijan blocked the road to nagorno karabakhs regional capital stepanakert known in azerbaijan as khandendi with government backed environmental activists last december a map shows the location of the lachin corridor and the armenia azerbaijan border px transparent line in april azerbaijan installed its own military checkpoint at the entrance to the lachin corridor justifying its sovereign right and full restoration of its territorial integrity it accused armenia of using the road to bring in military supplies which armenia denies the only international humanitarian organisations with access to nagorno karabakh are the international committee of the red cross icrc and the mine clearance organisation the halo trust the halo trust says it has been unable to deploy demining teams in recent weeks because its staff are too exhausted to work after queuing for bread all night and returning home empty handed it says halting operations in martakert is particularly unfortunate as it has become a hub for people displaced by the war in and they are now at risk of injury as well as malnutrition although the red cross has been carrying out medical evacuations it has not been able to guarantee safe passage as the khachatryan family found out on july that was the day year old vagif khachatryan was being transported to armenias capital yerevan for urgent surgery for a heart condition when they approached the azerbaijani checkpoint they said they needed to take him for minutes to ask him a few questions says his daughter vera khachatryan my father was taken away with a red cross employee a few minutes later the red cross employee returned but my father was taken in an unknown direction originally from karabakh she moved to the armenian town of jermuk after her village was returned to azerbaijan as part of the ceasefire agreement now

lot of eyewitnesses who recognise him through media reports we never said war criminals shouldnt face justice says hikmet hajiyev special adviser to azerbaijans president ilham aliyev vera says the accusations are untrue defending your country is not a crime there cannot be a fair trial in azerbaijan maybe there will be justice one day but we dont have the time to wait for it vagif khachatryans case has sent a shock wave among men in nagorno karabakh three young karabakh armenian football players were detained this week at the same checkpoint for desecrating the azerbaijani flag in the fear now is that any ethnic armenian male could face the same fate if they try to cross veras two other sisters remain in karabakh under blockade my sisters granddaughter is two months old there is no baby

justice had already told azerbaijan it had a legally binding order to allow unimpeded movement of persons vehicles and cargo on the road in both directions but armenians are sceptical of the international communitys commitment to resolve the crisis protesters in yerevan have blocked the entrance to the un office with food and sacks of flour to demand the roads reopening soldiers stand by boxes filled with sunflower oil outside un offices in yerevan boxes of food items including sunflower oil pile up outside the un offices in yerevan azerbaijan denies a humanitarian crisis is unfolding it says it wants full control of the territory and has offered an alternative supply route via the town of agdam retaken during the war then afterwards the lachin road will be opened in hours as well more roads are better for everybody says the azerbaijani presidents special adviser hikmet hajiyev says karabakh armenians have been offered the same linguistic cultural religious including municipal rights as azerbaijani citizens but armenias ambassador at large edmon marukyan accuses azerbaijan of making false promises when there is only one route connecting armenia to nagorno karabakh they want to try and change the focus of the international community to dissolve the understanding and obligation of the lachin corridor former un special rapporteur gulnara shahinian warns that severing the last link with the republic of armenia will spell annihilation for karabakh armenians you know what level of human rights violations occur in azerbaijan with their entire hatred policy how could you

of migrant families streamed across the u s mexico border in august according to preliminary data obtained by the washington post an influx that has upended biden administration efforts to discourage parents from entering illegally with children and could once again place immigration in the spotlight during a presidential race sign up for fact checker our weekly review of whats true false or in between in politics the u s border patrol arrested at least migrants who crossed as part of a family group in august exceeding the prior one month record of set in may during the trump administration families were the single largest demographic group crossing the border in august surpassing single adults for the first time since biden took office overall the data show border apprehensions have risen more than percent for two consecutive months after falling sharply in may and june as the biden administration rolled out new restrictions and entry opportunities the border patrol made more than arrests along the mexico border in august up from in july and in june erin heeter a spokesperson for the department of homeland security said the biden administration is trying to slow illegal entries by expanding lawful options and also stiffening penalties the government ramped up deportation flights carrying families in august she said and since may has repatriated more than parents and children who recently crossed the border in a family group but as with every year the u s is seeing ebbs and flows of migrants arriving fueled by seasonal trends and the efforts of smugglers to use disinformation to prey on vulnerable migrants and encourage migration heeter said in a statement family groups have been an achilles heel for u s immigration enforcement for over a decade most migrants in that category who are detained by border patrol agents are quickly released and allowed to live and work in the united states while their humanitarian claims are pending backlogged u s immigration courts typically take several years to reach a decision and the process rarely ends in deportation federal data show coming amid peak summer heat the latest surge underscores the extent to which u s immigration enforcement has come full circle since trumps tenure when the department of homeland security faced an influx of families crossing from mexico and for several months tried taking children from their parents as a deterrent trump officials eventually reduced family crossings by aggressively expanding the remain in mexico program which sent thousands of asylum seekers back across the border to wait many in squalid conditions while their claims were adjudicated in u s courts when the pandemic hit in early trump used a provision of title the u s public health code to rapidly expel border crossers to their home countries or mexico without a chance to seek asylum u s customs and border protection carried out million expulsions including of families between march and may records show president biden who ran for office pledging more humane treatment for migrants halted remain in mexico and closed the three detention centers for families operated by u s immigration and customs enforcement biden has replaced the pandemic policy with new measures that allow tens of thousands more migrants to come to the united states legally each month but make it harder for those who cross illegally to get released after making an asylum claim the latest customs and border protection data show more than migrants were processed in august at u s border crossings where the biden administration is allowing up to per day to schedule an appointment to enter the country lawfully using a mobile app that increased the total number of migrants encountered by cbp at the southern

authorization to live and work in the united states for two years if they have a financial sponsor and clear background checks the program known as parole allows beneficiaries to fly to the united states instead of crossing at the border both programs are facing challenges in federal court from officials in republican led states illegal crossings by migrants from the parole eligible countries have fallen sharply but cbp records show major increases this summer in migration from guatemala honduras ecuador peru and an array of nations in asia and africa the arrival of thousands of parents with children in remote areas amid triple digit temperatures is a major humanitarian linguistic and logistical challenge the biden administration has expanded the border agencys network of climate controlled soft sided tent facilities with medical staff and social workers on hand to help care for children but many families still first encounter traditional cbp stations which have windowless grim detention cells with concrete benches and were designed as short term holding facilities for adults blas nu ez neto the biden administrations top border policy official said in a federal court filing last week that bipartisan efforts to control the border helped reduce illegal crossings from more than million a year decades ago to fewer than a year on average from to but partisan gridlock has intensified and the demographic makeup of migrants has changed officials saw a marked increase in families and unaccompanied minors arriving at the southern border some have been targeted by violence in their home countries that could make them eligible for humanitarian programs but others are relying on promises from smugglers who tell them families are far less likely to be deported the august tally brings the total number of family member units surrendering at the southern border during the current fiscal year to more than half a million people a record with one more month to count the biden administration has sent mixed messages about targeting families for deportation during his first year in office biden pledged to reunite the families trump had separated and to protect undocumented families already living inside the united states in biden administration officials ended family immigration detention and declared schools and places where children gather off limits for immigration enforcement officials said they would not detain or deport women who are pregnant or breastfeeding but officials said they would continue to deport families who had recently crossed the border worried that if they didnt their numbers would overwhelm border patrol facilities in recent months biden administration officials have held news conferences with spanish language media and published footage of deportation flights carrying children to discourage families from attempting to cross border crossings down but many migrants released to u s to avoid crowding the biden administration also has created enforcement programs targeting families in department of homeland security and justice department officials created a dedicated immigration court docket in cities to adjudicate family cases within days of the initial hearing the expedited system which is not for all families is much faster than the usual time for the backlogged immigration courts the program operates in boston denver detroit el paso los angeles miami newark new york san diego san francisco and seattle advocates for immigrants say the system is unfair because thousands of migrants have been unable to find lawyers and it is unclear how families are assigned to the faster docket in may biden officials launched the family expedited removal management program or ferm which places some

speaks at a news conference wednesday in perry fla in the aftermath of hurricane idalia desantis as a republican and a floridian is not unique in his relationship to federal disaster spending john raoux ap photo ron desantis had just been sworn in as a member of the house in when he voted against sending billion in disaster relief to new york and new jersey two states still reeling from the damage of hurricane sandy i sympathize with the victims the florida republican said at the time but objected to what he called congress put it on the credit card mentality when it came to government spending now a day after hurricane idalia pummeled florida less than a year since hurricane ians destruction desantis is not objecting to federal borrowing when itll help his disaster stricken state as floridas governor and a white house contender he is in regular contact with president joe biden as the state seeks dollars from washington to rebuild from the storm wreckage assist rescue efforts and aid displaced residents desantis hurricane search and rescue to begin as soon as its safe shareplay video this is part of a tradition florida republicans have a history of supporting government assistance for their states natural disasters while frequently rejecting broader packages designed to lessen the impact of these emergencies torn between their constituents priorities and their partys position on reining in the federal debt desantis vote a decade ago was based on his opposition to the sandy packages additional pork spending a spokesperson for his presidential campaign said thursday florida gop lawmakers in both chambers frequently release similar statements after voting against disaster money citing the countrys sky high deficit as the determining factor but one florida republican calls that position increasingly untenable in a state that so frequently finds itself at ground zero for catastrophic hurricanes just one of the litany of disasters that scientists expect to become worse as the planet warms its always understandable why people in theory would vote against federal aid when it doesnt affect them said carlos curbelo a former miami area gop member of congress but when you live in florida that position is unsustainable desantis probably regrets taking that vote on sandy he added he is now in a position of requesting federal aid for hurricane relief for the second year in a row and these are major asks these are billions upon billions of dollars carlos curbelo its always understandable why people in theory would vote against federal aid when it doesnt affect them said carlos curbelo a former gop member of congress but when you live in florida that position is unsustainable alex wong getty images its been almost years since then new york republican rep peter king dared his gop colleagues to meet their moral obligation to help natural disaster torn communities a plea that house republicans including desantis ultimately rejected but desantis as a republican and a floridian is not unique in his relationship to federal disaster spending the states congressional delegation has a history of idiosyncratic voting patterns on legislation that would seek to respond to or mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events that are direct results of the worsening climate crisis gop senators weigh special meeting on their leadership after mcconnells freeze feinstein is a silent character in her sad and messy final chapter why is nobody doing anything about mitch mcconnell slightly higher times biden administration moves to loosen weed restrictions desantis voted against sandy aid a decade ago now his state needs the help republicans from florida have repeatedly voted to send federal disaster relief to their own state at times vocally pushing for it sen rick scott r fla for instance has said he will demand an immediate vote next week on a bill to refill the federal emergency management agencys coffers i will not allow washington to continue playing games with disaster aid and the lives of those needing our help scott said in a statement more broadly florida republicans in congress have for the last decade largely toed the party line on climate politics refusing to support legislation that could be perceived as hostile to the oil and gas industry while embracing measures that would help their state in more immediate and tangible ways respond to climate change curbelo predicts it will soon become harder for florida republicans to cherry pick what they are willing to accept and sacrifice while florida has always experienced dangerous hurricanes he said it has become especially vulnerable to violent storms sea level rise coastal erosion and heat waves the state is under a lot of stress in terms of insurance issues said curbelo who spent his two terms in congress working to push his party to acknowledge the climate crisis markets are not forgiving they expose risk and weakness with every storm with every major flooding event the pressure on florida members to support a broad climate policy agenda is going to grow lost bipartisan tradition the fight over sandy funding marked a shift in the debate over what responsibility members of congress owe one another when faced with natural disasters as lawmakers were preparing to adjourn the th congress in the first days of january after an extended legislative session to address the fiscal cliff house gop leaders abruptly canceled a vote on sandy aid amid outcry from conservatives who didnt want to spend more government money after king and other republicans revolted and shamed their leadership a vote was convened swiftly upon reconvening for the th congress on jan the relief bill was passed all but three florida republicans voted no on the grounds it spent too much money also desantis argument at that time jeremy redfern a desantis press secretary told politicos e e news that we have no time for politics or pettiness when asked if the governor wishes he had voted differently in as a member of congress desantis supported emergency disaster relief funding for hurricane sandy but he did not support the additional pork spending that ended up in the final relief bill bryan griffin press secretary for desantis presidential campaign added in a separate statement republicans at the time complained that the sandy package continued to fund a depleted national flood insurance program with money the government didnt have as governor griffin said desantis will of course marshal all available resources state and federal to aid those in need during recovery dan weiss a veteran climate advocate observed that sandy was the turning point in what came next for how congressional republicans have since approached disaster relief funding votes it used to be extremely bipartisan like so many other things involving money he said peter king came from the bipartisan tradition of providing disaster relief to states based on need florida republicans have by and large gone on to support sending money to avert weather catastrophes but typically only if their own state was included and only as stand alone propositions not as part of larger spending packages the states house gop delegation for example unanimously supported an billion disaster aid package in december to help florida texas puerto rico the u s virgin islands and california rebuild after a series of natural disasters that year including hurricanes irma harvey and maria but the delegation split in february when that disaster money was folded into a larger government spending bill then president donald trump eventually signed into law at that point five florida republicans in the house voted against the bill while supported it siding with sen marco rubio r fla and then florida democratic sen bill nelson in the other chamber in all but two florida republicans in the house backed legislation that would among other things mitigate the damage done to their state from hurricane michael in the senate rubio and scott who had by then unseated nelson voted yes too then came hurricane ian in congress included language in the bill allowing fema to tap billion to respond to a slew of natural disasters including ian every florida republican in the house voted against it scott opposed it in the senate rubio didnt vote looming political liability florida republicans have rallied around other policies to protect their states specific environmental interests they have continued a time honored tradition of joining with democrats to oppose oil drilling in their states portion of the gulf of mexico an activity some of them argue could hamper activities at nearby military bases and which all of them see as a risk to the peace health and safety of florida communities but theyve also criticized the biden administrations efforts to limit the practice in other states gop members of the florida congressional delegation have also typically supported major federal investments to restore the everglades the largest subtropical wilderness in the united states at the same time they have not fought back against specific development and mining projects in the area that the environmental protection agency and florida conservation groups say could threaten endangered species and fragile ecosystems ultimately said league of conservation voters vice president of political affairs craig auster these positions wont make a difference if congress isnt supporting policies to drive down greenhouse gas emissions were not going to protect florida coastal communities and were not going to protect the everglades if we arent addressing climate change auster said because climate change is the biggest threat to both of those things hurricane idalia a canopy lies wrapped around a tree in an rv park in mayo fla after the passage of hurricane idalia on wednesday rebecca blackwell ap photo there have been some occasions since when florida republicans in congress engaged with democrats on legislation that would have made targeted long lasting contributions to disaster preparedness and resiliency in the house passed the reforming disaster recovery act which would have required that all post disaster rebuilding projects funded by certain federal dollars comply with the newest construction codes which account for the realities of climate change elevating buildings and designing structures to withstand intense winds for instance the measure advanced in a vote with five of the republicans favoring it hailing from the florida delegation but it has since languished after the senate failed to take it up yet in the fall of the obama administration got little gop buy in when it established the task force on climate preparedness and resilience to advise on how the federal government could respond to the needs of communities at the forefront of the climate crisis supporters had hoped republicans would get involved but not a single gop federal or statewide elected official joined not even then new jersey gov chris christie weiss noted even though his state suffered extensive damage due to superstorm sandy auster the league of conservation voters vice president sided with curbelo for florida republicans and desantis its going to become harder to stay on the sidelines its all well and good to say the government shouldnt be fighting climate change until your big insurance companies are going to stop providing insurance for unsafe places and if people cant get help when their homes are destroyed and when people are losing their lives to wildfires and floods and hurricanes auster said reporters ariel wittenberg and robin bravender contributed to this report
