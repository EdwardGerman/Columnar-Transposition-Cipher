stalks away stay speak speak i charge thee speak exit ghost tis gone and will not answer how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on t before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch testimony of mine own eyes is it not like the king as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway king of norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle parley he smote the sledded polacks on the ice smote ice struck his poleax long handled battle axe on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour jump hour at this very same hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch martial stalk the walk of a warrior in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion in opinion overall i think this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me why this inform me why are we keeping this nightly watch up here on the castle why are our artisans hard at work every day making cannons why is our country so busy buying weapons of war and why are we hiring so many men to build ships why is everyone working in such a sweat day and night who can tell me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king king hamlet whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride prickd pride goaded on by a most ambitious pride dard to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seizd of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent reasonable portion was gaged pledged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes sharkd resolutes recruited hoodlums for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsative those foresaid lands terms compulsative terms forced on elsinore so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and romage heightened activity in the land i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure the ghost comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote speck it is to trouble the minds eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere before the mightiest julius julius caesar fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star moon upon whose influence neptunes empire stands upon stands the seas make up the empire of neptune the god of the sea in roman mythology the ebb and flow of the tides depend on the gravitational pull of the moon was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen and even countrymen denmark is experiencing the same kind of ill omens that preceded caesars assassination but soft soft pay attention stand at attention take note behold lo where it comes again re enter ghost ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy countrys fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded hoarded stored up in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death cock crows speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan long shafted weapon mounted with a blade do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew crowed and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies runs off to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation proof it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning rooster singeth all night long and then they say no spirit can walk abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastern hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen to night unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty lets do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt exeunt is a stage direction indicating act scene a room of state in the castle enter the king queen hamlet polonius laertes voltimand cornelius lords and attendants thought yet of hamlet our dear brothers death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress of this war like state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal supposition assumption of our worth or thinking by our late dear brothers death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued coupled joined with the dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bands of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephews purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated outlined articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltimand and cornelius and now laertes whats the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord dread my lord dreaded lord esteemed lord great lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your fathers leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seald my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind in an aside a character lowers his voice or whispers so that another character or other characters onstage cannot hear him sometimes the speaker of an aside allows a friend or someone else near him to hear the aside how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun i am sun a pun hamlet is subtly intimating that he does not like being the son or stepson of claudius good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father old hamlet in the dust thou knowst tis common all that live must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forcd breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour appearance of the visage together with all forms modes shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show but show no one can see what i am thinking or feeling these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement mourning is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse corpse till he that died to day this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde contrary to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforcd accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks to day but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the kings rouse the heavens shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away no jocund thunder the great cannon shall boom to the skies while i drink a toast that heaven itself shall hear resound again and again echoing like earthly thunder exeunt all except hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fixd his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god or that slaughter or that god had not forbade suicide how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t o fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother hyperion father of helios the sun god in greek mythology satyr in greek mythology a lecherous goatlike man that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followd my poor fathers body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mournd longer married with mine uncle my fathers brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and bernardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend ill change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you to bernardo good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant lazy idle disposition good my lord my good lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do mine ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore well teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your fathers funeral i pray thee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mothers wedding indeed my lord it followd hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bakd meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables the funeral bakd tables the marriage took place so soon after the death of old hamlet that food from the funeral was served at the wedding reception would i had met my dearest foe in heaven ere before i had ever seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father o where my lord in my minds eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent attentive ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for gods love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounterd a figure like your father armed at points exactly cap a pe variant spelling of cap a pie meaning from head to toe appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd by their oppressd and fear surprised eyes within his truncheons length whilst they distilld truncheons length the apparition was no farther from them than the length of a truncheon a staff symbolizing a kings authority almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliverd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform floor surrounded by battlements where we watchd did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew crowed loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanishd from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honourd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch to night marcellus and we do my lord armd say you marcellus and armd my lord from top to toe marcellus and my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up beaver shield on the helmet of a suit of armor the beaver protects the face it can be raised on hinges what lookd he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fixd his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amazd you very like very like stayd it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw it his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silverd black beard with silver hairs i will watch to night perchance twill walk again i warrant it will if it assume my noble fathers person ill speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceald this sight let it be tenable in your silence still let still dont tell anyone about it and whatsoever else shall hap happen to night give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare you well requite loves pay you back upon the platform twixt between eleven and twelve ill visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and bernardo my fathers spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes exit act scene a room in the house of polonius enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries packed belongings are embarkd farewell and sister as the winds give benefit as benefit as the winds fill the sails of my ship and convoy is assistant do not sleep convoy assistant if letter carriers are available but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood for blood regard hamlet as a passing fancy a violet in the youth of primy in its prime nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance appeal of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent growing does not grow alone in thews strength and bulk but as this temple waxes temple waxes body grows the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal in addition besides perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel deceit doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalud persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and the health of the whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribd unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent believing ear you list listen to his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmasterd importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection keep you affection restrain yourself out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest wariest most cautious maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue herself scapes not calumnious strokes virtue strokes even the virtuous are victims of gossip the canker worm disease galls the infants plants of the spring too oft before their buttons buds be disclosd and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent contagious blastments sexual advances be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near youth rebels young people tend to succumb to temptation i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede recks rede takes not his own advice o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayd waited for there my blessing with thee and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue character used as a verb to mean etch in your mind nor any unproportiond bad ill suited thought his act be thou familiar friendly but by no means vulgar the friends thou hast and their adoption tried tested grapple hold seize them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatchd unfledgd comrade beware do not comrade do not greet or shake hands with every untested person of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each mans censure opinion or criticism but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy costly buy thy dress should be only as costly as you can afford but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry management of money this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lockd and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience attention to hamlet been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves behooves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green naive girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry ill teach you think yourself a baby that you have taen these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus youll tender me a fool my lord he hath importund me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance good behavior to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes traps to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct no longer active no longer burning in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be somewhat scanter of unavailable in your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether larger tether more freedom may he walk than may be given you in few a few words ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moments leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt act scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake to night and takes his rouse the king rouse the king stays awake tonight and takes his liquor keeps wassail a toast to good health and the swaggering up spring reels fast dances and as he drains his draughts of rhenish german wine down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honourd in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traducd humiliated and taxd of other nations they clepe call us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition honor reputation and indeed it takes from our achievements though performd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the oergrowth of some complexion characteristic or trait oft breaking down the pales boundaries and forts of reason or by some habit that too much oer leavens the form of plausive reasonable acceptable agreeable manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or fortunes star their virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure opinion take corruption from that particular fault the dram of eale ale or evil doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal enter ghost look my lord it comes angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comst in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canonizd saintly given the approved burial rites bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements burial garment or garments why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse corpse again in complete steel armor revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do the ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment message secret did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pins fee meager value and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again ill follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles oer projects over his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on ill follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be ruld you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lions

almost come when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames must render up myself alas poor ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold speak i am bound to hear so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear what i am thy fathers spirit doomd for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confind to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purgd away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine porcupine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list listen list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love o god revenge his foul and most unnatural murder murder murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural haste me to know t that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf lethe in greek mythology the river of forgetfulness in hades wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in mine orchard a serpent stung me so the

incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be movd though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven lewdness heaven the ghost says claudius was lewd but pretended to be upright so lust

doth posset curdle coagulate and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter skin eruption barkd about most lazar like leprous with vile

farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia whats the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet closefitting sleeveless jacket all unbracd no hat upon his head his stockings fould ungarterd and down gyved lowered to a position like that of a legiron gyve on a prisoner to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raisd a sigh so piteous and profound that it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted studied closely him i feard he did but trifle and meant to wrack ruin ravish thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love come exeunt act scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlets transformation so i call it since nor the exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it

neighbourd to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe put place your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean wher aught to us unknown afflicts him thus wher him whether anything unknown to us afflicts him that opend lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a kings remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty but we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i

liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath usd to do that i have found the very cause of hamlets lunacy o speak of that that do i long to hear give first admittance to the ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your sons distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his fathers death and our oerhasty marriage well we shall

sent out to suppress his nephews levies recruitment of men into the army which to him appeard to be a preparation gainst the polack pole but better lookd into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grievd that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms against your majesty to give arms to make war whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack pole with an entreaty herein further shown giving a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions

for your well took labour go to your rest at night well feast together most welcome home exeunt voltimand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art more art give specific details but avoid being wordy madam i swear i use no art embellishment wordiness at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend be attentive consider carefully what i say i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this letter note now gather and surmise figure out its meaning polonius reads from the letter to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified ophelia thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus in her excellent white bosom these c etc came this from hamlet to her good madam stay awhile i will be faithful doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers verses lines of poetry i have not art to reckon express my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu farewell thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him machine him body is mine hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receivd his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain willingly prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceivd it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work i would fain round to work i would willingly prove so but what would you think when i saw their relationship developing if i had helped them by leaving love letters on a desk or placing them between the pages of a book left on a table what would you think if stood idly by without taking action the fact is i did take action i went to work against allowing this relationship to continue and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time id fain happily gladly know that that i have positively said tis so when it provd otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise pointing to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre center of the earth how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time ill loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras curtain tapestry then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fallen thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters drivers of carts we will try it but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away ill board confront him presently exeunt king queen and attendants enter hamlet reading o give me leave how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you are a fishmonger fish merchant not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand thats very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter hamlet is now pretending to be mad i have my lord let her not walk i the sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t aside how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this ill speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging oozing thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams knees all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is method in t end of aside will you walk out of the air my lord though method in t though he is mad there is an intelligent design in his actions into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant clever meaningful sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter end of aside my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord going these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius mine honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent moderately well children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortunes cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates genital organs we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet promiscuous woman what news none my lord but that the worlds grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmarks a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst ros we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we to the court for by my fay faith i cannot reason and well wait upon you no such matter i will not count you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny english coin of small value were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure appeal to you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy agreeableness of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no aside to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult shed no feather i have of late but wherefore why i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament sky this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form in moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence perfection of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted passed them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target rapier and shield the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man actor who can play different parts character actor shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o the sere burst out laughing at the slightest provocation a sere is a hair trigger and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse see the study guide section on blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take delight in tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways their ways they were more popular and made more money when in residence in a city i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation i think innovation i think they were prohibited after a recent riot do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted desired pace but there is sir an aery nest group of children little eyases falcons in training that cry out on the top of the question top of their voices and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted paid will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession if they succession if they continue to act after they become adults they will no longer be a novelty faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre goad them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for the argument plot of a play unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is it possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too hercules too the image of the mythological hero hercules bearing the world on his shoulders was a symbol of the globe theatre it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mows frowns at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats a piece for his picture in little small image of the king sblood by the blood of the crucified christ there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then let me shake your hands the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb regard lest my extent behavior to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw heronshaw a type of wading bird i know handsaw i know whats what enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts clothes happily hes the second time come wearing to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it hamlet turns his attention to polonius you say right sir o monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell you when roscius renowned actor was an actor in rome the actors are come hither my lord buzz buzz buzz means old news it is also the equivalent of zzzzzzz to suggest sleeping in other words hamlet thinks he is about to be bored or put to sleep so to speak by what polonius says upon my honour then came each actor on his ass the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral comical historical pastoral tragical historical tragical comical historical pastoral scene individable scene that preserves the classical unities of time place and action or poem unlimited seneca ancient roman tragedian cannot be too heavy nor plautus ancient roman writer of comedies too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou what a treasure had he my lord why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well aside still on my daughter hamlets reference to jephthahs daughter leads polonius to conclude that hamlet is thinking about ophelia am i not i the right old jephthah if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well nay that follows not what follows then my lord why as by lot god wot knew and then you know it came to pass as most like it was the first row of the pious chanson pious poem or song will show you more for look where my abridgment comes abridgement this word may mean entertainment it may also mean that the players abridge that is cut off or shorten hamlets conversation with polonius enter four or five players you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend thy face is valanced bearded since i saw thee last comest thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by r lady by the blessed virgin mary your ladyship boy who plays womens parts is nearer heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine shoe with a thick sole pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold gold coin be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome well een to t take to it like french falconers fly at anything we see well have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my good lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above more than once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviar to the general the general public did not appreciate caviar but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets salads or delicious treats in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arm black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse trojan horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules red horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bakd and impasted encrusted with the residue of the burning city of troy with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus oer sized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles red gems the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon soon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matchd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium troy seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack clouds stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forgd for proof impenetrability eterne eternal with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies parts of a rim from her wheel and bowl the round nave wheel hub down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends this is too long it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee i pray you say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry dirty story or he sleeps becomes bored say on come to hecuba first but who o who had seen the mobled wrapped up enshrouded queen the mobled queen thats good mobled queen is good first run barefoot up and down threatning the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head bisson rheum blinding bisson discharge rheum from

this had seen with tongue in venom steepd gainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncd who pronouncd anyone who had seen hecuba in this sorry state would have condemned lady fortune for her cruelty but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch teary the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look wher whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in s eyes prithee no more tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert gods bodikins by the body of the lord man much better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends well hear a

could force his soul to make his face appear pale tears in his eyes distraction wild excitement in his aspect the way he looks a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave pierce the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy

remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion lowly kitchen servant fie upon t foh exclamation of disgust about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions sins misdeeds for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent probe him to the quick raw flesh beneath the skin if he but blench flinch i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me ill have grounds more relative than this the plays the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king exit act scene a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance clue hint get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward eager to be sounded questioned but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition forcing disposition forcing himself to be polite and pleasant niggard stingy spare of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime assay to ask him about madam it so fell out that certain players we oer raught overtook on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclind good lemen gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront confront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials concerned observers will so bestow hide ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behavd if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for you ophelia i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted desired normal way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much provd that with devotions visage pious appearance and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word the harlots word the prostitutes cheek plastered with makeup is no more ugly than my devious actions and false words o heavy burden i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to be or not wishd to go on living or end my life that is the question is it nobler to suffer the pain of misfortune or to take action against this pain death brings eternal sleep which supposedly ends suffering that is an outcome to be wished for to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub obstacle problem for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of disprizd love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of to sleep not of the dreams we might have in the sleep of death in fact all that happens in the afterlife is a very intimidating subject for this reason people generally choose to live on rather than ending their lives in spite of the severity of the troubles they face i dont think any person would bear lifes problems scorn oppression insolence love gone wrong injustice the arrogance of the high and mighty rejection if he could end his life without fear of what would happen next in the afterlife but the afterlife is an undiscovered country from whose boundaries no one returns so rather than commit suicide and confront the unknown we choose to stay alive and bear our burdens thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons prayers be all my sins rememberd good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught anything my honourd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composd as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest chaste my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty chastity from what it is to a bawd prostitute whore than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love thee once for the power likeness beautiful women tend to give in to lust rather than remain chaste indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not virtue it we may admire virtue but we ourselves are anything but virtuous i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent somewhat honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between heaven and earth we are arrant complete knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters fools cuckolds you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell o heavenly powers restore him i have heard of your paintings applications of makeup to her face too well enough god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig dance suggestively you amble and you lisp speak affectedly speak in a way designed to impress others and nickname gods creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to ill no more on t it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go exit nickname ignorance you give lewd names to gods creatures but pretend you dont know what they mean o what a noble mind is here oerthrown the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword he has been an example for courtiers soldiers and scholars to imitate the expectancy hope and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observd of all observers quite quite down and i of ladies most deject and wretched that suckd the honey of his music vows sweet words now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatchd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see re enter king and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood sits on a scheme or plot as a hen sits on eggs and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute he shall tribute i will send him to england on the pretense that he is to collect money owed to denmark haply perhaps the seas and countries different with variable objects sights shall expel this something settled matter in his heart the malady that has settled in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t puts him of himself makes him act abnormally it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his griefs let her be round with him and ill be placd so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not and ill conference and i will hide then eavesdrop on their conversation to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go exeunt act scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand do not overdo your gestures thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings actor in a powdered wig who shouts his lines to the uneducated commoners who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oer doing termagant noisy overbearing shrewish woman it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant promise your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reformed that indifferently moderately with us o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work and the queen too and that presently bid the players make haste exit polonius will you two help to hasten them and we will my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern what ho

heart of heart as i do thee something too much of this im dwelling too much on this subject there is a play to night before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my fathers death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment eye of thy soul observe mine uncle if his occulted concealed guilt do not itself unkennel reveal itself in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcans stithy the smithy of vulcan the blacksmith god in roman mythology give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure analysis of his seeming reaction behavior well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and scape detecting i

cannot feed capons so how fares capons so claudius asks how hamlet is getting along but hamlet pretends that he interprets fares to mean eats he then says he eats what the chameleon eats air it was believed that chameleons fed on air however because the air is fat with promise but empty of actual benefit says hamlet one cannot feed air to capons castrated male chickens hamlet is like a chameleon in that he changes colors that is he becomes a different person in front of claudius however in his effort to nail claudius as the murderer of his father hamlet so far has come up only with air but no substance i have nothing with i do not understand this answer hamlet these words are not mine no nor mine now to polonius my lord you played once i the university you say that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor and what did you enact i did enact julius c sar i was killed i the capitol brutus killed me it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there be the players ready ay my

lap lying down at ophelias feet no my lord i mean my head upon your lap ay my lord do you think i meant country matters something indecent i think nothing my lord thats a fair thought to lie between maids legs thats legs after ophelia says she thinks nothing hamlet interprets nothing to mean the numerical symbol because of its shape this symbol was sometimes used as a representation of the vulva the external part of the female sex organ what is my lord nothing you are merry my lord who i ay my lord o god your only jig maker o god who is the original merrymaker what should a man do but be merry for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died withins two hours nay tis twice two months my lord so long nay then let the devil wear black for ill have a suit of sables since it

called the morris a participant wore a costume resembling a hobby horse during the dance the hobby horse died then later rose again and continued the dance like the hobby horse old king hamlet died

meant ay or any show that youll show him be not you ashamed to show hell not shame to tell you what it means you are naught you are naught ill mark the play for us and for our tragedy here stooping to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently is this a prologue or the posy of a ring brief poetry inscribed on a ring tis brief my lord as womans love enter two players king and queen player full thirty times hath phoebus cart the sun gone round neptunes salt wash ocean and tellus orbed ground tellus earth goddess in roman mythology and thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been since love our hearts and hymen god of marriage in greek mythology did our hands unite commutual together in most sacred bands player so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count oer ere love be done but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust am worried about you yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must i must not discomfort you for womens fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is sizd my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there player faith i must leave thee i must die love and shortly too my operant powers

be treason in my breast it would be treasonous to remarry in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who killd the first aside wormwood wormwood extremely bitter herb used in making absinthe and other alcoholic drinks player the instances that second marriage move the reasons to marry a second time are base respects of thrift financial or social gain but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed player i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break i do break i believe you are sincere about what you vow to do but people often change their minds and break their vows purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be which be unripe fruit remains on the tree ripe fruit falls most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose what to lose in a moment of passion we promise to do such and such but when the passion subsides we forget about our promise the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures actions with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye for aye forever nor tis not strange that even our love should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove wher whether love lead fortune or else fortune fortune lead love whether love leads to good luck or good luck leads to love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the great flies when a great man suffers a downfall notice that his favorite friends abandon him the poor advancd makes friends of enemies the poor enemies when the poor and downtrodden advance they become friends with enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend and tend in the same way success or failure at love may depend on whether a persons fortune is good or bad for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy for who enemy whoever has everything whoever has no needs will never lack a friend but whoever has needs and asks a friend for help will make of that friend an enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead but orderly dead but let me end where i began what we say we want and what fate gives us are often at odds you think that you will not remarry after i die but that thought will die when i die player nor earth to me give food nor heaven light sport and repose lock from me day and night to desperation turn my trust and hope an anchors cheer in prison be my scope each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife nor earth wife if i were to remarry i would deserve no food no heavenly light no rest all my trust and hope would dissolve into desperation the only fit place for me would be a prison with only a hermit monks an anchors cheer to keep me company i would want the opposite of joy i would wish for the destruction of joy if she should break it now what if she breaks her promises player tis deeply sworn i believe you are sincere sweet leave me here awhile my spirits grow dull and

it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty we majesty we stand ready we believe we have a moral duty to protect everyone who depends on you the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many the cease of majesty dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw whats near it with it it is a massy wheel fixd on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortisd and adjoind which when it falls each small annexment petty consequence attends the boisterous ruin the single ruin a person fiercely protects himself from danger but he is even more fierce when it comes to protecting a ruler such as you upon whom so many lives depend when a monarch falls to ruin he draws down with him like a whirlpool all that is around him another way of putting it is to say that he is like a giant wheel to which is attached his entire kingdom and its people when it rolls down a hill the whole kingdom rolls with it never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put upon this fear which now goes too free footed rosencrantz and we will haste us exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern enter polonius my lord hes going to his mothers closet

rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse the curse on the biblical cain for killing abel upon t a brothers murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brothers blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence whereto offence isnt mercy supposed to bestow itself on the face of the offender and whats in prayer but this two fold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardond being down then ill look up and whats down prayer has a twofold purpose to prevent us from sinning and to pardon us when we do sin my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardond and retain the offence in the corrupted currents of this world offences gilded hand may shove by justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but tis not so above in the above in this corrupt world a criminal can buy a pardon with his wicked prize of gold but he cant buy off heaven there is no shuffling

examples of others urge me on witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffd makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an egg shell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honours at the stake how stand i then witness at the stake the delicate prince who leads this huge army is not delaying his mission he is ready to risk his life even over a paltry matter true greatness in a man is not measured by whether he will fight over a major issue but by whether he will fight over a minor issue when his honor is at stake that have a father killd a mother staind excitements of my reason

now your conscience must find me innocent in the death of your father and you must put me in your heart for friend sith since you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursud my life it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats why feats why you did not punish hamlet for his actions so crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirrd up o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd weak but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive attached to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count trial i might not go is the great love the general gender citizens bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves shackles to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come whose revenge whose worth if i may look back to it in better times challenged anyone to find a woman who was as perfect as she was but i will have my revenge break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more break pastime dont lose any sleep over how to deal with hamlet i am not so passive that i can pass off danger as a game youll hear more about this later i lovd your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine enter a messenger how now what news letters my lord from hamlet

character handwriting naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me im lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus diddest thou you committed this terrible crime if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruld by me as me and why shouldnt it be so will you take my advice ay my lord so you will not oer rule me to a peace so peace as long as you dont advise me to make peace to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means as voyage deciding to end his voyage no more to undertake it i will work maneuver him to an exploit now ripe in my device ready to execute under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice uncharge the practice see no foul play and call it accident my lord i will be ruld the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ i will organ i will go along with your plan especially if you make me the instrument of hamlets death it falls right you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege you have siege you have been much talked about within the hearing of hamlet for an excellent quality of yours in hamlets eyes that quality overshadows all of your other qualities he envies it i myself think that quality is not your best what part quality is that my lord a very riband in the cap of youth riband ribbon used as a decoration or displayed as a reward of achievement yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness for graveness light and careless clothes are just as appropriate on youth as dignified sables and other dark clothes are on aged persons to reflect their health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy part of france ive seen myself and servd against the french and they can well can do well on horseback but this gallant norman had witchcraft in t in his horsemanship he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as he had been incorpsd and demi naturd with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did as he did as if he had become part of the brave beast he performed on that horse far beyond my expectations for him and i could never duplicate his feats a norman was t a norman upon my life lamond the very same i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers fencers swordsmen of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposd them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him now out of this what out of this my lord laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart why ask you this not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer but ulcer but to get to the point of whats eating at you hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words to cut his throat i the church no place indeed should murder sanctuarize no sanctuarize indeed a murderer such as hamlet should be fair game even in the sanctuary of a church revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence well excellence well have people praise your excellent swordsmanship and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine short together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse examine the foils practice swords blunted on the end so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated sharp not blunted and in a pass of practice practice lunge requite kill him for your father i will do t and for that purpose ill anoint poison the tip of my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm remedy poultice so rare collected from all simples medicines that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance our performance our purpose to kill hamlet casts suspicion on us twere better not assayd tried therefore this project should have a back backup plan or second that might hold if this should blast in proof fail soft pay attention stand at attention take note let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings well have bets on the outcome of the fencing match i ha t when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink ill have prepard him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomd stuck our purpose may hold there but stay what noise when in there during the match dance around so that hamlet does the same when both of you become sweaty and thirsty i will have a chalice with a poisoned drink ready to give him if he escapes unscathed from the fencing the drink will kill him enter queen how now sweet queen one woe doth tread upon anothers heel so fast they follow your sisters drownd laertes drownd o

and degrading uses the bodies of human beings are subjected to after death one can imagine that the ashes of alexander ended up as a stopper in the hole of a cask or a barrel twere to consider too curiously to consider so youre being cynical no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough without exaggerating and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel imperious c sar dead and turnd to clay might stop

be buried in unsanctified ground elsewhere till the end of time instead of praying for her people should throw pieces of broken pottery flint quartz and pebbles on her body however she is allowed flowers and wreaths crants indicating she died a virgin as well as the tolling of a bell and burial in sanctified ground must there no more be done first no more be done we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peace parted souls such souls other rites normally carried out for those deserving burial in consecrated ground lay her i the earth and from

see till then in patience our proceeding be exeunt act scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and horatio so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance remember it my lord sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines mutineers in the bilboes rashly bilboes a bilbo is a bar with fetters that are attached to the feet of prisoner and praisd be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometimes serves us well when our deep plots do pall fail and that should teach us theres a divinty that shapes god shapes our ends rough hew them how we will that is most certain up from my cabin my sea gown heavy coat with a high collar scarfd wrapped about me in the dark gropd i to find out them had my desire fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew gropd packet i groped around and found the packet containing the message to the king of england to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio o royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmarks health and englands too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off an exact struck off an exact command interspersed with niceties and greetings from our king to the english king that i was to be beheaded without delay upon my arrival in england is t possible heres the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed i beseech you being thus be netted ensnared round with villanies villainies ere i could make a prologue to my brains ere brains before i could think over what to do next they had begun the play i sat me down devisd a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists statesmen do a baseness to write fair and labourd much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeomans service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote ay good my lord an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm should flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many such like ases plural of as of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowd an earnest allowd i started with a statement from claudius that england was faithful to denmark and that love between the two countries should further flourish in a peaceful relationship with peace joining the two countries as a comma joins clauses and phrases then i added many other other sentences and clauses beginning with as and ended with a command to put the bearers of the message to death immediately even before they had time to confess their sins to god through a priest how was this seald why even in that was heaven ordinant helpful giving me guidance i had my fathers signet ring with a seal used as a stamp to endorse or authenticate documents in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribd it gave t th impression stamp placd it safely the changeling substituted document never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent what sequent what followed thou knowst already so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to t go to their death why man they did make love to this employment they employment they relished the idea of taking me to england to die they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites they are opposites their fate does not bother my conscience their downfall resulted from their own wilfull interference in my affairs its dangerous for lesser mortals like them to become involved in conflicts between opponents holding high positions in the realm why what a king claudius is this horatio is really saying why what an evil king is this does it not thinks t thee stand me now upon he that hath killd my king and whord my mother poppd in between the election and my hopes deprived me of being elected king thrown out his angle for my proper life hath given the order to kill me and with such cozenage deceit is t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is t not to be damnd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil is t not evil is it not perfectly justified to kill him with this sword and would i not be damned for allowing this evil man to live to commit more evil it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there it must there he will soon find out what happened in england it will be short the interim is mine and a mans lifes no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his ill count his favours but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion it will passion it wont be long before he finds out but ill have time to act in the interim i must say horatio that i am sorry i lost my temper when i confronted laertes at the grave site he too suffered great loss ill try to be cordial with him it was just that his outward display of grief rankled me peace who comes here enter osric osric is a courtier one who is a fixture at the court of a monarch a typical courtier was at the service of the ruler and often flattered him to gain favors and improve his standing at court your lordship is right welcome back to denmark i humbly thank you sir aside to horatio dost know this water fly insignificant creature aside to hamlet no my good lord aside to horatio thy state of not knowing osric is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt let a beast dirt when a man regardless of his human worth becomes lord of something he gains favor at court and dines with the king hes nothing but a crow chough but as i say he has lots of dirt land sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit your bonnet to his right use tis for the head your head put your hat on its for the head osric had removed his hat to show his respect probably insincere for prince hamlet i thank your lordship tis very hot no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly it is indifferent somewhat cold my lord indeed but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as twere i cannot tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter i beseech you remember hamlet moves him to put on his hat nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences qualities that set him apart from others of very soft society gentle upbringing and great showing impressive appearance indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card standard or calendar example of gentry for you shall find in him the continent complete package of what part a gentleman would see of what a gentleman should be sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more sir nothing more sir your description of him is glowing and i realize that trying to present an inventory of all of his good qualities would make you dizzy if he were the captain of a ship we couldnt catch him no matter how much we yawed swerved this way or that truly in praising him i must say he is a great soul he is unique when he looks into a mirror he sees the only one who can equal him everyone else who would follow him walks in his shadow umbrage your lordship speaks most infallibly of him the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath the concernancy breath why are we talking about this man sir is t not possible to understand in another tongue cant you talk to him in plainer language you will do t sir really what imports the nomination of this gentleman what is the purpose of bringing up this subject of laertes his purse is empty already all s golden words are spent of him sir i know you are not ignorant i would you did sir in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i would me im glad you know that sir but im not satisfied you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself i mean sir for his weapon fencing skill but in the imputation reputation laid on him by them in his meed ability hes unfellowed unrivaled whats his weapon rapier and dagger thats two of his weapons but well the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary north african horses against the which he has imponed pledged staked as i take it six french rapiers and poniards daggers with their assigns accessories as girdle belt hangers straps attached to the belt to hold up a scabbard and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit what call you the carriages i knew you must be edified by the margent be curious about the meaning of some words ere you had done the carriages sir are the hangers the phrase would be more german germane pertinent to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides if you were talking about cannons instead of swords i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish why is this imponed as you call it the king sir hath laid wagered that in a dozen passes between yourself and him laertes he shall not exceed you three hits shall not defeat you by no more than three hits in other words the king supposedly is betting on hamlet if laertes spots the prince three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine twelve hits for laertes to nine hits for hamlet and it would come to immediate trial a match held right now if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer how if i answer no i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial let me be clear my lord im talking about testing yourself in a competition against laertes sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits sir i will odd hits sir i will walk here in the hall its the time of day when i like to get exercise meanwhile let the preparation begin for the fencing match i will try to fight to make the king win his bet if i fail i will suffer only a little shame and some hits from laertes sword shall i re deliver you so shall i quote you on that to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will to will you may tell him the gist of what i said with whatever fancy words youd like to add i commend my duty to your lordship yours yours exit osric he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for s turn he does turn he does well to commend his duty no one else will commend him for anything this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head this head the lapwing a small bird can move around moments after it hatches it may run off even when pieces of its shell are still attached to its body he did comply with his dug before he sucked it he used to praise the nipple of his mother or wet nurse before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same bevy kind that i know the drossy worthless trivial age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out only got out his only talent is to act like everyone else and speak the same words yesty collection that carry his kind through their conversations and opinions winnowed of substance they try to attach great meaning to their words but the words are full of air like bubbles enter a lord lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play fence with laertes or that you will take longer time his majesty time after the king sent osric to deliver his message to you osric reported back to the king and now asks you to meet him in the hall he wishes to know whether you want to have the fencing match now or later i am constant to my purposes they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now lord the king and queen and all are coming down in happy time that suits me well lord the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment gentle words or treatment to laertes before you fall to play she well instructs me exit lord you will lose this wager my lord i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter but heart but be aware that i feel a bit uneasy in my heart nay good my lord it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman it is woman its really nothing rather like a misgiving that would perhaps trouble a woman if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither stop them from coming and say you are not fit not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what is t to leave betimes let be not a let be no dont do that i defy omens or foreboding feelings after all it is god who oversees our destiny if a sparrow dies now it was meant by heaven to die now and not later if the sparrow does not die now it was meant by heaven to die later see matthew in the new testament of the bible what is important is to be prepared for whatever happens to you no man retains anything of what he leaves behind when he dies so what does it matter if a man dies an early death let things stand as they are enter king queen laertes lords osric and attendants with

sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither march within enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others where is this sight what is it ye would see if aught anything of woe or wonder cease your search if aught search if you mean anything tragic or terrible to behold this is the place this quarry harvest of animals hunted down killed and piled in a heap cries on havoc disorder chaos destruction o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck o proud struck o death you must be planning a great banquet in your eternal abode considering that you took the lives of so many royal persons in a single moment first the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him king claudius his commandment is fulfilld that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks where thanks since the king is dead he cannot thank us for delivering our message not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question but question but since you wonder what happened here that spilled so much blood you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrivd give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause and in this upshot purposes mistook falln on the inventors heads all this can i truly deliver and in deliver and ironically murderous plots that went awry and killed the very persons who hatched them i can tell you the whole story let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience call the noblemen hereabouts to listen for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory entitlements in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me which me which i now plan to claim of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performd even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen of that happen on this matter id like to disclose to you hamlets last wishes even at this upsetting time so that we can avoid further plots and upheavals let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have provd most royally and for his passage for he royally for he was likely had he lived to have been a great ruler the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss such a sight amiss this site is appropriate for a battlefield but not for a hall in a kings castle go bid the soldiers shoot a dead march exeunt bearing off
